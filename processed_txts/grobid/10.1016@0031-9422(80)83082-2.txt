INTRODUCTION
Iryanthera laeuisMarkgr. (Myristicaceae), a tree which may attain a height of 25 m, occurs in central Amazonia [2]. A sample of trunk wood of a specimen, collected in the vicinity of Manaus, yielded besides sitosterol, 7 flavonoids which were classified by trivial 'H NMR assignments into dihydrochalcone [3], flavan [4] and 1,3-diarylpropane [5] types. As a further common feature of 2m and 2b, the presence of the additional hydroxyl at C-7 was assumed on biogenetical grounds. Only constitutions 2a and 2b can thus be written for these isomers. A third alternative, with the C-methyls at C-5 and C-6 need not be considered, since allylic coupling of the lone A-ring protons to one of these methyls can be demonstrated for both compounds from 'H NMR experiments.
RJlSULlSIn order to assign formulae to these compounds, 2d is a suitable model. Its three A-ring H signals occur at 7 3.05 (H-5), 3.48 (H-6) and 3.60 (H-8) in CDC13 [4], evidence that the /aez,is, like the other six species of the genus so far examined [6]. moved to be a rich source of flavans and 1,3-diarylpropanes, compound types whose biosynthetic connection has been postulated [7]. No neolignans were so far isolated from any lryanfhera species. By contrast, in the geographically and morphologically related genus Virola, flavans have not yet been found and 1,3_diarylpropanesshow comparatively slight structural variation, while neohgnans are widespread [6].

EXPERIMENTAL' and AB (J= 2 Hz) systems consistent only with the oxygenation pattern shown in la. The relative placement of the hydroxyls and the methoxyls relied on the MS and the fact that only one hydroxyl is easily methylated. The other hydroxyl in la and in the methyl ether (lc) is chelated (AlCl, UV shifts). Its acetylation leads to unsymmetrical acetates (lb, ld), a fact which confirms structure la for the natural com-R'=R'=H lb R'=R*=Ac lc R'=H,R*=Me Id R'=Ac,R'=Me *Part 14 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Myristicaceae". For Part 13 see ref. [l]. Based on the M.S. Thesis submitted by M. S. da S. to Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (1979). All three flavans, C,5H,0(OH)202CH2.Mez (2a, 2b) , as shown in 2. Indeed, not only does the base peak at m/e 164 of all three MS reveal OH.O,CH,-substitution of the retro Diels-Alder styryl fragment, but the presence only of singlets in the 'H NMR spectra excludes any but the 2'-OH-4',5'-O&HZ-arrangement.
3.25 signal (also in CDClJ of 2a refers to H-5, slightly shielded by the ortho-and para-related C-methyls. The 3.34 signal of 2b thus must refer to H-6 by default. Here comparison is not as valid since the spectrum was taken in (CD&CO.With respect to the third flavan, it is again reasonable to assume the presence of an oxy-function at C-7 and, since here the acetate derived ring is fully substituted, alsp at C-58.00 shift to 8.04 and 7.95. A symmetrical arrangement of the methyls with respect to the hydroxyl thus becomes improbable, and formula 2c is proposed for the natural compound. Among the four 1,3_diarylpropanes, 3n-c are known compounds, having been isolated respectively from Iryanthera coriacea Ducke [S] and I. polyneuru Ducke [3]. The substitution pattern of the fourth 1.3-diarylpropane C,,H,,,(OH),OMe.O,CHZ.Me was again elucidated initially by MS. This, through an outstandingly intense tropylium peak at m/e 15 1 (100%) [accompanied by a quinone methide peak of moderate intensity at m/e 150 (8"/0)], indicated the generation of ions of equal masses by both benzyhc cleavages, thus assigning OH.O,CH, functions to one ring and OH.OMe.Me groups to the other. Chemical shifts and multiplicities (all singlets) of the NMR signals due to the aromatic protons locate these substituents unequivocally as shown in 3d or 3e. The compound represented by 3d bears 2'-and 2"-hydroxyls and its MS should contain. besides the tropylium peak, a strong quinone methide peak (cf. intensity relation for m/e lSl/lSO peaks of model 3f: 100130 [5]). In view of the intensity ratio stated above, formula 3e becomes thus somewhat more plausible as representation of the natural compound (cf. intensity relation for m/e 151/150 peaks of model 3g: 100112 [S]).
