Limonoids from Toona data and Speculations on their Chemosystematic and Ecological Significance
Evolution of limonoids in the Meliaceae appears to be consistent with the resistance of Melioideae against the shoot borer Hypsipyla. The limonoid chemistn/ of Toona, which has shown absence of attacks of H. grandella, is reminiscent of Melioideae. An investigation of ?I cilafa, has led to the identification of two novel meliacin butenolides, 21-hydroxycedrelonelide and 23-hydroxycedrelonelide, two known limonoids, cedrelone and 23_hydroxytoonacilide, and sitosterol, a-amyrin and fi-amyrin acylated with fatty acids. Three known coumarins, siderin, scopoletin and isofraxidin were also isolated. All structures were established from spectral data. Some 'X NMR signals for cedrelone are reassigned.

Introduction (Grijipma, 1970).To determine the phytochemical basis of this resistance we have now undertaken a further investigation of the stem of the exotic Z cilata. hexane, 4:10:30). The triterpenes and sitosterol, obtained by hydrolysis, were acylated with acetic anhydride in pyridine prior to analysis by low resolution GC-MS.

Results and Discussion
Evolution of limonoids in the
Isolation of compoundsThe hexane extract from the stem of T. ciliata, afforded two new meliacin butenolides 2 and 3, besides two known limonoids cedrelone (4) and 23-hydroxytoonacilide, and a mixture of sitosterol, 0¢-amyrin and ~amyrin acylated with fatty acids. The known compounds were characterized by comparison with published spectral data (Halsall and Troke, 1975;Kraus and Grimminger, 1980).Compound 2 exhibited similar spectral data to cedrelone (4). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1), instead of signals for a furan unit, showed two broad singlets (G 5.90 and 5,84) suggesting a y-hydroxybutyrolactone. This was corroborated by the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which showed signals for a hemiacetal carbon (G 98.2 C-21) and an ¢,l~-unseturated-7-1actone (G 151.9, C-20; 119.8, C-22 and 168-2, C-23).These signals indicate the presence of a 21-hydmxy-20( 22)-ene-21,23-h'-Iactone by comparison with the 1H and 13C NMR data published for isonimocinolid (5) and nimocinolid (6) (Siddiqui et al., 1986). Moreover, the chemical shifts of the ring A-D carbons were comparable with those reported for cedrelone (Halsall and Troke, 1975) (Table 2). The new natural product is therefore 21-hydmxycedrelonelide (2). Compound 3 showed spectral characteristics close to those of 2. The principal change observed in the ~HNMR (Table 1) of 3 was the deshielded resonances (G 6.80 and 5.99) for a y-hydroxybutyrolactone. This was also supported by the ~3C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which agreed closely with published date for a 23-3'-hydroxybutenolide moiety related to that of 6. The structure of the new natural product was thus established as 23-hydroxycedrelonelide (3). As a further confirmation of the assignments, cedrelone was oxidized to a mixture of 2 and 3 by a photo-oxidation reaction. The mixture was separated by preparative TLC. Compounds 2 and 3 could be artefacts of the isolation procedures. However, the stem examined here gave 23-hydroxytoonacilide and no 21-hydroxytoonacilide. Thus, this observation suggested that both 2 and 3 are naturally occurring. The 1H-13C COSY and DEPT experiments on cedrelone, permitted minor corrections to previous 13C NMR assignments (Halsall and Troke, 1975) (Tables 123). Table 2 shows that the signals for C-9, 11, 12, 17, 21, 23 and 28 were reassigned.The methanol extract from the stem of T. ciliata gave three coumarins which were identified by comparison with published data as scopoletin (Wagner and Bladt, 1975), siderin (Nagasampagi et al., 1975) and isofraxidin (Borris et al., 1980). This appears to be the first record of isofraxidin from Meliaceae or from the allied families of the order Rutales (Rutaceae, Simaroubaceae, Cneoraceae and Burseraceae).As a result of this study T. ciliata has been shown to have a chemical profile that is closely comparable to that of Trichilia (Silva et aL, 1984;Silva and Gottlieb, 1987). The occurrence of the meliacin butenolides is a feature of both Toona (Kraus and Grimminger, 1980) and Trichilia (Arenas and Hahn, 1990;Cortez et al., 1992]. Thus, the The resistance of exotic T. ciliata and Trichilia species to native Hypsipyla may well be owing to the presence of the A,B-seco limonoids (1.2, 1.2.1). The B-seco limonoids, toonacilin and its 6-acetoxy derivative and their oxidized furan derivatives, isolated from T. ciliata, have shown activity as feeding repellents against the Mexican bean beetle Epilachna varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (Champagne et al., 1992). However, it is premature to draw any conclusions about the role of limonoids in a possible coevolutionary relationship between Meliaceae and Hypsipyla, until isolated limonoids can be evaluated in direct bioassays with this insect.Efforts to establish large-scale homogeneous plantations of native Meliaceae have almost invariably failed due to larval attacks by the shoot borer Hypsipyla (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The host range of thrs oligophagous pantropical genus is limited principally to the Swietenioideae. Of this sub-family, important species of the genera Khaya and Entandmphmgma in Africa, Swietenia and Cedrela in Latin America and Toona in Asia and Australia are attacked. However, Toona ciliata introduced to Brazil shows excellent growth and an absence of attacks by H. grandella, in contrast to the native Cedrela odorata. The latter has been grafted to stems of b cilata and the resistance has been translocated from the Mona stock to the Cedrela graft

Cedreloideae Chemically, the family Meliaceae is distinguished by the frequent occurrence of extremely characteristic limonoids which are easily connected by mechanistically justifiable biogenetic reasoning from a common precursor (Scheme 1). This precursor, 1, suffers oxidative opening of rings B/D to give 1.1 and 1.1.1, or of rings A/B/D to 1.1.2, or of rings A/B to 1.2 and 1.2.1, or of ring C to 1.3. Genera of Swietenioideae contain meliacins formed along only one biosynthetic route (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1,2, Scheme 1). In contrast, genera of Melioideae, the other major
the Cedreloideae, represented by Cedrela and Toona, is more complex. Pennington and Styles, in their more recent monograph, include Harms' Cedreloideae into the Swietenioideae and particularly the Cedreleae (Harms, 1940; Pennington and Styles, 1975), The known limonoids (1, 1.1, Scheme 1) from Cedrela are typical of the Swietenioideae subfamily (Silva et al., 1984). On the other hand, the limonoid chemistry of Toona (1, 1.2, Scheme 1) is reminiscent of Melioideae, since the known compounds comprise intact ring-D and ring-A/ring-B dilactones, a feature typical of Trichilia limonoids (1, 1.2.1, Scheme 1) (Silva et al., 1984; Silva and Gottlieb, 1987). Thus, the affiliation of Toona to the Swietenioideae is rather problematic. The difference in meliacin composition in Pennington's tribe Cedreleae appears to be consistent with the resistance of exotic Toona to native H. grandella. The elucidation of the toxicant(s) present in Toona could clarify the basis for resistance.
