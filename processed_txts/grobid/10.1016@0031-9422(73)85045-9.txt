6-PHENYLETHYL-5,6-DIHYDRO-2-PYRONES FROM A NIBA GZGANTIFOLIA"
&He--CHCI,(1: 1) with the aid of a few ml of EtOH. Addition of 100 g of silica gel followed by evaporation of solvent gave a free-flowing powder which was placed on a column of 500 g of silicic acid and rechromatographed in the usual manner, 1 1. fractions being collected. The only solid material was found in fractions 91-93 (CHCI,-MeOH 99 : 1). Recrystallization afforded 0.25 g of 5,4 '-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone, m.p. 246-248" (lit 253-254",3 246-247" 4) , NMR signals (DMSO-d,) at 7.91 dand 6.90 d(J9, AzBz system of H-2', H-3', H-5' and H-6'), 6.62 d and 6.27 d (J 2, AB system of H-6 and H-8), 3.82 and 3.78 (two methoxyls), UV A,,, 352.5 and 267 nm, with added NaOAc 355 and 268 nm, with added AlCl, 352.5, 305 and 277 nm, with added NaOEt 395 and 270 nm, with added NaOAc-H,BO, 350 and 267 nm. Direct comparison with an authentic sample of 5,4'dihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone supplied by Prof. P. R. Jefferies established identity. Extraction of Barr No. 65-191 gave similar results. The present report corroborates the findings of Higo et al.' that A. eriocelztra yields no easily crystallizable homogeneous sesquiterpene lactone components. 5,4'-Dihydroxy-3,7dimethoxyflavone has previously been isolated from an unnamed new Beyeria species,3 from Alpinia Kumatake,4 A. japonica,5 Eucryphia lucida, Cistus ladanifera,7 Cheilanthes farizosa' and Larrea cuneifolia, g but not, to the best of our knowledge, from a Composite. Several Aniba species contain 4-methoxyd-styryl-2-pyrones (I).2 Metabolites of this type are accompanied in two Piper species by dihydro (II) and tetrahydro (III) deriva-* Part XXV in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae".

Schmidt*, of tetrahydroderivatives : the known dihydrokawain (IIIa), dihydromethysticin (IIIb)3 and tetrahydroiangonin (111~)~ and the new tetrahydro-1 l-methoxyiangonin (IIId). Additionally, anibine (IV), the pseudoalkaloid of A. rosaeodora Ducke and A. coto (Rusby) Kosterm.' was also found The separation of type III compounds is notoriously difficult,3*4 and only partial separation of the crude C6Hs or EtOH extracts into sitosterol, a mixture, IIId and IV, in order of increasing polarity, was achieved by silica column chromatography. The mixture was resolved by fractional crystallization from C6H, which gave pure IIIb in the first crop. The residual material was fractionated by careful chromatography on an alumina column. Light petrol.-Et,0 eluted successively pure IIIa, pure 111~ and impure IIIb. The structure of IIId was deduced from its PMR spectrum which was identical with the spectra of IIIa, IIIb and 111~ with the exception, of course, of the signals due to the protons and the substituents of the aromatic ring. The constitution of this ring was established through oxidation of IIId to veratric acid. The absolute configuration of the Piper products IIIa and IIIb is known.5 The ORD curve of a sample of IIIb ex Piper methysticum Forster, kindly supplied by Prof. R. Hginsel, Freie Universitgt Berlin, was superimposable on the analogous curves given by all type III constituents of A. gigantifilia. The same (6S)-configuration was consequently ascribed to all of them. EXPERIMENTAL Isolation ofthe constituents ofAniba gigantifolia. Powdered trunk wood (1.0 kg) was extracted successively with CsHB and EtOH. The C6He extract (27.5 g), redissolved in a little C6HL, crystallized in the refrigerator. The crystals (IIIb, 4.5 g) were separated by filtration. The filtrate was evaporated and the residue was chromatographed on a column of Merck's Kieselgel 0.05-0,20 mm. C6Hs eluted sitosterol (100 mg), C6Hs-AcOEt, 9: 1 eluted a mixture (12 g), C6H6-AcOEt, 4: 1 eluted IIId (6.5 g) and AcOEt-MeOH, 19: 1 eluted IV (420 mg). The mixture was fractionally crystallized from CsHs giving IIIb (9 g). The mother liquor was rechromatographed on a column of Merck's alumina G. Light petrol.-Et*0 9:l eluted IIIa (210 mg) and light petrol.-EtOz, 4: 1 eluted 111~ (150 mg). Other fractions contained mixtures of IIIa, IIIb and 111~. The EtOH extract (21.8 g) was treated in the same way as the CsHb extract. IIIb (680 mg) crystallized directly. Sitosterol (120 mg), IIIa + 111~ (380 mg), IIIb (730 mg), IIId (790 mg) and IV (1.5 g) were obtained by chromatographic techniques. * Herbarium specimen INPA (Manaus) 37397. The botanist W. Rodrigues, to whom we are indebted for the classification, reports that A. gigantifoliu has previously only been located at the Tapaj6s river (Par& State, Brasil) and in Peru. Near Manaus, where our specimen was collected, occurs A. hostmanniuna (Nees) Mez, which differs from A. giguntifih only with respect to the pillosity of the ovary, a fact which makes distinction between the two species very difficult. 3 SAUER, H. and H~~NSEL, R.
