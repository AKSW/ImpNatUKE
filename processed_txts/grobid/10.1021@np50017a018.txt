ESSESTIAL OILS FROM BRAZILIAN T7ERBENACEAE. GEKUS LIPPIA File
Species Collection' When Part studied ~ ,-ieldc.ABSTR.4CT.-EsseIltial oils from six species of the 1.erbenaceae family; L z p p i a alba, L . nlnifolici, L . u f l n i s nristeifn, L . uristain, L . grato and L . n j . sidoides were analyzed by gc-ms-computer library search programs. Several monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, aromatic compounds, alcohols, and ketones were identified.Thymol and a-phellandrene are the major constituents of the essential oil of L . off.

sidoides. The other five species contain mainly caryophyllene follom-ed by carvacrol in L . u172ifo/i(i and L . grato, y-cadinene in L .

These programs were written in BASIC language and implemented in our laboratory for automatic analysis of essential oils (21)(22). Confirmations of the identifications were carried out by visual comparison of the full ms with standards from a certified collection ( 2 3 ) , by other spectrometric  data and by comparison with authentic samples Ivhen they were available (see table 2). Lippia aJ. aristata (table 1) has some minor morphological differences as compared with the description of L. aris~ata in the literat'ure ( 24). E'rom table 2, it is seen that essential oils of both species have the same major constituents, i e . , P-caryophyllene, y-elemene, and limonene; a-phellandrene (1 .O%) was found only in Lippia aristata, u-hereas p-cymene (1.6%) n-as identified only in L. aff. aristata (see table 2 ) .-_ - - -,-elemene - - a-muurolene I - - -,-muurolene 0 4 - a-humulene 1 2 2 2 1 1 - - - - 1 - - - _ _ _ _ _ _ ~_ _ _Data from table 2 show that the essential oil of Lippia alba from Brazil is largely composed of P-caryophyllene (24.3YG) geranial (12.9Yc), neral (9.6y0), and 2-undecanone (9%,). These results do not agree with the chemical composition of the essential oil from the same species from Argentina which chiefly consist of dipentenes, d-limonene, and 1-piperitone ( 19).
EXPEKIAIESTALT h e plant materials were collected a t locations mentioned in table 1.Botanical identifications were made by A. G. Fernandes and P . Bezerra. A voucher of each species, under the number specified in table 1, is kept in the herbarium of Departamento de Biologia da Universidade Federal do Ceara, Brazil.Essential oil extraction (25) was carried out by steam distillation of finely ground material for approximately one hour. The yields are reported in table 1 .The fresh oils were analyzed in a Finnigan 3300 quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to gas chromatography with an open tubular glass column (30m x 0.25mm). S P . 2100 (methglsilicone) was used as the stationary phase. The gc experiments were carried out under programmed temperature conditions (50Â°-2500) a t a rate of 4"/min with helium as carrier gas. The ms fragmentations were carried out a t 70 eJ. electron impact. Mass chromatographic retention data were calculated as Kovat's indexes (26)  All d a t a processing was performed on a 6115 Finnigan computer with 32K bites of core memory equipped with a 3 megabite disk and with magnetic tapes.Other spectrometric data (nmr, ir) were obtained with the aid of Varian Ehl 360, Varian XL-100 nmr instruments and a Perkin Elmer 720 infrared spectrophotometer. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . s indeues:.b. nmr: c . ir.

by co-injection of the essential oil with eight standard n-hydrocarbons (Cg, Cg, Cia! C11! C12, (214, (316, and CIS). T h e reconstruction of the individual chromatograms of essential oil and n-hydrocarbons were carried out with ions m / z 91 and m / z 85, respectively (22).
