Pergamon Press Pnnted m England NEW PELTOGYNOIDS FROM THREE PELTOGYNE SPECIES*
Two novel peltogynoids, 7-0-methylpeltogynol and 4-O-methyl-4',5'-O,O-methylidenemopanol were isolated respectively from the trunk wood of Peltogyne paniculatn Benth. and P. confertijora Benth. The latter species, as well as P. catingar Ducke, also contain the common peltogynoids peltogynol and mopanol. * Part XL111 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Leguminosae". For Part XL11 see Ref. 1. Taken, in part, from the M.Sc. theses submitted by M.E. DE A. and M.A.T. to the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (1973).

A RECENT investigation of Goniorrhachis marginata Taub. (Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae) revealed the existence in its heartwood of peltogynoid flavanones and chalcones.'.' The genus was, consequently, considered to have evolved into Peltogyne, the known species of which contain mainly peltogynoid flavonols.2 Since Goniorrhachis is monotypic, the only way of placing this hypothesis on firmer ground and, eventually, to use it as basis of a phyletic classification of related genera, requires the analysis of additional Peltogyne species.A search for peltogynoids in the bark of Peltogyne confertijlora Benth. (from Espirito Santo State), P. catingae Ducke and P. panicdata Benth. (both from Amazonas State) was unsuccessful. Only a glycoside of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin) was located in P. confertijora. The heartwoods, however, of P. catingae and P. confertij?ora were found to contain peltogynol (la) and mopanol (2a), typical constituents of Peltogyne and related genera. From the C,H, extracts of P. panicdata and P. confertiflora two additional phenols, respectively C, ,H1 606 and C, sH1606, were isolated. Their UV spectra were very similar to those of peltogynol and mopanol, so they were considered to be closely related peltogynoids. Comparisons of the PMR spectra in the acetate series not only confirmed this (see chemical shifts of aliphatic protons with lit.3 data), but also indicated identical relative configurations at the chiral centres 2, 3 and 4 (cf. 52.3 and J,.,). Attribution of the substitution pattern of peltogynol to C17H1606 and of mopanol to C, sH I 6O6 was based on the analysis of the aromatic spectral regions.

In consequence, H-2' of Ig and If resonates at higher field (rcsp. T 2.82 and 2.90) than H-2' of Id and lb (resp, r 2.49 and 2.53).
The methylenedioxy group (r 4.06, s) of the mopanol derivative C,,H,,O, can, of course, occupy only the 4',5'-positions. Three pieces of evidence show that the methoxyl (t 6.38, s) is at C-4 : (1). The H-4 chemical shifts of the acetate (2e) and of tri-Oacetylmopanol (2b) are comparable (r 5.35 and 5.33) suffering the expected large downfield shift (A -1.59 ppm) if the hydroxyl at C-4 appears in acetylated form, as in 2c (2). The MS of the derivative (Scheme 1) conforms to the pattern observed for other flavanols of this series2 with the exception of the [M-H,O]+: peak which is replaced by a strong [M-MeOH]+'peak (3).
