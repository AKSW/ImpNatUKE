HUMIRIANTHENOLIDES, NEW DEGRADED DITERPENOIDS FROM HUMIRIANTHERA RUPESTRIS*
The tuber of Humirianthera rupestris (Icacinaceae) contains the degraded diterpenoids 3fi,20-epoxy-3uhydroxy-14-oxo-9j&podocarpan-19,6/J-olide (humirianthenolide A), 3/?,20-epoxy-3cr,14u-dihydroxy-9B-podocarpan-19,6j%olide (humiri'anthenolide B), 3/?,20; 16,14-diepoxy-3cl-hydroxy-17-nor-15-oxo-9~-abiet-l3-en-l9,6~-olide (humirianthenolide C), 3B,20-epoxy-3a,14-dihydroxy-13-oxo-9B-podocarp-8( 14)-en-l9,6~-olide (humirianthenolide D), 3B,20-epoxy-3a-hidroxy-14-oxo-8cr,9B-podocarpan-l9,6~-olide (humirianthenolide E) and 3B,20-epoxy-3cr,14/& dihydroxy-%x,9/&podocarpan-19,6j&olide (humirianthenolide F). 'H NMR and ' 3C NMR spectroscopy were effective for the determination of the humirianthenolide structures.

INTRODUCTIONHumirianthera rupestris (Icacinaceae) is a shrub whose tuber, weighing about 40 kg, is eaten like flour after several water washings [l 1. A chemical investigation of a tuber collected in Manaus (Amazon) Brazil revealed the presence of six new degraded diterpenoids.
RESULTSThe benzene and ethanol extracts from the tuber of Humirianthera rupestris contained sitosterol and six crystalline substances, for which the names humirianthenolide A (la), B (lb), C (2a), D (3), E (4a) and F (4b) are proposed.  1 and2). Thus. for la, the two A/B ring pattern as shown in structure 1. This assumption protons on C-20 showed '.Ju,n values of relatively large was confirmed by the strong similarity between the 'H magnitudes implying W-type arrangements.   other proton of the oxymethylene was located over ring B and showed an even larger 4&i coupling (3SHz), presumably with H-Lx. H-6 appeared as a broad triplet, with almost no coupling with H-78. This observation is best explained by a chair-ring B with the lactonic oxygen substituent in an axial position. The saturated ketone function must be located at C-14, in view of the low-field absorption of H-8. The coupling pattern of this hydrogen showed only one proton in an anti relationship and this must be H-7cr (axial). Therefore, the B/C ring junction was cis, with both H-8 and H-9 b-orientated.In the ' 3C NMR spectrum (Table 3) this arrangement was reflected by the high-field position of C-l 1, which was axial to ring B in addition to the gauche relationship with C-l (three yeffects). Thus this compound has structure la.Humirianthenolide B (lb) had two more mass units than la and was converted to the latter by Jones oxidation. The stereochemistry of the alcohol function was defined by the 'H and i3C NMR spectral data. Thus, the carbinolic proton signal had splittings consistent with an equatorial hydroxyl group (Table 2). This was confirmed by the invariance of the C-12 absorption and the shelding of the C-7 by the gauche hydroxyl group. The IR spectral data showed that the lactone carbonyl of lb had both intra-and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds (with 3-OH and 14-OH, respectively, giving a band at 1760cm-' that was eliminated by conversion to derivative le, which had no free hydroxyl groups). The flarrangement of the y-lactone and hemiacetal functions was also indicated by an alkaline hydrolysis of lb, which resulted in a retro-aldol reaction, in agreement with previous observations [2,3]. In our case, a 2: 1 mixture of the isomers 5a and 5b, respectively, was obtained. The characteristic feature of the 'H NMR spectrum of these compounds was the splitting of the methyl signal into a Sa Rt=H,R'=Me Sh R' = Me, R2 = H doublet, and therefore indicating the presence of a 4-H. In the major compound, the signal of the latter proton was not split further than a quartet, indicating an approximately 90" dihedral angle with H-5. In the minor product, such a coupling existed (7.5 Hz). This is consistent with the configurations shown in formula 5. Humirianthenolide C (2a), with the same ring A and B pattern as compound 1, had two additional carbon atoms. IR (1700, 164Ocm-'), UV (nzi,"" 267nm, E~OOOO), i3CNMR (three singlets at 6200.6, 191.4 and 111.2) and 'H NMR (6 3.78, s, 2 H) spectra define a dihydrofuran-4one moiety. The allylic nature of H-8 (6 2.73) and the high- *Residual couplings in the single frequency off-resonance decoupled spectra were used in some cases to help assignment. Spectra for la, 2a and 3 were measured at 22.6 MHz, for lb at 25.2MHz and for lc at 20MHz. jCDC1,; TMS internal standard. $A few drops of MeOH were added to improve solubility. $DMSO-ds; the solvent peak was taken as 6 39.5. field position of C-l 2 (17.7), shielded by a y-effect on the carbonyl oxygen, located the side-chain as shown in 2.Humirianthenolide D (3) had an enolized a-diketone system, as shown by IR (1670 and 1650 cm-'), UV (2%:" 272nm, E 10 500) and r3C NMR (three singlets at 6 192.8, 144.9 and 129.0). C-8 was part of this system. since one of the hydrogens on C-7 was strongly deshielded by the rtsystem and its signal showed only coupling to H-6, in addition to the geminal splitting. The signals in the 'H and "CNMR spectra due to the A-and B-ring nuclei were slightly changed in 3 relative to compounds 1 and 2. A very diagnostic feature was the shape ofthe H-6 signal, a quartet with three couplings (to H-5, H-7a and H-7p) of 8 Hz. The sp* nature of C-8, a bridgehead carbon, forces ring B into a boat conformation, with different dihedral angles between its peripheral protons. H-9 remains porientated, since the alternative configuration would entail more drastic changes, e.g. a y-effect between C-20 and C-11. Instead, C-11 is deshielded by the loss of a gauche interaction with C-7, now above the plane of the boat-shaped ring B. Humiroanthenolide E $a) was an isomer of la and, indeed, its IR spectrum showed the presence of a saturated ketone (1700cm-').However, it differed from la in the geometry of rings B and C, H-6 being split by large coupling constants by all its three neighbours. This pattern was strongly reminiscent of the one described for 3, suggesting a trans junction between rings B and C, and a boat-like ring B, similar to 3 where C-8 was sp2hybridized. One of the two protons on C-7 absorbed at low-field (6 2.67), indicating that the ketone was probably located at C-14. The small coupling between this proton and H-8 was in agreement with a quasi-equatorial and axial positioning, respectively, for these lwo hydrogen atoms.Humirianthenohde F (4b) had the same molecular weight as lb and its molecular ion in the MS lost two molecules of water, as was the case with lb (but not with la or 4a, which lost only one water molecule), indicating the presence of an hydroxyl group other than the one located at C-3. The truns nature of the B/C ring junction was determined by the shape of the 'H NMR signal of H-6 which was very similar to that in the spectrum of4a. The proton spectrum showed also a carbinolic hydrogen as a multiplet with WI/, = I Hz, which was only consistent with an axial secondary alcohol. Biogenetic considerations would suggest that the hydroxyl is located at C-14.The configurations shown in formulae 14 are meant to be relative. The fact that they also may represent absolute configurations follows from the similarity of the ORD curve of lb (see Experimental)and the ORD curves of momilactones A and B [3].Only four diterpenoids with the phenanthrene skeleton feature a frans-syn stereochemistry, i.e. with H-9 and C-20 in a cis relationship.These are annonalide [3] and momilactones A, B [2] and C [4], all of which are A' compounds.This work, therefore, constitutes the first example of diterpenoids with tran~~syn--cis and trans-syn-tram arrangements. While the former stereochemistry predominates in this species, an interconversion of the two forms by the enolization ofa 14carbonyl function, as shown in compound 3, could be visualized. The apparently lower stability of the B/C tram ringjunctionmay bearesultofthe boat-likeformsofring B that must be assumed in these compounds.The humirianthenolides may derive from successive oxidative degradations of a precursor with an abietane skeleton. This sequence could start with the removal ofone of the methyls of the isopropyl side-chain, leaving a carbonyl group in its place, as in compound 2a. Since this product contains a masked /I-diketone functionality, a retro-aldol reaction would lead to compounds oxidized in ring C only at C-14, such as I and 5.
