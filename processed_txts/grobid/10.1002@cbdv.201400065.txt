Triterpenoids as Novel Natural Inhibitors of Human Cathepsin L
Cathepsins L (catL) and B play an important role in tumor progression and have been considered promising therapeutic targets in the development of novel anticancer agents. Using a bioactivity-guided fractionation, a series of triterpenoids was identified as a new class of competitive inhibitors towards cathepsin L with affinity values in micromolar range. Among the 14 compounds evaluated, the most promising were 3-epiursolic acid (3), 3-(hydroxyimino)oleanolic acid (9), and 3-(hydroxyimino)masticadienoic acid (13) with IC 50 values of 6.5, 2.4, and 2.6 mm on catL, respectively. Most of the evaluated triterpenoids do not inhibit cathepsin B. Thus, the evaluated compounds exhibit a great potential to help in the design of new inhibitors with enhanced potency and affinity towards catL. Docking studies were performed in order to gain insight on the binding mode and SAR of these compounds.

Introduction. -Lysosomal cysteine proteases are characterized by having similar amino acid sequences, and they share a common papain-like folding structure [1] [2]. Cathepsin L (catL) is an enzyme active only as endopeptidase, containing two domains, with Cys25, His163, and Asn187 forming the catalytic triad [3]. On the other hand, cathepsin B (catB) is a carboxypeptidase, which can act, depending on the pH, both as endopeptidase or exopeptidase. The main feature of catB is the occluding loop which comprises the His110 and His111 residues [1] [3].Increases in cysteine protease expression and activity have been associated with many types of human carcinomas such as colorectal [4], melanome [5], breast [6], and brain tumors [7]. Recently reported as important targets in tumor progression, catB and catL play an important role in angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis [1] [2] [8] [9] which have been considered the major cause of death from cancer [1]. It has been reported that cancer-associated proteases can be secreted by tumor cells acting on the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane [2] [8]. Therefore, these cathepsins have been identified as promising therapeutic targets and are of special interest in the development of novel anticancer agents.Plants are one of the largest sources of active compounds, and advances in cancer treatment require the continuing development of novel agents [10]. Over the past years, natural products have played an important role in medicine, as a source not only of potential chemotherapeutic agents, but also used as lead compounds in semisynthesis or total synthesis of new drugs [11] [12]. Triterpenoids are a widespread group of natural products occurring in several types of higher plants and organisms. These compounds present a broad range of pharmacological properties [13] [14] such as anticancer [14], antibacterial [15], anti-inflammatory [16], anti-AIDS [17], and cytotoxic activities [18].We have been interested in finding new cysteine protease inhibitors, and we previously described acridone alkaloids isolated from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl. ) Merr. (Rutaceae) as cathepsin V inhibitors [19]. Continuing the search for new enzyme inhibitors, in the present study we have screened several natural triterpenes and some of their derivatives against catB and catL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing these triterpenoids as inhibitors of human catL.Results and Discussion. -Chemistry. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the hexane active fraction from the stems of Myrcia lingua Berg. (Myrtaceae) resulted in the isolation of active acidic triterpenes such as 3-O-acetylursolic acid (1) [20], ursolic acid (2) [21], and 3-epiursolic acid (3; Fig. 1) [22]. To better investigate this class, some other compounds previously isolated in the laboratory of natural products were also evaluated against the proteases. 3-Oxoursolic acid (4) [23] was isolated from the stem bark of Vochysia thyrsoidea (Vochysiaceae). Compound 1 was treated with CH 2 N 2 [24] to give the corresponding methyl ester 5 [24]. Oleanolic acid (Aldrich O5504, ! 97%; 6) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and some other derivatives were obtained as indicated below. Compound 6 was acetylated with Ac 2 O in pyridine [25], resulting in the 3-O-acetyloleanolic acid [25] (7). In addition, 3-oxooleanolic acid (8) [25] was obtained via oxidation of 6 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) and CH 2 Cl 2 [26]. Compound 8 was subjected to a reaction with NH 2 OH • HCl in MeOH as described in [27] to afford the 3-(hydroxyimino) derivative 9 [27]. Masticadienoic acid (10) [28] [29] and schinol (11) [29] were isolated from the fruit of Schinus terebinthifolius (Anacardiaceae). Compound 10 was also treated with CH 2 N 2 [24] to give the corresponding methyl ester 12 [28] [29]. Compounds 10 and 12 were then subjected to a reaction with NH 2 OH • HCl in MeOH [27] to afford the 3-(hydroxyimino) derivatives 13 [28] [29], 14 [28] [29], respectively. All compounds (Fig. 1) were isolated and identified by chromatographic and spectral methods, and all the obtained data were compared with those in the literature.Bioactivity-Guided Fractionation. Using bioactivity-guided fractionation to find novel natural inhibitors of catB and catL, several native plants from the cerrado biome were screened against these enzymes, leading to a group of active triterpenes isolated from Myrcia lingua Berg. Among the obtained extracts from cerrado plants, the crude extracts from M. lingua showed significant inhibitions on the evaluated enzymes and were further selected to the isolation process. All extracts and fractions were evaluated at a concentration of 125 mg/ml. The inhibition of EtOH extract was higher than 91% on both enzymes, although the hexane fraction of the stems of M. lingua turned out to be the most active with inhibition higher than 90% on catL and 75% on catB.The isolation procedure of hexane fraction led to the known triterpenes 3-Oacetylursolic acid (1), ursolic acid (2), and 3-epiursolic acid (3). The enzymatic assay on cysteine proteases revealed that acidic triterpenes inhibited catL.Biochemical Evaluation of Natural Products and Derivatives. As a general procedure, the inhibition screen assay was first carried out at a concentration of 100 mm. To compare the potency and selectivity, we determined the IC 50 values for both cathepsins. The evaluated compounds showed good selectivity towards the enzymes.Eqn. 1 was used to calculate the percentage of inhibition:% Inhibition ¼ 100 Â (1 À V i /V 0 )(1)where V i and V 0 are initial velocities (enzyme activities) determined in the presence and in the absence of the inhibitor, respectively. Among the 14 compounds evaluated, the highest inhibitions were found for 3, 9, and 13 with IC 50 values of 6.5, 2.4, and 2.6 mm on catL, respectively (Table 1). The majority of the evaluated triterpenoids did not inhibit catB.It has been found that the more common structural modifications on triterpenes were at C(3) (OH group) and C(28) (COO group), and the obtained derivatives displayed enhanced pharmacological activities, especially anticancer properties [30]. Among the evaluated compounds, the presence of the C(28)OO group was important for the inhibitory potency of triterpenoids towards catL. It was also noticed that the presence of a hydroxyimino group at C(3) contributed significantly to the inhibition improvement. Evaluating the obtained data, we recognized that both triterpene skeletal types ursane and oleanane inhibited catL. Compounds 5, 12, and 14 completely lost their activity towards catL, when the COO group was transformed into the corresponding methyl ester, confirming the importance of a free C(28)OOH group for the activity towards catL.The results by Sporn et al. showed that the presence of methyl ester, amides and CN groups at C(28) of compound 6 contribute to enhance the activity toward cancer cells and also to the ability to decrease inflammation [31]. In contrast, our results on catL demonstrated that the C(28)OOH is strongly required to inactivate the enzymes.CatL and catB are the cysteine proteases strongly involved in metastasis, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion [1] [2] [8] [9]. Recent studies described compound 2 as inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) on rat C-6 glioma cells, and the IC 50 value was 20 mm for MMP-9 inhibition. MMPs are proteases also overexpressed in tumor cells and related to cell invasion and degradation of ECM [30] [32] [33]. Interestingly, ursolic acid and its derivatives have been described as relatively nontoxic agents, which further focused our interest on this class of compounds [30] [32]. To establish a correlation between anticancer and cathepsin activity, we found in the literature that several triterpenoids with saponin, ursane, and oleanane skeletons are being tested as anticancer agents, and some of them are already on clinical trials [30].The most potent inhibitors were selected for further kinetic studies on catL to determine the type of inhibition and dissociation constants (K i ), although the kinetics of those compounds on catB were not investigated due to their low activity.Mechanism of Inhibition. Triterpenes 3, 6, 7, 9, and 13 were selected to determine the type of inhibition towards catL. The inhibition kinetics analyzed by Line-weaverÀBurk double reciprocal plots [34] revealed the series of triterpenoids as competitive inhibitors (Fig. 2); whereas the value of V max remained constant at all inhibitor concentrations, the apparent value of K m increased with increasing concentration of the inhibitor.The K i values for inhibitors 3, 6, 7, 9, and 13 are compiled in Table 2, and they confirm the evaluated triterpenoids as a new class of competitive inhibitors with affinity values in a mm range. Thus, these compounds display a potential to aid the design of new inhibitors with enhanced potencies and affinities towards catL.Molecular-Docking Studies. To gain some insight on the experimental inhibition data, docking studies were undertaken, and the results were compared to the poses in two crystal structures of the compounds with inhibitory activities in the nm order towards catL [35] [36]. In Table 3, the interactions of the different compounds with the amino acids of the subsites of catL are collated. It can be seen that the compounds in the crystallographic structures (pdb codes 2xu3 [35] and 2yj2 [36]) interact with amino acids of subsites S1, where the catalytic cys25 is located, S2, and S3. There are also a few interactions with amino acids of the S1' and S2' subsites (see Fig. 3).The finding that compounds with four rings undergo only a few interactions with amino acids of subsites S2 and S3 may explain their rather low inhibitory activity; moreover, those with the lowest activity do not get close to the catalytic cys25 [37] [38]. It should be noted that the five-membered ring compounds do not even interact with amino acids of the S2' subsite.Due to the size and rigidity of the triterpenoid ring systems, the molecules resemble in some way a cylinder that cannot pass through the narrow V-shaped channel that leads to the active site, preventing them from interacting with amino acids of subsites S2 and S3, which are important for the inhibitory activity [38].   3).

All commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma, and kinetic measurements were carried out in a fluorimeter Molecular Devices Spectra MAX M3. Inhibitory activity was measured using the synthetic fluorometric substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (benzyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanyl-arginine 4-methyl-7-coumarylamide) at a concentration of 185 mm for catB (K m 123 mm [43]: K m 157.5 mm) and 10 mm for catL (K m 1.2 mm [44]: K m 2.4 mm)) [44]. The molar concentrations of all active cathepsins were determined by titration using the irreversible inhibitor E-64 [45]. CatB was assayed at 62 nm and catL was assayed at 55 nm. The enzyme was activated during 5 min with DTE (1,4-dithioerythritol) and acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at 378, and then the mixture was incubated during 5 min with the sample. The experiments were carried out in triplicate (in 96-well black plates), and the final volume of the reaction mixture (200 ml) was kept under stirring (l exc 355 nm; l em 460 nm). All inhibitors were screened against catL and catB at an initial concentration of 100 mm. Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irreversible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control; 1-{N-[(l-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-lleucyl]amino}-4-guanidinobutane), which can irreversibly inhibit a wide range of cysteine peptidases and was first isolated and identified from Aspergillus japonicas in 1978 [46]. The IC 50 values were determined by rate measurements with at least seven inhibitor concentrations. The inhibition type and K i values were determined at the same experimental conditions. All kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot 12.0 enzyme kinetics module, and the type of inhibitor was established by LineweaverÀBurk plots of 1/V vs. 1/S at different inhibitor concentrations.Molecular Docking. The three-dimensional structures of catL and catB were obtained from the Protein Data Bank [47] (PDB code 2XU3 [35] and 1GMY [48], resp.). Docking studies were performed using the GOLD program version 5.1 with the GoldScore function [49 -51]. For the analysis of the results, the graphical program Discovery Studio Visualizer 3.5 was used [52].Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1. Chemical structures of triterpenes and derivatives

Table 3 .3Interactions between the Ligands and CatL Residues and Their Inhibition Values.A specific catL inhibitor should interact with the S2, S3, and S1' subsites besides S1 which contains the catalytic cysteine[38]. It can be observed that compounds like 5 are not good inhibitors due to lack of interactions with S1' subsite, neither would be compound 12 that do not interact with the catalytic cysteine (yellow). For comparison, the crystallographic results for two inhibitors in catL, pdb codes 2xu3 and 2xy2, are shown. The subsites are named according to the nomenclature of Schechter[39], and residues areand Berger
