The second compound eluted by CC of the oily material analysed for CZ205HZZ, Mf m/z 366 and was a 7oxygenated isoflavone as shown by UV and 'H NMR (6 7.80, associated with H-2 and I,,, 264, strong, and 292 weak [4]. Its M+ was 14mu higher than that of 2 and its UV spectrum was also almost identical to that of 2 except that it was not affected by NaOH. The 'H NMR spectrum at 60 MHz showed two OMe groups (6 3.78, s, 6 H), the absence of a -0-H proton (no change with D,O) and the same proton aromatic proton pattern as that of 2. From these data structure 5 was assigned to this compound.

INTRODUCTIONFive isoflavones and three pyranoisoflavones have been isolated from seeds of Calopogonium mucunoides by Vilain and Jadot [l-3 j. In the present study we describe the isolation and structural determination of three new isoflavones and a new pyranoflavanone from the seeds of the same plant grown in Brazil, none of them identical with those obtained by Vilain. However, the compounds isolated in each case have similar structural features. CC on Si gel of the solid and oily material obtained from the concentrated ChH6 extract of C. mucunoides each gave, on elution with hexane containing increasing amounts of CHCI, and then CHCI, with increasing amounts of MeOH, two pure compounds together with other constituents not fully studied. The first component eluted by CC of the solid material analysed for Czz0,H2,. M t ~1.': 380. Both the 'H NMR and UV spectra were typical of 7-oxygenated isoflavones showing the H-2 proton at d 7.8,s, and coupled resonances (J = 9 Hz) at b 8.05 and 7.05 for the C-5 and C-6 protons, respectively. The UV spectrum exhibited two absorption maximaat (.\)and295 (n)nm [4]. Complete400MHz 'H NMR spectrum analysis revealed the presence of two hydrogens on ring A (H-5 and H-6. by use of double irradiation and INDOR techniques) and three hydrogens on ring B (H-2', H-5' and H-6' by use of the same techniques), a dioxymethylene group (d 6.0. s). a methonyl group (6 4.0. s) and a 0-prenylated group (6 1.58, 1.62, 4.71 and 6.52). The MS showed fragments indicating that the prenyl group was on ring A, the oxygen at position 7 (WL/Z = 311, loo",,) and the dioxymethylene on ring B (m;~ = 146, 8""). From these data structure 1 was assigned to thiscompound and IR, UV, MS and 'H NMR spectra were in complete agreement. The second and more polar compound analysed for C,,O,H,,,, Mi m.': 352 and was also a 7UV and 'H NMR ((3 7.91, .s, associated with H-2 and i .,,, d, 265, strong, 296 nm, weak) [4]. The OH was located on C-3' as indicated by its UV spectrum in the presence of NaOAc and NaOH and by the distinctive chemical shift of the acetate on H-6'and H-2'. The 400 MHz 'H NMR spectrum showed additional]> three protons on ring A (H-5. H-6 and H-8 by double irradiation technique). three protons on ring B (H-Z', H-5' and H-6' by the same technique). one methoxyl (6 3.92. .\, 3 H) and one 0-prenylated group (ci 1.79, 1.83. 4.62 and 5.52). The prenyl group was located on the oxygen at position 7 by MS (m,,: = 284, 45 ",,I and by analogy with 1. From these data structure 2 was assigned to this compound and IR, UV. MS and 'H NMR spectra were in accordance. The first component eluted by CC of the oily material analysed for CZi04HZ4, M ! WI, z 388. was named xambioona. Both the 400 MHz 'H NMR (6 2.78.3.02 and 5.36 respectively H-3 cis and H-3 trun.~ to H-2. and H-2. by use of double irradiation technique and coupling constants) and UV spectra (;.,,:,, 227. strong: 315. weak. and inflections at 255 and 268nm) were typical of a flavanone. The 400MHz
dd, .J = 9.0 and J = 2.5 Hz). The presence of two dimethylchromene rings. one on ring A and one on ring B. was supported by MS fragments (W/Z 187 and 171). From these data structure 3 was assigned to xambioona. The absolute stereochemistry is 2s as illustrated because of the similarity of the CD curve in the n, x* and WT* region to that offlavanones ofestablished absolute configuration ;8]. Xambioona was refluxed for 48 hr with base and gave the chalcone 4. The IR, UV, MS and 'H NMR spectra The oily benzene extract was submitted to Si gel CC and were in complete agreement with the structure 4.afforded the flavanone 3 and isoflavone 5.
EXPERIMENTALSeeds of C. mucunoides Desv. were collected from Xambioa region, north Go&, Brazil. The whole, dried, finely pulverized seeds (1.1 kg) were successivelyextrd in a Soxhlet with CsHs and EtOH. After evapn the CsH, extract (96 g) afforded a yellow solid (5.6 g) in mixture with an oily material (90 g). The EtOH extract had free amino acids and was not examined in the present work. The solid C6H6 extract was submitted to Si gel CC and afforded isoflavones 1 and 2 eluted with CHCl,-hexane (1:4) and MeOH-CHCI, (1: 19), respectively. 1 after several purifications by TLC showed a single spot (CHCl,-hexane, 2:3); 50 mg, white needles (hexane), mp 142"; CZ206HZ0.
