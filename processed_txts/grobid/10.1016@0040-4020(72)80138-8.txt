BIOGENETICALLY SIGNIFICANT TRITERPENES IN A SPECIES OF MELIACEAE: CABRQLEA POLYTRICHA A.JUSS
a-Four triterpcnes have been isolated from the fruits of Cabrakn polyrricha A.Juss. (Mehaceae). Two of them are new Cs, compounds whose structures have been established as the C-3, C-24 epimer of ocotillol-II and the C-24 epimer of ocotillone-II: 20s. 24Sepoxydammaranc-3x,25dioi (Ha) and the corresponding 3-keto compound (IVa). The otha two are the synthetically known trisnorlactone of Mills and the corresponding 3a-hydroxy compound (also new), that is, 25,26,27-trisnor-#)~hydroxy-3-oxodammarane-24-ic acid 20,241actone (VII) and 25.26,27-trisnor-3&?0~hydroxydammarane-24-oic acid 20.24htctone (Via).

PLAN-IX or THE FAMILY Meliaceae have been the source of novel triterpenes, especially tetranor-triterpenes (limonoids) and CsO protolimonoids (related to the limonoids by common stereochemistry, but possessing a tetrahydrofuran ring in the side chain instead of a furan).' These compounds apparently are formed by enzymatic oxidation and degradation of the tetracyclic triterpenoid precursor, euphol.Cabralea polytricha A.Juss., family Meliaceae, sub-family Melioideae, is a shrub known in Brazil by the popular name of "'cangerana", a generic denomination for various Cabralea spexies. It is not so well known as Cabralea cangerana Sald., a large tree much employed for timber, whose root bark has widespread use in popular medicine as a panacea against many ills. Cabralea fruits are also reported to have insecticidal properties. To date, the genus Cabralea has received very little chemical attention.Extraction of the fruits of C. polytrich and chromatography on silica gel resulted in the isolation of four triterpenes. not belonging to the limonoid or protolimonoid type. but shown instead to possess the dammarane skeleton. Dammarane triterpenes have previously been isolated from resins of Dipterocarpaceae. roots of Areliaceae and Compositae. and leaves of Betulaceae.2 There is also one known occurrence of a triterpene with this skeleton in the Meliaceae: aglaiol (I) from A&& o&rata3 with a 24,25epoxide, possessing a side chain of intermediate structure between that of dipterocarpol and those of the compounds isolated from Cabralea.
s. C. CASCONThe main component of the fruits of Cabralea polytrich is cabraleadiol (Ha), yield @25"/:, m.p. 175-176", [a]n + 18". IR absorption at 3600 cm-' and 1030-1070 cm-' indicates the presence of OH and ether groups. The NMR spectrum (Table I) shows 8 peaks for quartemary C-Me groups and signals for an equatorial proton (J = 3,3 Hz) under an OH group, and a further proton under an oxygen function, presumably an ether. The mass spectrum presents a molecular ion peak at m/e 460 (C,,H,,Os) with base peak at m/e 143 (CsH1s02), presumably derived from the side chain which could thus include either an hydroxylated tetrahydropyran ring or a tetrahydrofurylisopropanol, similar to that of ocotillol (III).9 The chemistry of IIa (below) suggests an ocotillol side chain, although cabraleadiol is not identical to that triterpene.Cabraleadiol is inert to alkali, acid and LAH, and yields upon acetylation at room temp a monoacetate (IIb) m.p. 148-149", and under vigorous conditions (reflux for several hr) a diacetate, m.p. 129-132" (11~). The monoacetate shows NMR signals  (Table I) for eight quarternary C-Me groups, an acetyl Me, a proton under an AcO group, and the additional proton under the ether, as in cabraleadiol. The diacetate shows corresponding signals (Table I) for 8 quarternary C-Me groups. with two much more deshielded than in the monoacetate, supoorting the presence of a substituted isopropanol group in the sidechain : and for two acetyl Me's, one proton under an AcO group, and the proton under the ether, also somewhat deshielded by the second acetate.The monoacetate cannot be oxidised with Cr03 in pyridine (Sarett's reagent); under the same conditions cabraleadiol yields cabraleone (see following paragraph). Jones' reagent (CrO,/acetone) smoothly oxidises cabraleadiol to Mills' keto-trisnorlactone (VII), strongly supporting structure IIa for the natural diol.Cabraleone (IVa), m.p. 160-161", [z]n + 54", is a lesser component of the fruits (yield 009%). It forms a crystalline oxime and dinitrophenylhydrazone.IR absorption at 36OOcm-' indicates the presence of an OH group. at 1680 cm-' a ketone and at 1050-1100 cm-' an ether linkage. The same eight quarternary C-Me groups as in cabraleadiol appear in the NMR spectrum. along with the multiplet for the proton under the ether.In the mass spectrum the highest detectable peak is at m/e 443, evidently resulting from the loss of 15 units (Me) from m/e 458, the presumed molecular ion (C,,H,,O,). The base peak, as in cabraleadiol. is at m/e 143 (now formulated as a). These data indicate the identity of the sidechain in IIa and IVa. with a 3u (axial)-alcohol in IIa and a 3-keto function in IVa.Cabraleone. like cabraleadiol monoacetate (IIb). is not oxidised by Sarett's reagent. Jones oxidation yields. in like manner, Mills' lactone (VII). Cabraleone may be monoacetylated under forcing conditions.Reduction of cabraleone by LAH gives an isomer (Va) of cabraleadiol which upon acetylation gives a monoacetate (WI). m.p. 171-173", with IR bands at 355.0 cm-' (OH) and 1730 cm-' (OAc). The NMR spectrum shows signals for 8 quartemary C-Me groups and one acetyl Me. The multiplet under the ether is present and unchanged,buttheprotonundertheOHgroupisnowaxial(J = 6,10Hz).Thiscompound was shown to be identical to the monoacetate of the C-24 epimer of ocotillol-II, prepared by Biellmann4 during oxidation of 3-acetyldammarenediol (IX) with pnitroperbenzoic acid. The comparison was made through m.m.p., IR and NMR spectra.By this interrelation, the structure of cabraleadiol is established as the C-3. C-24 epimer of ocotillol-II; cabraleone is the C-24 epimer of ocotillone-II. Recent work' has proven through chemical interrelations and X-ray crystallography that the stereochemistry at C-24 of ocotillol-II is R, with the hydroxyisopropyl at C-24 trans to the Me at C-20. The same work reports a C-24 epimer, the structure of which was established as 24S, that is, with the substituents at C-24 and C-20 in a cis conliguration. Cabraleadiol and cabraleone should have the latter stereochemistry.A third component of the fruits is cabraleahydroxylactone (Via), yield 003%. m.p. 24O-242", [a],, + 24". with IR absorption at 3550 cm-' (OH) and 1760 cm-' (y-lactone). The NMR spectrum (Table I) shows signals for 6 quartemary C-Me groups, with only one downfield of 1 ppm. An additional signal at 3.4 ppm is identical to that corresponding to the 38-proton in the spectrum of cabraleadiol (IIa). The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion at m/e416, corresponding to a trisnor-triterpene. C27H4403. The base peak. at m/e 189. is derived from separation of rings A and B (b).Under mild acetylation conditions, cabraleahydroxylactone forms a monoacetate, the base peak is at m/e 99 (c). These spectral data suggest that cabralealactone is a trisnor-triterpene ketone-y-lactone.As mentioned, the other triterpenes isolated from the fruits of C. polytricha all yield VII upon Jones oxidation, thus interrelating these four compounds. The product, cabralealactone, has spectral characteristics identical to those reported for the ketotrisnor-lactone, first prepared by the CrO, oxidation of dipterocarpol by Mill~.~ Comparison by m.m.ps, IR and NMR spectra showed the two compounds to be identical.For further confirmation, mild NaBH, reduction of VII and subsequent acetylation yielded a compound identical to the 38-acetoxyd ammar-y-lactone VIII, prepared by Biellmann4 through Cr03 oxidation of 3-acetyldammarenediol (IX). Compounds Ha, IVa, Via, and VII have not been previously isolated from natural sources, though VII has been prepared in the laboratory by different oxidation reactions of dipterocarpol and dammarenediol.4~ 6 They apparently represent oxidative degradation products of a normal triterpenoid precursor, which may be the 3-epimer of dammarenediol (unknown to date). Cabraleadiol and cabraleone would be intermediates in the pathway to the further oxidation products, cabraleahydroxylactone and cabralealactone. A model experiment along this lines was performed in vitro by E. H. Warnhoff,' who demonstrated the formation of ocotillol-II (III) as well as its C,, epimer from acetyldammarenediol (IX), by treatment with perphthalic acid. These two epimers are also formed when p-nitroperbenzoic acid is employed instead.4The occurrence in C. polyrricha of dammarane triterpenes, instead of the euphol degradation products normally encountered in the Meliaceae, may be explained by the relatively close chemical relationship of the two groups. For example, it is well known that euphenol and tirucallenol, upon acid treatment in r&o, are rearranged to isoeuphenol and isotirucallenol, with the dammarane carbon skeleton and stereochemistry, a fact which was used by Ruzicka, Jeger and Arigoni' and D. H. R. Barton9 to elucidate the euphol structure. A. Eschenmoser, L. Ruzicka, 0. Jeger e D. Arigoni" assumed that euphol and tirucallol should have a common precursor in uiuo (which would also be the precursor of dammarenediol), formed by a rrans-anti-tram cyclisation of squalene (epoxide) in a chair, chair, chair boat conformation. This cationic tetracyclic triterpene precursor (X), either by a series of concerted or ethylenic intermediate migrations, could attain the euphol or tirucallol structure, differing only in configuration at C-20. Euphol and tirucallol possess a chair-boat conformation in rings B and Cg while dammarenediol, which could arise from direct reaction of the precursor (X) with water at C-20, has the more stable chair conformation in rings A, B and C. EXPERIMENTAL Mps were determined on a Kofler block and are uncorrected. IR spectra were taken as KBr pellets on a Perkin-Elmer Model 12C. NMR spectra were recorded at 60 MHz on Varian T-60 or AdOA instruments or at 100 MHz on a Varian HA-100 instrument, using CDCI, or CQ as solvents.
