DIHYDROISOCOUMARINS AND PHTHALIDE FROM WOOD SAMPLES INFESTED BY FUNGI*
Wood samples, infested by fungi during storage, were shown to contain, besides the known 5-methylmellein, additional (3R)-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-3,4_dihydroisocoumarins substituted by 7-methyl, 5-formyl, 5carboxy, 5-hydroxy, 5-methoxy, 6-methoxy-5-methyl and 6,7-dimethoxy-5-methyl groups, as well as 6-formyl-7hydroxy-5-methoxy-4-methylphthalide.Several 2-methylchromanones were synthesized in order to show that this class of compounds can be distinguished from 3-methyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarins by MS.

INTRODUCTIONThe compounds la-lf, Za, 2b and 3a were isolated from 12 species belonging to 7 families of trees (Table 1). Several 3-methyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarins and phthalides [ 11, as well as 5-hydroxy-2-methylchromanone [23 are typical metabolites of fungi, and, indeed, microscopic examination of wood samples 3,ll and 12, performed by Dr. Ozorio J. M. Fonseca, revealed the presence of Aspergillus, Penirillium, Fusarium and Trickoderma species. Since in freshly cut samples of the same species neither polyketides, nor fungi could be detected, fungal invasion must have taken place during the drying and storage period between collection and extraction. The sites of storage, thousands of kilometers apart for samples belonging to different species (Table l), did not affect the nature of the compounds, which all belong to the same biogenetic group. The introduction of an oxygen function at C-5 presumably through gradual oxidative transformation of Me (cf. la) via CHO (lc), CO,H (ld) to OH (le1 and OMe (If), though unexceptional, is interesting. Small amounts of shikimate-acetate derived compounds were found to co-occur in the extracts of Rkeedia gardneriana [3] mate-acetate derived phenolics, fatty acids (4) and esters (5) as well as sitosterol and stigmasterol (6) and sitostenone (7) were isolated in considerable quantities from all 12 samples (Table 1). Since several hundred wood samples, examined by us over the same period, were kept in the same storage facilities, lack of antibiotic phenolics, accumulation of fatty or steroidal material or both seem to justify fungal invasion.
RESULTSExpansions of the molecular formulae, based on PMR spectra, reveal the compounds to be trisubstituted (la-If), tetrasubstituted (2a) and pentasubstituted (2b, 3a) benzoyl derivatives. The spectra show additionally that the aromatic protons in all trisubstituted derivatives are vicinal and that the hydroxyls in all derivatives are chelated (t ca -1). This fact is confirmed by UV AlCl,shifts. The OCH. Me. CH, units of la-lf, 2a, 2b and the OCH, unit of 3a could, a priori, be part of two pairs of fundamental skeleta, respectively 8 or 9 and 10 or 11. While the phthalide skeleton (10) can be adopted for 3a (Vlll,, 1742 cm-') in preference to the coumaranone alternative (11) which should give rise to a carbonyl band at considerably lower frequency [6], discrimination of chelated dihydroisocoumarins (8) and chromanones (9) is difficult (for both vmsx 1660-1670 cm-').It was necessary to 'measure the carbonyl frequency of the methyl ethers lg and lh (v,, ca 1725 cm-') in order to obtain evidence that these compound are esters (8) and not ketones (9). It was considered that a more reliable distinction between structural types 8 and 9 may be possible by PMR. Clearly, spfitting of the OCHCH, proton bands will be highly sensitive to conformation of  By this criterion, only lb could be a 2-methylchromanone. Its methyl ether lh, however, shows the very different OCHCH, PMR pattern. typical of the methyl either lg and of the natural compounds la, lc-lf, 2a, 2b. Here the oxymethine is represented by a multiplet and the vicinal methylene by two double doublets. Thus, although two types of spectra are indeed obtained, conformational effects for derivatives of an identical skeleton (lb vs lh) may obscure the issue.A further phenomenon which can be attributed to conformation concerns the considerable diamagnetic effect exerted on H-5 (r 3.60) of lb. This, possibly hyperconjugative, effect can be cancelled by modification of the geometry of the heterocycle through interruption of the chelate bridge. Thus, after methylation to lh, the H-5 signal appears at the normal frequency (I. 3.04) expected for aromatic protons para or ortho related to one oxygen function.Less subject to conformational than to constitutional causes, MS should solve the problem at hand. Through retro-Diels-Alder cleavages, the isocoumarins (8) are expected to loose acetaldehyde, whereas the chroma-nones are expected to loose propene. Indeed, while loss of 42 mass units leads to the major and often the base peak of the MS of all synthetic chromanones (13-15) the molecular ion, which gives the base peak in the spectra of most natural compounds of series 1 and 2, looses 44 mass umts. The structural type 8, to which consequently all these natural compounds belong, is characterized by loss of 18 mass units (Table 3) which is an additional distinctive MS feature in comparison with type 9. The 3-methyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarin structure for la was confirmed by NaBH, reduction of its methyl ether lg to 16a, which was characterized by PMR and MS of its diacetate 16b. Mps, UV, IR, PMR [7] and MS, as well as the negative rotations [8] of la and lg, identified la with the known (3R)-8-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarin(5-methylmellein).The evidence concerning the vicinality of its two aromatic protons thus leads to the 7-methylmellein structure for lb. Placement of the substituents at C-5, rather than at C-7, in the formulae for lc-lf and 2a followed three sets of observations:(1) exchange of the Me of la by the CHO of lc causes a 1 ppm paramagnetic shift of the He,-4 PMR signal, and air oxidation of lc gives Id;     Kosterm., Lauraceae) by the lichen Graphinia co&ens Fee (Graphidiaceae) [ 121 identified by Dr. Mason E. Hale Jr. In the second case [3] we were not able, a posteriori, to secure a fresh sample of the extracted plant material (Caruipu costutu Spruce ex Benth., Guttiferae).This was also true for the wood samples 1, 2, 4-10 (Table 1) described in the present paper. The point to be emphasized, nevertheless, is that all plant material must be thoroughly examined for contaminating organisms prior to extraction, if it is desired to avoid uncertainty concerning the origin of the isolated compounds.
EXPERIMENTALIsolation of the compounds. The C,H, extracts of trunk wood samples of the imhcated species (Table 1) were submItted to Si gel column chromatographyThe fractions were purified by TLC on SI gel. Virola uenosa [S]: 3-hydroxy-5-methoxystilbene and virolanol.

and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (12~). Several previously unreported compounds were thus obtained. In the 60 MHz PMR spectra of the 2-methylchromanones 13a, 13b, 13c, 14 and 15 the protons at C-2 were uniformly represented by an apparent sextet (J = 7 Hz) and the protons at C-3 were represented by a doublet (J = 7 Hz). (Slight secondary splitting of peaks, observed in some cases, is not taken into consideration).
(2) le 1s not a catechol and methylation of le gives If; (3) the PMR of 2a shows a -0.3 ppm pyridine Induced solvent shift [9] for the ArH signal, revealing OH/H vicinality, and a 3.0:2.5 height ratio for the OMe/Me peaks, revealing Me/CH, interaction. Placement of the Me rather than other substituents at C-5 in the formulae of 2b and 3a was based on the PMR spectrum of 2b in which the 3.0:2.3 height ratio for the OMe/Me peaks was shifted to 3.0:3.3 by double irradiation at the CHZ frequency and the PMR spectrum of 3a in which the 1.1:3.0:2.0 height ratio for the CH,/OMe/Me peaks was shifted to 2.0:3.0 for CHJOMe by double irradiation at the Me frequency.

DISCUSSION The recent literature reports the occurrences of three further dihydroisocoumarins 2c (6-methoxymellein), 26 and 2e in Kigelia pinnata DC. (Bignoniaceae) [S] and of the phthalide 3b (djalonensin) in Anthocleistu djulonensis A. Chev. (Loganiaceae) [lo]. The stem bark of the latter species is also reported to contain lichexanthone.We have isolated lichexanthone accompanied by physicion twice from higher plants. In the first case [11] the presence of both compounds was subsequently proved to be due to contamination of the plant material (Licuria puchurymajor (Mart.)
