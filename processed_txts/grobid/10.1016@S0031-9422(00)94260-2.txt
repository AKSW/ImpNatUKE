OXOAPORPHINE ALKALOIDS FROM DUGUETIA EXIMIA"
Diels (Annonaceae)was collected near Manaus, AM, and identifed by Dr. W. A. Rodrigues. Voucher INPA, Manaus, 42236. There is no previous work recorded for this species although two aporphines and a (6aS, 7S)-7-hydroxyaporphine (duguetin) were isolated from an unclassified Brazilian Duguetia sp. [2].In the present work the C,H, extract (6g, 0.15 %) of a trunk wood sample was separated by Si gel column and TLC into the following compounds, listed in order of increasing polarity : 2,4,5_trimethoxystyrene (11 mg), sitosterol (40 mg), 0-methylmoschatoline (35 mg) (I a), 11-methoxy-1,2-methylenedioxyox~aprophine (110 mg) (lb) and 11-hydroxy-1,2-methylenedioxyoxoaporphine (10 mg) (1~).The styrene, previously isolated from Pachypodanthium staudtii Eng. et Diels (Annonaceae) [3] and la, previously isolated from Triclisia patens Oliv.[4], T. gilletti Oliv. [S] (Menispermaceae)and Guatteria subsellis (Annonaceae) [6].  this species seems to be somewhat removed from the rest of its genus, and Engler created the monotypic section Mayu to differentiate it from the large sections Mucqueriu and Blackburniu [2].An earlier publication showed that the trunk bark contains the tetrahydrobenzylisoquinoline-derived chelerythrine and magnoflorine, the anthranilic acid-derived canthin-6-one and the furanoquinolines skimmianine, dictamnine and p-fagarine, and an unidentified slightly laevorotatory alkaloid melting at 139-140", apparent MW 273 (MS) [3]. The presence of furanoquinolines, which are lacking in all American species of the Zanthoxylurn/Fuguru complex studied so far with the exception of F. coca [4], Z. belizense [5] and Z. americanurn [6]. indicates a relatively advanced position in the phylogeny of this group [7]. The isolation of the furanocoumarins psoralen. bergapten, xanthotoxin and isopimpinellin from the leaves [S], on the other hand, is not considered significant for the sake of comparison with South American Fuguru species, as several of these which have been shown to contain alkaloids have not been examined for neutral components [9]. The leaves ofFuguru muyu also contain a small amount of alkaloids (0.1 "4). This paper reports the separation and identification of these compounds as skimmianine. (-)-edulinine (I), and ribalinine (2). As mentioned above, skimmianine has been found in the bark [3], where it is accompanied by another two common furanoquinolines which are not present in the leaves. The unidentified bark alkaloid is probably (-)-edulinine, whose MS taken in the usual way shows an extremely faint molecular ion peak and a weak signal at m/e 273 ; the discrepancies in the mp of this compound are probably due to polymorphism.It seems unlikely, given the weakly basic conditions under which the alkaloids were extracted, that (-)-eduhnme IS an artefact. The possibility cannot be ruled out, however, that this substance is formed by the attack of OH-on N-methylplatydesminium and/or the hypo-theticalN-methylribalininiumcation,neitherofwhichhas yet been found in this plant. The apparent lack of optical activity of ribalinine at the sodium D line [IO], should not be taken as an indication that this substance 1s a racemic mixture.To the best of our knowledge, no other member of the ZanthoxylumlFagaru complex has been shown to contain edulinine or ribalinine (or its quarternary precursors, if it should be proved to be an artefact), and the accumulation of these uncommon offshoots of the main biogenetic route to furanoquinoline alkaloids may be ofsome taxonomic significance. In this connection. it should be pointed out that the African species Fuguru chulybeu [l l] and the Puerto Rican Zultthoxylum monophyllum [12] contain angular pyranoquinolones, while F. mayu is the only member of this group which is known to synthesize a linear pyranoquinolone.
EXPERIMENTALAll mps are uncorr. UV, IR and PMR (60 MHz, TMS as int.stand.) spectra were determined in EtOH, KBr and CDCl,. respectively. MS were recorded using electron impact ionization at 70 eV and 200". TLC was carried out on Si gel HF,,, using CHCI, -MeOH (9 : 1).were identifed by comparison of mp, UV, IR. PMR and MS with reported data. The new compounds lb and lc were also charaterized as oxoaporphines by their colour and bathochromic UV shifts in acid solution, as well as by their carbonyl absorptions at 1660cm-' [7]. The molecular formulae C,,H,,O,N (lb) and C,7H904N (lc), determined by elementary analyses and MS, could be expanded, respectively, to C,,H,N.CO.O,CH,.OMe and C,,H,N. CO.O,CH,.OH after inspection of the PMR spectra. Indeed, as was consequently expected, methylation of lc gave an O-methyl derivative which proved to be la R' = R2 = H, R3 = R4 = Me. R' = OMe lb R' = R5 = H. R* = OMe, R3-R4 = CH, lc R' = Rs = H, R2 = OH. R'--R4 = CH, td R' = OMe, RZ = R5 = H. R3-R4 = CH, identical, in all respects, with natural lb. The 6 undefined hydrogens in these compounds cause 3 groups of PMR bands: (i) two doublets (J = 5 Hz) at low field, typical * Part 3 in the series 'The Chemistry of Brazilian Annonaceae'. For Part 2 see ref. [l]. 2a R' = OMe, R* = H 2b R' = H, RZ = OMe of H-5 and H-4 of the isoquinoline system [7], (ii) a singlet and (iii) two double doublets (J = 8.5, 2 Hz) and one triplet (J = 8.5 Hz). Double irradiation experiments, performed on the O-methyl derivative, confirmed the vicinality of two and three protons, indicated respectively by signal groups (3 and (ii). Among the structural alternatives consistent with the coupling constants, lb seemed most consistent with the chemical shift data Indeed, gave (+)-O-methypukateine (Zb) identified by direct comparison (IR and PMR) with an authentic sample, and was thus designated oxo-0-methylpukateine.
