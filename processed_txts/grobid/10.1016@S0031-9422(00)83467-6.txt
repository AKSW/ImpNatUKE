AN ABIETANE DITERPENE FROM THE LABIATE COLEUS BARBATUS
20-Dcoxocarnosol, isolated from the stems of Coleus bmbutus, was shown by chemical and spectral methods to be a new phenolic diterpene with an abietane skeleton. INTRODUCHON As a part of our studies on the cardioactive dichloromethane crude extract of the false boldo, Coleus burbatus Bentham (Labiatae) [l-3], we isolated a new diterpene, 20deoxocarnosol (l), as a crystalline light yellow solid [mp 173.5-175.5"; [a]n = -78.7" (c 1.00, CHCl,); yield: 0.06 % from dry plant material]. I wish to report now on the structure elucidation of 1. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION High resolution mass spectrometry of 1 established the empirical formula C,,H,,O, (316.2056, requires 316.2039). The IR spectrum showed the presence of hydroxyl functions (v, 3560 and 3480cm-') that underwent acetylation to furnish a diacetate 2 devoid of further hydroxyl absorptions in the IR spectrum. IR (v, 1765 cm-') and 'H NMR spectral data (6 2.29 and

2.30, OAc) of 2 suggested the phenolic nature of both hydroxyl groups in 1. The UV spectrum of 1 coniirmed the latter conclusion and indicated that the hydroxyl groups were not paru to each other [4]. The ortho relationship between them came from Ag,O oxidation of 1 into the unstable o-quinone 3 identified by its IR and UV spectra rz51 (v, 1670 and 1650cm-'; 1,222, loga3.76 and 428nm, loge3.28). The pentasubstituted nature of the aromatic ring came from 'H NMR and "C NMR spectral data (lH, br s at 6 6.58; six aromatic carbons 5s and Id, see Table 1). The 'H NMR spectrum of 1 also showed signals for two methyl groups on a quaternary carbon (two 3H, s at 60.86 and 1.14) and for an isopropyl group (6H,d,J = 7 Hz at S 1.25 and 1 H hept, J = 7 Hz at 6 3.16). The small upfield shift (A6 0.24 ppm) of the isopropyl methine signal, observed on acetylation, indicated that the isopropyl group was linked to the phenol moiety. Moreover, the non-equivalence of the isopropyl methyl groups in the 'H NMR spectrum of diacetate 2 (two 3H, d, J = 7 Hz at 6 1.17 and 1.21) suggested that a hydroxyl was probably vicinal to the isopropyl group of 1. These data allowed three different arrangements of the aromatic substituents (A-C). Among them, B could be eliminated since positive Gibbs test [6], and C was discarded mainly on biogenetic grounds since several abietane diterpenes had already been isolated from stems [2,3] and leaves [7-91 of C. barbatus. Fragment A accommodates with an abietane (A,) but also with a sempervirol type compound (AZ). The latter could be discarded since the l/I-H of 1 was found to be deshielded to 6 2.65 due to the 'rabbit-ear effect' [S] of the hydroxyl group at C-11. Additional support for the abietane skeleton was obtained from the ' % NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) which also showed that the third oxygen atom of 1 was part of a -CH-O-CH,-ether moiety (6 71.11,d and 68.48, dd). This was further substanciated by the poorly resolved dd at 6 4.72 ( J = 3.9 and 1SHz) for the H-7 and by the AB quartet observed at 63.08 and 4.31 (1H each, d, J = 9 Hz) attributable to the hydrogens of the oxymethylene moiety. The greater than 1 ppm difference in chemical shifts proved that the latter two hydrogens were in very different environments, and suggested that one hydrogen points towards and the other away from the aromatic ring, a requirement only compatible with the ether being located at C-20. Comparison of the 13C NMR spectral data of the methyl groups of 1, with those of ferruginol (4) [lo, 111 (Table 1) confirmed this assignment. This structure was also supported by the mass spectrum of 1 which was dominated by an ion at m/z286 corresponding to the loss of a CH,O fragment from the molecular ion, and it is known that the fragmentation giving rise to the base peak, in the abietatriene series, is the loss of the C-10 substituent [12]. Furthermore, both the chemical shift and the multiplicity'of the signal at 6 4.72 indicated that the cyclic ether of 1 closed at the C-7 benzylic position. A Dreiding model showed that, in an abietane derivative, any six-membered ring from C-20 to  5) [13,14]. Additional support for the proposed structure was furnished by the large y-gauche effect observed in the "CNMR spectra of 1 and 2 on C-5, shielded by ca 8 ppm, and the important anti-periplanar effect on C-l, shielded by ca 9 ppm from their positions in 4 (Table 1). In turn, C-10 was deshielded by ca 3 ppm. Since compounds 1 and 5 possess identical asymmetric carbons, the molecular rotation of 1 ([a],, = -248.7") strongly supported the proposal that 1 has the same absolute configuration as 5 ([@lo = -249.9") [15], i.e. 1 belongs to the normal series, a conclusion also arrived at from biogenetic considerations [2,3]. It is peculiar to note that, although 20-deoxocarnosol (1) and 6/L hydroxycarnosol(6) [3] are both found in C. barbatus, no carnosol (5) could be detected in this plant.
EXPERIMENTALAll the equipment used for this work has been described previously [2]. 
Isolation of 20_deoxocarnosol(l). Coleus barbatuscreates an a-oriented H-7. This orientation was further confirmed by the coupling constants of the C-7 hydrogen [ 131. Hence, 1 is 7&20-oxidoabieta-8,11,13trien-11,12-diol and it is thus the 20-deoxo derivative of carnosol(
Bentham was collected in the surroundings of Rio de Janeiro during October 1981. Leaves and stems were separated, air-dried, and the stems pulverized in a hammer mill. The stems (1 kg) were extracted successively with hexane, EtOAc and MeOH at room temp. for several days. The hexane crude extract was evaporated under red. pres. to afford a brownish residue (21 g) which was dissolved in MeOH (50 ml). The insoluble material (7 g) was filtered off and the filtrate coned to a vol. of 10 ml. Aliquots of 2 ml were applied on a Sephadex LH-20 column (200ml bed volume) eluted with pure MeOH. 20Deoxocarnosol (1) was eluted from the column together with and several other minor diterpenes. Silica gel column chromatography (eluted with a gradient of EtOAc from 10 to 25% in hexane) afforded 1 still contaminated with
