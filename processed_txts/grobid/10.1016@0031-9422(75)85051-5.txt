A STILBENE AND TWO FLAVANONES FROM
The wood of the vine Derris rar&m (Leguminosae-Lotoideae) contains 3.5dimethoxy-4-prenylstilbene, (2S)-5,7-dihydroxy-6-prenylflavanone and (2S)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-6-prenylflavanone.Den-is rarifbra (Mart.) Macbr. (Leguminosae-Lotoideae), trivial name "timb6-rana", can be found in vast regions of the Amazon valley, from the Guianas, the brazilian States of Para and Amazonas to Peru [2]. The species is not used for fish poisoning and, indeed, TLC examination of extracts of subterranean and aerial parts of this * Part 47 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Legu- minosae".

vine revealed the absence of rotenone. Fractionation of the ethanolic wood extract led to 3 novel compounds, the stilbene (1) and the flavanones (2a) and (2b). The structure of the stilbene derivative, C, ,HZ40Z,, was deduced from its PMR and MS. Oxidation led to benzoic acid, confirming the presence of the phenyl group. The additional aromatic ring must be symmetrically substituted since its 2 aromatic and 6 methoxyl protons give rise to PMR singlets. Double resonance experiments established the lack of coupling between the aromatic and the benzylic methylene protons, eliminating one of the two symmetrical alternatives in'favour of la.The structures of the (2S)-flavanones, CzoHZo04 (2a) and C2 ,HZZ04 (2b), were deduced from ORD, FII.~IO. 0.

Although treatment with acid produced etherification of the C-5 hydroxyl by the side chain. as shown by the IR carbonyl frequency shift (IJ,,,~,~ 1642-1670 cm-' ). this test was not considered conclusive proof for the orrho-position of OH and prenyl groups. In the tlavanone series acid catalyzed rearrangcmcnt could invalidate its significance. Pyridine-induced solvent shifts have been advocated to determine the location of hydrogen or alkyl substituents in the vicinity of phenolic hydroxyls [3]. The quantative conclusions of this work are, however. not applicable to cases in which the hydroxyl can chelate with an adjacent carbonyl. Thus the pyridine shifts for the flavanones (3) and (4). whose preparation [4], separation and identification [S] have been achieved. are very close. respectively -027 ppm (H-6) and -0.22 ppm (H-X)., Absolute resonance values in pyridine. however, arc more significant. While in CDCl, the H-6 and H-8 signals arc very close (2, z 4.04. 4, 7 4.00) in pyridine the H-6 signal appears at lower field (T 3.73) than the H-8 signal (T 3.82). Thus in the pyridine spectrum of 7Gmethylpinocembrin (2~). the 3.73 signal must bc attributed to H-6 and the 3.78 signal to H-X. The pyridine spectrum of the isolate shows ofcourse only one of these signals. Since this occurs at z 3.77, it can be correlated only with H-8. The strong pyridine solvent shift (A -0.21 ppm) of the prenylmethylene resonance is also consistent with the orrho-relationship of the 5-hydroxyl and alkql groups in ring A of 2b. and, consequently. also 2a.
