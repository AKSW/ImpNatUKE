INTRODUCTIONIryanthera grandis Ducke, known as ucu-tiba vermelha, occurs in the central region of the Amazon, in the Madeira and Tapajdz basins [Z]. The epithet of the latin name refers to the size of the fruits, larger than usual for other Myristicaceae. The present paper discloses the presence in these fruits, besides triglycerides (I), of seven compounds, 2a, 2d, 3a and 4a, related with the tocotrienol group of compounds, Sa, a neolignan, 6, a dihydrochalcone, and 7, grandinolide. The last named compound has been described in a previous paper [3]. An additional isolate 8, ethyl oleate, .should be an artifact produced during the fractionation of the extract.
RESULTSCompound 2a was identified with &tocotrienol [4] by spectral means (Table l), as well as transformation into the monoacetate (2b) and the hexahydro-derivative (2c, Tables 2 and3). All 13C NMR peaks (Table 3) were assignable either to the farnesyl moiety (R') (for data on model 9 see [5]) or to the benzopyran moiety (for data on model 2c see [6]). The relative positions of the substituents on the aromatic ring were confirmed by 'H NMR double resonance experiments and by a negative Gibbs test [7].The mass spectrum of 2a (M+ 396, rel. int. 50%) showed peaks suggesting two series of fragments, one involving farnesyl (m/z 205,6 %), geranyl (m/z 137,74 %) and prenyl (m/z 69,100 7") cations, and the other involving 10 as parent cation. The structural proposal for 3a (M+ 790, rel. int. 90%) relied initially on the fact that this compound also generated the indicated series of fragments, together with additional ions of putative structures 3a was an oxidative dimer of 2a. Indeed the IR spectra of both substances were very similar, the hydroxyl band of 3a, however, being less intense. As was to be expected, the latter compound also gave only a monoacetate (3b), besides a dodecahydro-derivative (3c, Table 2). The aromatic region of the 'H NMR spectrum of 3a (Table 1) showed a singlet (66.69) due to an isolated proton, besides two doublets (66.53 and 6.37, both J = 3.0 Hz) due to two meta related protons. The connection of the two units thus involved the oxygen of the hydroxyl of one monomer and an aromatic carbon of the other monomer. A priori both unsubstituted aromatic carbons of 2a may function as bridgeheads in 3a. No protective y-effect, however, was exerted on the relevant aromatic methyl carbon of 3a. The 13C NMR chemical shifts (Table 3) of both aromatic methyls were closely comparable (6 15.9 and 16.2; cf. also 6 16.0 for 2a). Substitution thus could not occur also at the ortho-position of the methyl situated on the pentasubstituted aromatic ring of 3a.The mass spectrum of 2d (M+ 426, rel. int. 22 %) again showed the characteristic series of peaks involving 10 as parent cation. Although the isoprenoidal sequence was restricted to the prenyl (m/z 69, 60%) fragment, the presence of an isoprenyl side chain, even if in modified form, seemed certain. Thus compounds 2a and 2d appeared to have identical skeletons. Comparison of the MWs of both (396 vs. 426) revealed the existence of two hydrogens in the former as against two oxygens in the latter. Indeed, 2d was an a&unsaturated carboxylic acid (1R "In,, 1690 cm-') which was transformed by diazomethane into a methyl ester (2e) and by acetic anhydride into a monoacetate (2f). Catalytic hydrogenation of this acetate led to a hexahydro-derivative (2g, Table 2), in complete agreement with the presence of an isoprenoidal side chain. Prominent mass spectrum fragments of this compound (M + 474,60 %) were 10  As in the preceding compounds Za, 26 and 3a, also in 4a (63.27, d, J = 7.0 Hz). Indeed, catalytic hydrogenation led (M+ 422, rel. int. 8 %) the aromatic ring was substituted by to an octahydro-derivative (4b, Table 2) with only one pair an isoprenoidal side chain. Peaks due to prenyl (m/z 69, of benzylic protons (62.56, t, J = 6.0 Hz). The aromatic 100 %) and geranyl (m/z 137,25 %) appeared in the mass ring of 4a contained an additional benzyl group, repspectrum. In this case, however, the four C,-units formed resented by a two proton signal at relatively low field a geranylgeranyl group, as indicated by 'H NMR signals (63.60, br s), and hence linked also to the butanolide (Table 1) assignable to four olefinic protons (64.9-5.4), carboxyl (IR v,, 1770 cm-'). Finally a phenolic hydrofive vinylic methyls [61.60 (3), 1.66 (l), 1.74 (l)], twelve xyl, demonstrated by the formation of a monoacetate (4c), allylic protons (6 1.9-2.2) and two allylic/benzylic protons must be flanked by two aromatic protons (for the NMR   signal of both A6 C,D,N/CDCl, 0.50 [9]). Since these protons were practically equivalent (for both 66.51, s), they were symmetrically situated also with respect to the other oxy-function and the compound possessed structure 4a.The dihydroxy-4-aryltetralin structure proposed for compound 5a was shown by the formation of a diacetate (5b), as well as on mass, 'H and 13C NMR spectral comparison with known representatives of this series [lo]. The major mass spectrum fragment (m/z 212,69x) was formed by the retro Diels-Alder splitting of the elements of but-Zene. It had to have the two hydroxyls on separate rings on account of the conspicuous hydroxytropylium ion (m/z 107, 18%). The localization of one hydroxyl on the aromatic part of the tetralin system was ascertained through the existence of a m&z-split doublet at relatively very high field (66.2, J = 2.0 Hz) in the 'H NMR spectrum, which could only belong to a perihydrogen protected by a nearby aryl group [l 11. It was to be expected that this aryl would have two protons at C-2 ', 11 (m/z 410,5 %) and 12 (m/z 191,8 x). Thus compound *Part 20 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Myristicaceae".

(m/z 177,29 %) and 13 (m/z 144, 50%). The latter, a McLafferty rearrangement product of 2g, justified the placement of the carboxyl as shown in 2d. All possible 'H NMR double irradiation experiments, as well as spectral comparisons of 2d with 2a and 14 [S] as model compounds (Table l), consubstantiated the validity of the proposed structure 2d.P.
