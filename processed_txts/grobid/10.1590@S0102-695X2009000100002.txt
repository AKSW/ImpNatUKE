Screening of Trypanosoma cruzi glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme inhibitors
RESUMO: "Busca de inibidores da enzima glicossomal gliceraldeído 3-fosfato desidrogenase de Trypanosoma cruzi". Nesse trabalho foi avaliada a atividade inibitória sobre a enzima glicossomal gliceraldeído-3-fosfato desidrogenase de T. cruzi (gGAPDH) de extratos vegetais oriundos de plantas das famílias Meliaceae e Rutaceae, na concentração de 100 mg/mL. Foram testados 46 extratos, dos quais 15 apresentaram atividade inibitória significativa (% AI ≥ 50). A maioria dos extratos de plantas da família Meliaceae (Cedrela fissilis, Cipadessa fruticosa e Trichilia ramalhoi) apresentou grande potencial em inibir a atividade enzimática. O fracionamento do extrato hexânico dos galhos de C. fruticosa permitiu o isolamento de três flavonóides: flavona, 7-metoxiflavona e 3',4',5',5,7-pentametoxiflavona. Os dois últimos foram ativos na inibição da atividade de gGAPDH. Desta forma, as três espécies de Meliaceae testadas podem ser consideradas promissoras na busca de compostos protótipos para o controle da doença de Chagas.

INTRODUCTIONChagas' disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affects some 16-18 million people, mostly from South and Central America, where 25 % of the total population are at risk of contamination (WHO, 2007). Control of the insect vector (Triatoma infestans) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and as consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are the major causes for the spread of the disease (Dias, 1993). Its treatment is still a challenge, since the only drug commercially available (benznidazole) has strong side effects (De Castro, 1993).The bloodstream form of parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae possesses a microbody-like organelle, where glycolysis takes place, the glycosome (Opperdoes & Borst, 1977). The bloodstream form of the parasite T. cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production. This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design (Souza et al., 1998). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) is a glycolytic enzyme which catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BGP). The three dimensional structure of T. cruzi gGAPDH previously determined shows differences, when compared to the homologous human enzyme that could be exploited for selective inhibition (Souza et al., 1998).The need for the development of more efficient drugs against Chagas' disease has stimulated us to initiate a project aiming at the discovery of lead compounds from several plants of Rutales order. In this way, we have proposed the utilization of the glycolytic enzyme gGAPDH as a target for the search of new natural trypanocides (Tomazela et al., 2000;Vieira et al., 2001;Pavão et al., 2002;Moraes et al., 2003). In this paper, we report the gGAPDH inhibition activity of 46 crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants, along with three flavones isolated from an active fraction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Plant materialThe fruits, branches, stems, roots, and leaves of Cedrela fissilis Vell. were collected in 01/06/01 in São Carlos (São Paulo, Brazil)  The voucher numbers and the dates of collection were described in Ambrozin et al. (2004).
Preparation of crude extractsThe powdered air-dried plant material (branches, fruits, leaves, roots, and/or stems) was extracted by maceration three times with hexane, at room temperature for 72 h. This process was repeated with dichloromethane and methanol for C. fissilis and C. fruticosa, and only with methanol for the other species. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and the extracts obtained were assayed on T. cruzi gGAPDH enzyme.
Isolation of compoundsThe hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (12.2 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-dichloromethane-ethyl acetate-methanol gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction (6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with a hexane-dichloromethane-acetone gradient to give 9 fractions. Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using hexane-dichloromethane-acetone (6:3:1), affording 9 fractions. Fraction 5 was three times chromatographed through column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane-dichloromethane-methanol (7:2.5:0.5) to afford compounds 1 (16.7 mg) and 2 (8.2 mg). Fraction 6 was twice submitted to column chromatography with hexane-dichloromethane-methanol (6:3:1) giving compound 3 (30.6 mg). Compounds 1-3 were characterized by comparison of 13 C NMR data with the literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 1975;Passador et al., 1997) and submitted to the enzymatic assay.
Preparation and purification of recombinant T. cruzi gGAPDHTcGAPDH was overexpressed and purified as reported by Souza et al. (1998). It is maintained in the Crystallography Laboratory of the Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil.
T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitory activitygGAPDH activity was determined according to a previously reported procedure (Barbosa & Nakano, 1987;Vieira et al., 2001). Reduced NADH was spectrophotometrically measured at 340 nm during 30 s. The reaction medium contains 50 mmol L -1 Tris-HCl pH 8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L -1 EDTA, 1 mmol L -1 b-mercaptoethanol, 30 mmol L -1 Na 2 HAsO 4 , 2.5 mmol L -1 NAD + , 0.3 mmol L -1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 0.15 mg protein, in a total volume of 500 mL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate. The extracts were tested at a final concentration of 100 mg/mL.
RESULTSIn this work, we evaluated the inhibitory activity of 46 extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on T. cruzi gGAPDH enzyme (Table 1). Fifteen of them showed high ability in inhibit the enzyme (IA % > 50) at 100 mg/mL.
Screening of Trypanosoma cruzi glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme inhibitorsThe hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFGH) and the methanol extracts from Meliaceae plants were the most active ones, whereas the extracts from Rutaceae did not present significant results.The investigation of the ethyl acetate fraction (inhibitory activity = 81.9 % at 100 mg/ mL) from the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFGH) led to the isolation of three flavonoids: flavone (1), 7-methoxyflavone (2) and 3',4',5',5,7-pentamethoxyflavone (3). The flavones 1 and 2 were assayed (Table 2) and the results showed that only 2 presented high inhibitory activity against gGAPDH enzyme.
DISCUSSIONThe results indicated that, among the assayed species, C. fissilis, C. fruticosa and Trichilia ramalhoi are promising sources of lead compounds for the rational design of new trypanocidal drugs. The inhibitory activity of the flavones 1 and 2 against gGAPDH has been reported for the first time. Recently, Ambrozin et al. (2004) published their activity against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi and Tadesmir et al. ( 2006) described the trypanocidal activity of some flavones. A previous study showed that compound 3 completely inhibited the gGAPDH activity at 268.8 mmol/L (Tomazela et al., 2000). Thus, the activity of the studied extract (CFGH) (Table 1) is probably related to the presence of the active flavones 2 and 3. However, their enzymatic activity were considered weak, particularly in comparison with chalepin, a coumarin isolated from Pilocarpus spicatus (Rutaceae), which reduced the gGAPDH activity by 75 % at 93 mmol/L (IC 50 = 64 mmol/L) (Vieira et al., 2001;Pavão et al., 2002;Menezes et al., 2003;Moraes et al., 2003;Leitão et al., 2004).Similar studies involving the enzyme gGAPDH have been reported by our group. Vieira et al. (2001) showed the enzymatic activity of several plants of Rutaceae and Meliaceae families and thirteen coumarins isolated from different species, which are considered as one of the most promising class of substances with gGAPDH inhibitory activity. Moreover, the gGAPDH activity of several flavonoids isolated from Meliaceae, Rutaceae and Leguminosae plants, including pyrano chalcones, flavones, flavanones, flavonols and isoflavones, have also been reported (Tomazela et al., 2000;Moraes et al., 2003). Recently, Januário et al. (2005) described the activity of 7-hydroxy-4',6-dimethoxyisoflavone on gGAPDH. All these data support the hypothesis that highly oxygenated flavones possess the structural requirements to inhibit gGAPDH.The family Meliaceae is characterized by the frequent occurrence of limonoids (da Silva et al., 1984). This class of compounds has been attracted considerable interest because of their biological properties and diversity of structures (Champagne et al., 1992).Previous studies of C. fissilis showed the isolation of limonoids and triterpenes (Taylor, 1984;Zelnik, 1966Zelnik, , 1970;;Leite et al., 2005a;Ambrozin et al., 2006) and C. fruticosa has been reported to contain ent-clerodanes and labdanes diterpenoids (Rojatkar and Nagasampagi, 1994;Rojatkar et al., 1994), limonoids, steroids, sesquiterpenoids, heneicosene derivatives and one coumarin (Luo et al., 2000(Luo et al., , 2001;;Leite et al., 2005a,b). There are no phytochemical studies about T. ramalhoi, but several compounds have been isolated from the Trichilia genus, such as, limonoids (Cortez et al., 1992;Garcez et al., 1997;Garcez, et al., 2000;Cortez et al., 2000), lignan glycosides (Cortez et al., 1998), w-phenyl alkanoic and alkenoic acids (Pupo et al., 1996), terpenoids, steroids (Pupo et al., 2002;Pupo et al., 1996) and g-lactones (Pupo et al., 1998). Phytochemical studies with other active extracts from these plants are in progress and shall reveal molecules that can be used as potential lead compounds in the search for potent and selective T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitors.In conclusion, most of the active extracts belong to the family Meliaceae. New investigations with these extracts are undertaken in order to find inhibitors that could act as potential lead molecules on the described assay. Moreover, the isolated flavonoids bring about the enzymatic inhibition, showing that these compounds are potential lead molecules for the development of new drugs against Chagas' disease.
