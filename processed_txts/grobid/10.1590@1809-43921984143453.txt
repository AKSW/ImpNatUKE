THE CHEMISTRY OF BRAZILIAN LEGUMINOSAE. LXI. (+)-METHYL VOUACAPENATE FROM VOUACAPOUA PALLID IOR
The wood o{j Vouacapoua ραΙΙίχϋοΛ.  contaA.no ( + )-meXhul vouacapznate..

The genus Vouacapoua Aubl. (family Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae) comprises three arboreous species found in tropical South America where they are popularly known under the collective designation "acapu". Their wood is of great durability and has been ex ploited in Construction, mostly of flooring and furniture, for so many years that the trees are nearing extinction (Rizzini ε Mors, 1976).V. americana Aubl. and V. macropetala Sandw. have been examined previously with respect to thei r chemica 1 const i tuents. Wood samples of both species were found to contaiη (+)-methyl vouacapenate (Sploelstra, 1930;King et al., 1955). In continuation of our work on the chemistry of Leguminosae (for Part LX see Dias et al., 1982), we wish to re port that the trunk wood of V.pallidior Ducke also contains a substantial quantity of the same compound. Methyl vouacapenate is also accesscible through total synthesis (Spencer et al., 1971).
EXPERIMENTALTrunk wood of V.pallidior (voucher INPA herbarium 58-612) was collected at the IR and 1 H NMR spectra identical with the analogous published spectra (Spencer et al. , 1971).The benzene solution was evaporated and the residue (0.9 g) was chromatographed on a silica (10 g) column. Elution with benzene gave fatty material; and elution with benzene -chloroform 1.1 and chloroform gave fatty material plus sitosterol. All fractions contained small proportions of methyl vouacapenate. The chloroform solution was evaporated and the residue (0.8 g) was chromatographed on a silica (10 g) column.  2667, 2564,2299, 1718max (broad), 1642, 1465, 1449, 1434, I4l8, 1391, 1299, 1233, 1205, 1157, 1099, 1058, 1026, 990, 975, 962, 939, 879, 853, 828, 769.

The solution was evaporated and the residue (18 g) was washed sue cessively with light petrol, benzene and chloroform.
