FURTHER FARNESYL-HOMOGENTISIC ACID DERIVATIVES FROM OTOBA PARVIFOLIA*
seeds of Otoba paruifolia contain three novel compounds apparently derived from homogentisic acid, reI-(l'R,5'R)-2-(1'-farnesyl-5'-hydroxy-~-oxocyclohex-3'-en-l'-yl)-acetic acid and its acetate as well as rel-(l'R,4'S,SR)-2-( l'-farnesyl-4',5'-dihydroxy-2'-oxocyclohexan-l'-yl)-acetic acid d-lactone. The structure of an additional isolate, previously described as 2-( l'-farnesyl-2'-hydroxy-S-oxocyclohex-3'-en-1'-yl)-acetic acid y-lactone was revised to rel-(l'R,S'R)-2-(l'-farnesyl-S-hydroxy-2'-oxocyclohex-3'-en-l'-yl)-acetic acid d-lactone.

INTRODUCTION
RESULTSFruit kernels of Otoba paruijolia (Mkfg.) A. Gentry from the Amazon region have been reported to contain, besides sitosterol and the furofuran lignans xanthoxylol and philygenol, some homogentisic acid (1) derived compounds, attributed to structures 2, 3a, 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b [2]. Re-examination of the same material revealed the additional presence of three further compounds, 6a, 6b and 7a. Fruit pericarp was found to contain sitosterol, nerolidol, the neolignan hydroxyotobain [3], the furofuran lignans xanthoxylol and forsythigenol [4], as well as 6b. Meanwhile, in the quest of a model for 3a, compound 3b was synthesized [S]. The spectral data for the synthetic product (IR,,, 1780 and 1686 cm-') and the natural isolate (IR,,, 1742 and 1683 cm-') were significantly different (see also Tables l-3). Thus, the present work required not only the structural determination of the novel isolates 6a, 6b and 7a, but also the structural revision of 3a, now designated 8.The 'H (Tables 1 and2) and 13C (Table 3) NMR spectra in combination with low resolution mass spectral molecular weight determinations (Table 4) established the formulae C,,H,,O, (6c), Cz6H3s05 (6d) (the respective methyl esters of 6s and 6b) and C,,H,,O,

Fa (7a) (Fa = farnesyl) and led to the conclusion that all three must be closely related to the co-occurring known compound CsH,O,. Fa (8 = 7a-H,O).Indeed the mass spectra of all four compounds are closely comparable (Table 4). IR spectral comparisons showed the 6lactone of 7a (I$:: 1741 cm-'), though present in 8 (vi: 1742 cm-'), to be replaced by an ester in 6e and 6d (vZaT 1732 f 1 cm-'); and the a&unsaturated carbonyl of 8 (vale 1683 cm-'), though present in 6c and 6d (vale 1679 f 2 cm-'), to be replaced by a saturated carbonyl in 7a (~2: ca 1712 cm-'). Hydrolysis of the lactone of 8 would generate a hydroxyl at a trisubstituted C-5' as shown in 6e. Acetylation of this hydroxyl is expected to cause an ca 1 ppm paramagnetic shift of the carbinolic proton signal and ca 4    $This is probably an average coupling constant (a small A6 between the two H-6 results in this second-order effect).Farnesyl-homogentisic acid derivatives from Otobn paruijiilia '5  [2]. tSignals within the same column may be interchanged.  2). With respect to position l', it is the farnesyl substituent which is axial. Only in this case, one of the acetic acid methylene protons lies in the plane of the ring carbonyl, as documented by the corresponding NMR signal an extraordinarily low field (62.9). No CH=CHCO signals appear in the spectra of 7a where the ketone carbonyl is flanked by a methylene and a quaternary carbon. This locates the hydroxyl, jointly with a sole proton (63.93), at C-4'. In contradistinction such an r&unsaturated carbonyl appears again in the additional B-lactone 8. The rings in both compounds, 7a and 8, must be c&-fused. Hence, only the orientation of the free hydroxyl in 7a remains to be established. This is equatorial. Indeed only for this conformation, but not for the antipodal orientation shown in the model 7b, observed and calculated vicinal coupling constants are compatible (Table 2).
DISCUSSIONThe co-occurrence in 0. ppm paramagnetic shifts of the C-4' and C-6' signals. These are precisely the relevant 'H and 13C NMR spectral modifications upon passing from 6e to 6d, all other features remaining closely comparable. The hydroxyls in 6c and 6d are both a-oriented. Indeed, only for this conformation, but not for the antipodal orientation shown in the model 6e, observed and *Part 38 in the series 'The Chemistry of Brazilian Myristicaceae'. For Part 37 see ref.
