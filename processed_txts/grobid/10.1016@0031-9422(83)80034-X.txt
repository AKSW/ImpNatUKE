SIX DITERPENES FROM VELLOZIA COMPACTA
Vellozia compacta contains six new diterpenes of the pimarane type. Their structures were deduced on the basis of spectral data and chemical modification.

INTRODUCTIONThe Velloziaceae constitute one of the most interesting plant families occurring in South America and Africa. The family contains ca 250 species of perennial herbs and shrubs, of which the genus Vellozia Vand. contains ca 140 species [ 11. These plants are found in rocky regions on dry soil. They are ligneous, rooted superficially to the soil and they grow very slowly. In spite of their apparent fragility they attain a surprising longevity. This may be partly due to the terpenes which are present in large quantities in these plants and which might act as chemical defence against predators [2].
gf!-' o&k0As part of our programme on systematic phytochemical investigation of Brazilian Velloziaceae, we wish to report on the study of Vellozia compacta Martius ex Schultes, a perennial species widely distributed in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe hexane extract of roots, stem and leaf sheaths of V. compacta yielded a series of new diterpenes of the pimarane type besides compactone (1) and one diterpene with a cleisthantane skeleton (2). Substances 1 and 2 were discussed in our previous works [3,4]. Characterization of the new pimarane type substances (3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8) is reported in this paper.In accordance with their substitution pattern, the compounds listed can be divided into three groups.
Group IThe spectral data of compactol (3) suggested two hydroxyl, one vinyl and four tertiary methyl groups. This information, together with the molecular formula, CzoH3,02, obtained from the high resolution mass spectrum suggested that 3 could be a diterpenoid of the pimarane type, similar to those found in this family during our previous studies [3].A carbinol methine signal at 6 3.24 (1 H, dd, J = 9 and 5 Hz) accounted for a secondary hydroxyl group. The multiplicity of the signal of the CHOH proton demonstrates that it is flanked by two hydrogens and, from its coupling constants, an axial orientation could be assigned to it. Consequently, the hydroxyl group is equatorial. Similar results were obtained when 3 was oxidized by either PCC or PCD [5].
/ --\ \ & \A confirmation of structure 3 by oxidation into compactone ( 1 The 13C NMR spectrum of 4 confirmed its structure with the carbon resonances being in agreement with a 7P,Sfl-dihydroxypimarane possessing a hydroxymethyl group at the C-18 equatorial position. This was deduced from the chemical shifts of Me-l 9 and C-S (fi 18.2 and 46.0, respectively [6]).
Group IIThe unsaturated compounds of this group comprise two cx&unsaturated pimarane ketones. The molecular formula of 12,0-hydroxy-7-oxopimar-8(9),15-dien (5). CZOH300Z, was determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. The IR spectrum revealed the presence of a conjugated ketone (1645 cm-'), hydroxyl (3480 cm-') and vinyl (3080 and 910 cm-') groups. The UV confirmed the x,/1unsaturated carbonyl group [i. Fz" 252 nm (log E 4.15)].The 'H NMR spectrum, in deuterochloroform showed signals for four tertiary methyl groups (d 0.90, 0.95, 0.99 and 1.14), one tertiary vinyl c5.05 (IH, dd, J = 18 and 1.5 Hz), 5.09 (lH,dd.J = lOand 1.5 Hz)and 5.72 (lH,dd, J = 18 and 10 Hz)] group and one carbinolic proton 6 3.66 (lH, t, J = 6 Hz). The multiplicity of the carbinolic proton signal and the magnitude of its coupling constants suggested that the hydroxyl group is pseudo-equatorial. The stereochemistry of the hydroxyl at C-12 was confirmed by the high field position of the methyl group at C-17 (6 19.8). The shielding was attributed to the strong ygauche effect of the hydroxyl group (Table 1) [7].The UV, IR and 'H NMR spectra of 1 la-hydroxy-7oxopimar-X( 9),15-dien (6) were similar to those of 5. A carbinol methine signal at 64.60 indicated a secondary hydroxyl group. The low yield position of the carbinolic proton of 6 suggested that the CH_OH proton might be allylic [S]. The interrelation between the secondary hydroxyl group and ethylenic linkage was derived by oxidation of 6 with PCC. The product, 7.1 l-dioxopimar-8( 9),15-diene (7), exhibited, in the UV, an absorption at 2 :a;" 264 nm (log E 3.93) for an enedione [9].The stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group at C-l 1 was deduced from the 'H NMR spectrum of 6 in deuteropyridine. The methyl group at C-20 suffered a downfield shift of b 0.23 on changing from deuterochloroform to pyridine solution, which establishes its syndiaxial relationship with the hydroxyl group   17 24.9 q 24.3 24.7 q q 19.8 q 28.1 q 26.4 q 18.2 q 18 33.0 q 33.4 71.

The IR spectrum of this compound showed a broad absorption in the region 3420--2950 cm ' and a carbonyl band at 1730 cm-'. strongly suggesting the presence of a carboxyl group. Chemical confirmation of this assumption was obtained by methylation (CH,N,) leading to 10, which showed, in the IR, absorptions for two carbonyl groups (1740 and 17 12 cm-'). The mass spectrum of 10 presented the molecular ion at m/z 334 and an intense peak at mjz 138 resulting from McLafferty rearrangement involving the keto group and probably the hydrogen at C-5.
) failed. Reduction of 1 with sodium borohydride in methanol yielded an epimeric mixture of alcohols (2: 1) in which compactol (3) was the one major isolated. Compactotriol (4) was obtained as colourless prisms, and shown to have the formula C,,H,,O,. The IR spectrum showed a broad peak at 3350 cm ' (OH), it also exhibited a vinyl band at 905cm--'. The 'H NMR spectrum in pyridine-d, was very similar to that of compactol (3) except for the presence of a pair of doublets centred at (S 3.10 (1H. J = 1 I Hz) and 3.44 (1 H, .I = 11 Hz). due to the CH,OH of C-18.
