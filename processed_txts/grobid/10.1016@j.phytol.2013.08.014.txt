Microbial transformation of b-lapachone to its glycosides by Cunninghamella elegans ATCC 10028b
Introductionb-lapachone (1) (Fig. 1), an ortho-naphthoquinone found as a minor constituent in the heartwood of the Tabebuia species (Silva et al., 2003), can also be synthetically produced from precursors such as lapachol (Claessens et al., 2010). This naphthoquinone remains to be a promising anticancer agent and has been included in clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs (Miao et al., 2009). Several studies report the pharmacological activity of this molecule against different cancer cell lines and highlighted the great potential for its application (D'anneo et al., 2020;Moon et al., 2010;Dong et al., 2010;Park et al., 2011). Although numerous synthetic studies have been carried out on b-lapachone, there are no previous studies involving the microbial transformation of this naphthoquinone. This approach may contribute to a better understanding of human metabolism of b-lapachone and to produce new derivatives.Microbial transformation has been used as a useful tool for in vitro drug metabolism studies (Borges et al., 2007). Furthermore, microorganisms can provide better yields of the metabolites when compared with in vivo metabolism studies, producing enough material for toxicological and biological assays (Adelin et al., 2012;Yang et al., 2012).Fungi of the genus Cunninghamella stand out amongst other genera because can catalyze reactions mimicking the mammalian metabolism (Asha and Vidyavathi, 2009). Cunninghamella species are capable of metabolizing a wide variety of xenobiotics using both phase I and phase II reactions (Zhang et al., 1996;Abourashed et al., 2012), oftentimes giving rise to new compounds (Feng et al., 2012;Yang et al., 2013).Reactions of phase II of b-lapachone were described in a study of in vivo metabolism with mammalians, including humans. It was reported that in human metabolism are formed conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate, as well as an unexpected glucosylsulfate conjugate (Savage et al., 2008). In other studies using in vitro metabolism in cryopreserved hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs and humans and in human liver and intestinal S9 fractions, blapachone was preferably conjugated with glucuronic acid. These derivatives of b-lapachone were identified by mass spectrometry (Miao et al., 2009;Chen et al., 2012) as well as an o-methylated metabolite of b-lapachone that was found in rat and human liver microsomes (Lee et al., 2013). In red blood cells, metabolic pathways involved bond cleavage on the B-ring (Miao et al., 2008).The correlation between reactions catalyzed by fungi and human is not trivial. Nevertheless, in this case, on the human

Cunninghamella elegansA B S T R A C T b-lapachone (1) has entered phases I and II clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors and the therapeutic efficacy of b-lapachone is closely related to its metabolic process. In order to contribute to a better understanding of human metabolism of b-lapachone, Cunninghamella elegans ATCC 10028b was used as a microbial model of mammalian metabolism to biotransform b-lapachone and two new glycosylated derivatives were produced. The chemical structures were elucidated as 6-hydroxy-2,2- 3) by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, HMBC, HMQC, COSY and HRMS analyses. The major derivative (3) displayed a lower activity against breast cancer cell line SKBR-3 (IC 50 = 312.5 mM) than b-lapachone (IC 50 = 5.6 mM), but did not show cytotoxicity against normal fibroblasts cell line GM07492-A, whereas b-lapachone was highly toxic (IC 50 = 7.25 mM). These metabolites were reported here for the first time and are similar to those that This report describes for the first time the production of blapachone glycosylated derivatives, which were obtained by microbial transformation using Cunninghamella elegans ATCC 10028b.dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-5-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (2) and 5-hydroxy-2,2-di- methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-6-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (
Results and discussion
Identification of metabolitesThe transformation of b-lapachone by C. elegans furnished two major glycosylated derivatives that had not been described in the literature before, which were identified as the regioisomers 6- and the expected correlations (Ferreira et al., 2009;Claessens et al., 2010). Also, the three signals of (C-1 0 ), 75.4 (C-2 0 ), 77.9 (C-3 0 ), 71.0 (C-4 0 ), 78.2 (C-5 0 ), and 62.2 (C-6 0 ) in the 13 C NMR spectrum (Table 1).  (1)hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-5- O-b-D-glucopyranoside (2) and 5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-3,4- dihydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-6-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (3) (Fig(2) (3)  
Mycelium analysisThe two new glycosylated derivatives 2 and 3, as well as blapachone were detected in the extracts from mycelium (see supplementary data). The derivatives may be produced in the intracellular environment once b-lapachone was also detected or the cells may be retained the products and the substrate. This explains the low yields obtained from this biotransformation procedure determined only considering the culture broth.
Cytotoxic assayIn this study, cell cytotoxicity assays were carried out with blapachone (1) and its major metabolite (3) on breast cancer cell line SKBR-3 and normal fibroblasts cell line GM07492-A. Doxorubicin was used as the positive control. The major derivative (3) was much less potent against breast cancer cell line SKBR-3(IC 50 = 312.5 mM) than b-lapachone (IC 50 = 5.6 mM), which was also less potent than doxorubicin (IC 50 = 0.45 mM). Compound 3 did not show cytotoxicity against normal fibroblasts cell line GM07492-A (IC 50 > 1000 mM), whereas b-lapachone was highly toxic (IC 50 = 7.25 mM), as well as doxorubicin (IC 50 = 7.0 mM).It is well known that naphthoquinones have particular chemical structure capable of inducing oxidative stress. This ability to act as oxidizing agents may explain some of the toxic and pharmacological activities attributed to these compounds (Pinto and Castro, 2009). Plenty of studies have been reported the correlation between quinone cytotoxic activity and high levels of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) expression (Siegel et al., 2012). The NQO1 is overexpressed in breast cancer cells (Siegel and Ross, 2000).Glycosylation of natural products has emerged as a viable strategy to produce bioactive compounds with improved activity (Gantt et al., 2011). Regarding naphthoquinone glycosylation, there are few reports on structure-activity relationships (SAR) and only one in which the study of antileukemic effects and SAR were performed. The evaluation of O-or S-glycosylated derivatives of juglone concluded that these compounds have potential for new antileukemic agents development (Fedorov et al., 2011).Even though many b-lapachone derivatives have been synthesized, it is the first time that a b-lapachone glycosylated derivative was produced and evaluated against normal and cancer cell lines. Important anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, contain sugars attached to the aglycone core and this portion of the molecule usually participates in the interaction between the drug and the cellular target. The planar aromatic portion of the doxorubicin molecule intercalates between two base pairs of the DNA, while the six-membered daunosamine sugar sits in the minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to the intercalation site, as evidenced by several crystal structures (Gao and Wang, 1995). The results of this study revealed that in the case of b-lapachone the addition of a b-D-glucose moiety reduced the cytotoxic activity against cancer cell line SKBR-3. On the other hand, the glycosylated derivative did not show cytotoxicity against normal fibroblasts, which is an improvement of selectivity, and this information can be valuable for the development of rational approaches to achieving changes in selectivity and to predict individual variability of b-lapachone efficacy, since C. elegans may possess metabolic enzymes similar to mammals.
Materials and methods
General experimental proceduresOptical rotations were measured in CH 3 CN with a JASCO Dip-370 digital polarimeter. A Shimadzu model IRPrestige-21 spectrophotometer was used to obtain the IR spectra, and an Agilent HP 8454-G1103A spectrophotometer was used to record the UV spectra. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, including one-dimensional, 1 H and 13 C, and two-dimensional NMR techniques, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC) and correlation spectroscopy (COSY), were recorded in CD 3 OD with a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz for 1 H and 125 MHz for 13 C NMR using residual CD 3 OD resonances as internal reference. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of all compounds are provided in the Supplementary data.HPLC analyses of biotransformation and control extracts were performed on a Shimadzu SCL-10Avp multisolvent delivery system equipped with a Shimadzu SPDM10Avp photodiode array detector, using a phenyl analytical column (Phenomenex Synergi Polar 4 mm, 80 A ˚, 150 mm Â 4.6 mm) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min using 10-100% acetonitrile in water over 33 min and an Intel Celeron computer utilizing CLASS-VP software for analytical system control, data collection and processing. The spectral data from the detector were collected over the 200-400 nm range of the absorption spectrum.Preparative HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu CBM-20A system equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-20A UV/VIS detector, using a phenyl semi-preparative column (Phenomenex Synergi Polar 4 mm, 250 mm Â 10 mm) with a flow rate of 3.0 mL/min, utilizing LCSolution software version 1.1. The mobile phase used for separation of metabolites in preparative scale consisted of a steady gradient starting at 50% acetonitrile in water, rising to 65% acetonitrile in water over 20 min and reaching 100% acetonitrile in 30 min.High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS and HRMS/MS) were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics micrOTOF II-ESI-TOF operating in the positive ion mode. The samples were diluted in acetonitrile and water (1:1, v/v) at a concentration of 0.02 mg/mL. Accurate mass measurements were achieved using TFA-Na + (sodiated trifluoroacetic acid) as standard for internal calibration on electrospray ionization time of flight (ESI-TOF).
Chemicalsb-Lapachone was obtained by heterocyclization from lapachol, according to classical semisynthetic procedure (Hooker, 1892). Lapachol was purchased commercially (Sigma-Aldrich). C. elegans was grown in a three-step culture procedure. The fungus was first grown at 30 8C in Petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar medium (Himedia) for seven days. Then, three agarmycelium discs of approximately 6 mm in diameter were transferred for 13 Â 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, each holding 50 mL of potato dextrose broth medium (Acumedia) on a rotary shaker operating at 120 rpm at 30 8C for six days. The resulting mycelia were harvested, rinsed and transferred to 13Â 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, each holding 100 mL of Czapek modified medium (glucose 1.0%, NaNO 3 0.2%, K 2 HPO 4 0.1%, MgSO 4 Á7H 2 O 0.05%, KCl 0.05% and FeSO 4 Á7H 2 O 0.001%). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0. The substrate (1, 5 mg) was added to each flask as a solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (5.0 mg/mL). Control flasks consisted of culture medium with fungus and dimethyl sulfoxide without b-lapachone, and culture medium with b-lapachone solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide without fungus. Biotransformation experiments were carried out at 30 8C for 168 h with shaking at 120 rpm. After, the mycelia were separated by filtration and the fermentation broths were combined and extracted three times with ethyl acetate and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to yield a crude extract (88 mg).The crude extract (88 mg) was submitted to a solid-phase extraction clean-up procedure using C18-E cartridge (J.T. Baker) and elution of acetonitrile and water, starting with 100% water and reaching 100% acetonitrile. The eluate was evaporated to dryness, and the fractions of 40% (6 mg) and 50% (17 mg) of acetonitrile were dissolved with acetonitrile and water (1:1, v/v), and submitted to a semi-preparative HPLC to give: (2) 6-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-3,4- dihydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-5-O-b-D
Mycelium analysisThe mycelia from biotransformation and control experiments were kept in freezer for 24 h followed by crushing and extraction with ethyl acetate. After 24 h in the organic solvent at room temperature the mixtures were filtered and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The extracts were analyzed by analytical HPLC (Section 3.1).
Cytotoxicity assayThe cytotoxic activity was evaluated using the neoplastic cell line SKBR-3 derived from human breast cancer and obtained from Cell Bank of Rio de Janeiro (RJ, Brazil), and normal human fibroblast cell line GM07492-A (Coriell Cell Repositories, USA). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and seeded in 96-well plate at a concentration of 4 Â 10 4 cells/well in DEMEM medium with HAM-F10 (1:1, v/v) (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). After 24 h incubation at 37 8C (CO 2 , 5%), the cell cultures were treated with different concentrations of b-lapachone and its derivative (3), dissolved in DMSO (1%) in concentrations ranging 50-400 mM, and incubated again for 24 h. Then, cell viability was assessed using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. Doxorubicin 4 mM was used as positive control. The tests were performed in duplicate and repeated three times. Results were analyzed using the GraphPad Sigma (3.1) and IC 50 values were calculated from the mean values of data from three wells. The IC 50 value, i.e., the concentration required to inhibit 50% of proliferation was determined by the linear regression model using GraphPad Prism 1 5.0 (California, USA).occur in phase II of human metabolism ß 2013 Phytochemical Society of Europe.
