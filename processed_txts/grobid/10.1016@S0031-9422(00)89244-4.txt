INTRODUCTIONIn a previous paper on an Aniba sp. (Lauraceae), the occurrence of the 9 benzofuranoid neolignans la, lc, lf, 2a. &I, 3a, 3h, 4d and 4f was described. Inspection of their structures and interconversions by pyrolysis led to the postulate that these compounds belong to series whose representatives can be linked by sequential Cope, retro-Claisen and Claisen rearrangements, e.g. la + 2a -+ 3a, 2d + 4d, If + 4f, and that, consequently, the missing links &I, 2f and 3f, as well as a precursor of 3b, should occur naturally [2].One of the objectives of the present re-investigation thus concerned the isolation and description of such compounds. A new examination of the species was desirable anyway, since in the original paper the absolute stereochemistry at C-2 and C-3 had been established with certainty only for the 2,3-truns-dihydrobenzofuranoids la, 2a, 2d, 3a, 3b and 4d [2]. The relative configuration of the C-3 vicinal chiral centers in compounds of type 1 was since deduced by i3C NMR [3], and thus the absolute stereochemistry of la is now known. The technique proved of no help, however, in the analysis of the chirality at C-5 of compounds of type 2, and this feature, aa well as the absolute stereochemistry of the 2,3-cis-dihydrobenzofuranoids lc, If and 4f, remained to be investigated PHYTO 16/6--H
RESULTS
Structural determinationsBotanical material of the previously studied [2], as well as of three additional specimens, was tentatively classified by Dr. K Kubitzki, Hamburg, as belonging to Aniba simulans Allen Separate work-up revealed the presence in all trunk wood C,H, extracts of sitosterol, benzyl benzoate and henzyl salicylate, common constituents of Aniba species [4], and 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin, recently isolated from another Lauraceae species [l]. The distribution of 14 neolignans (Table 1) shows that the chemical composition of specimens numbered 42 237 [2], 46 7% and 46 800 can be considered identical, six of their neolignans bearing a 3,4,5_trimethoxyphenyl and 5 a 3-methoxy4,5-methylenedioxyphenyl substituent The composition of a specimen 46 798 is peculiar, in so far as all six isolated compounds bear a 3-methoxy-4,5_methylenedioxyphenyl substituent.Thus, the present work led indeed to the expected intermediates (34 2f and 3Q and precursor (2b). Compound 5 was obtained concommitantly.Since it was observed, however, that 4f (but not 4d) decomposed into 5 during silica gel TLC, the natural occurrence of this benzofuran derivative is not assured. The constitutions of these five compounds were    The proposed structures were confirmed by synthesis. This involved precursors of established structure [2], which were subjected to pyrolysis (2d + 3d, If + 2f -+ 3f + 4f. 8) or air oxidation (4f -P 5). The Cope rearrangement of If + 2f is of special significance. Indeed, since the relative configuration of If is known [3] and the thermal reaction operates by suprafacial ally1 migration, the relative configuration of the product can only be expressed as in 2f.In additional interconversions, acid isomerization of 31 and 4f (negative Cotton effects at 290 nm) led, as expected, respectively to 3d and 4d (positive Cotton effects at 290 nm). Clearly, this reaction proceeds by epimerization only of C-2. Absolute configurations can thus be formulated not only for 3f and 4f, but also for the additional 2,3-cis-derivatives If and 2f, on account of the aforementioned conversion to 3f, and for lc, whose ORD curve is superimposable on the analogous curve of If.Deduction of the absolute configuration of 2a, 2b and 2d will be part of a forthcoming general discussion on the stereochemistry of benzofuranoid neolignans deduced by spectral comparison with known analogous derivatives. For the compounds of series 1 [l, 2, 5-7],2 [l, 2,6,7],3 [l, 2 71 and 4 [2, 7] several models are available. These can be used, inclusively, in conformational and configurational correlations. As has been pointed out [2, 51, and is apparent again in Table 2, the relative shielding of the Me-3 protons by the vicinal Ar reveals the cis relation of these groups. It is in this case (6) that H-2 is relatively deshielded and must, thus, lie closer to the O-C=C--C=O (in 1 and 2) or O-Ar (in 3 and 4) plane than in the 2,3tran.v isomers (7). The identification of 5 relied only on data of two models [1,7]. The sequence ofsubstituents on
*These signals were incorrectly considered singlets and assigned to H-7 in ref. [2]. It became clear, subsequently, after shifting of the signals into an interference free region by the LIS technique, that they are doublets_ The signals at 4.54 and 3.95 [Z] represent, respectively, H-7 and H-4ring of the benzofuran system must be, nevertheless, correct, in view of the following evidence. First, a pyridine induced PMR solvent shift [S] demonstrated the vicinity of the allyl-CH, (AT 0.28 ppm) and the hydroxyl. This forms an intramblecular hydrogen bridge [9] to themethoxyl oxygen [V(CH,ClJ 3530 cm-'. invariant upon dilution]. Finally, double irradiation at the PMR methoxyl frequency (T 6.05) caused a 23 % NOE enhancement of the intensity of the aromatic H singlet at .r 3.20.
EXPERIMENTALIsdation ofthe constituents. All plant material was collected at Ducke Forest Reserve, Manaus, Amazonas. The procedure used for Herbarium (INPA, Manaus) Specimen No 46798 is typical. Powdered wood (8 kg) was percolated at room temp. with CsH,. The extract (70 g) was freed of fatty esters (2.2 g) by washing with petrol and chromatographed on a Si gel column, giving the following fractions with C,H,-AcOEt mixtm of the indicated vol/vol compositions : A (1: O), B (9 : l), C (8 : 2), D (6 : 4), E (4 : 6). A (4.3 g) was separated by TLC (petrol+H, 3 : 7) into benzyl benzoate and benzyl salicylate. B (2.8 g) was separated by TLC (C,H,-AcOEt, 98 :2), in order of increasing R,, into a 7 : 3 mixt. of3d and 3(250 mg) and 5 (30 mg). The mixture was septd by fractional cry&. from MeOH. The initial fractions contained pure 3d. C (3.6 g) is mainly sitosterol. D (20.6 g) was septd by filtration into crystalline If (10 g). The oily filtrate was septd by TLC (E&O), into If (R, 0.19)and a 7:3 mixt of 2d &d if (Rr 0.58). The mixture was sentd bv Al,O, TLC fEt,O) into 26 (2b mg) and 2f (50 mg). E (9:4 g) Gas .&pid by ?Le (CHCl,-MeOH 96 :4) into a mixture of lf, 2d and 2f (R, 0.64) and a mixture of6,7-dimethoxycoumarin and bicyclo[3,2,l]octanoid neolignans (to be reported).
