PROTOLIMONOID AND LIGNANS FROM ZANTHOX YLUA4 PETIOLARE*
Seven previously characterized,and two new compounds, have been isolated from the stems and leaves of Zanthoxylum petiolare, which was previously misidentified as Z. acutifolium. The two new compounds have been identified on the basis of spectroscopic evidence as a protolimonoid and a furofuran lignan.'-'Signals may be reversed.

INTRODUflIONAs a part of our continuing investigation into the chemical composition of Brazilian Rutales, we have recently reported the isolation of a quinolone alkaloid series from Zanthoxylum petiolare St. Hil. [l]. Further studies with this plant have led to the isolation of eight compounds, including a new protolimonoid and a furofuran lignan.
RESULTS AlVD DISCUSSIONSolvent extraction of the leaves of Z. petiolare followed by column chromatography of the lipid as described previously [l], led to the isolation of five known compounds: ( +)-sesamin (3) [2, 33, (+)-piperitol (4) [2,3], (+)-piperitol-y,y-dimethylallylether (5 (1700 cm-'), which was also confirmed by 13CNMR (6217.9) [12]. The 'HNMR spectrum for 1 (Table 1) did not, however, have the signals for carbinolic protons as found in 8. The comparison of all spectral data for both 1 and 8 showed that the only difference between them is in the ring A, where a carbonyl is located at C-3 in *Based in part on the Ph.D. Thesis presented by M.S.P.A. to Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Slo Carlos.)

The comparison of 13CNMR spectral data (Table 2) obtained for 1 with those for 8 are in agreement with the structure proposed, including the presence of an epimeric mixture at C-21 as also found for 8 ('-'CNMR: 698.1, 101.9) due to the two possible configurations, z and j?, of the hydroxyl group. Additional confirmation of the structure 1 was obtained through comparison of its IR and 'HNMR, as well as by TLC of its acetylated derivative (9) which cochromatographed with an authentic sample of the 21acetyl-3-oxo-glabretal (10). On the basis of these results the compound was identified as 3-oxo-skimmiarepin.The spectral data observed for 2 were very similar to those for the lignan y,y-dimethylallylpiperitol (5). The presence of the -CH,CH(OH)C(Me)=CH, side chain was deduced from the 'H NMR (Table 3) signals. The signals, 64.96, 5.10 hrs, 1H each, were attributed to the exo-double bond, that at 6 1.77 s, 3H, to the vinyl methyl group and those at 64.09 dd, lH, to the carbinohc proton. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 4) confirmed the presence of the 5-carbon side chain where two olefinic carbons (6143.1, 109.7) were observed, together with 2 carbinolic carbons (673.4, 74.2), as well as a tertiary methyl group (6 18.9). The mass spectrum displayed the parent peak m/z 440 (lOO%), and the fragment m/z 71 (C,H,O). This information allowed us to propose the given structure for this compound, which is the oxidation product of 5, which has previously been isolated from this plant species.   l)yielded 3(86 mg)and6(39 mg)in mixt. with (E,E)-N-(2-methylpropyI)-2,4-tetradecadienamide, and sitosterol). Fr. 2, after recrystallization, afforded lupeol (31 mg). The MeOH extract was screened for alkaloids, but no pure alkaloid was obtained. The only compound isolated from this extract was the glycoside 7 (298 mg).

Similar isolation procedures carried out with the stems of the same plant afforded compounds 3, previously isolated and identified from Skimmia japonica Thumb. var. intermedia Komatsu [I 11, which allowed us to propose that both compounds had the same pentacyclic skeleton and identical side chain at C-17. The IR spectrum of 1 showed a ketone carbonyl
