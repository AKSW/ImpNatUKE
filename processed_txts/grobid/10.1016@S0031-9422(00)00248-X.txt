Pyrano chalcones and a ¯avone from Neoraputia magni®ca and their Trypanosoma cruzi glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitory activities
The fruits of Neoraptua magni®ca var. magni®ca aorded three new ¯avonoids: 2 H -hydroxy-4,4 H ,-dimethoxy-5 H ,6 H -(2 HH ,2 HH -dimethylpyrano)chalcone, 2 H -hydroxy-3,4,4 H -trimethoxy-5 H ,6 H -(2 HH ,2 HH -dimethylpyrano)chalcone, and 3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxy-¯avone which were identi®ed on the basis of spectroscopic methods. The known ¯avonoids 2 H -hydroxy-3,4,4 H ,5-tetramethoxy-5 H ,6 H -(2 HH ,2 HH -dimethylpyrano)chalcone, 2 H -hydroxy-3,4,4 H ,5,6 H -pentamethoxychalcone, 3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxy¯avone, 3 H ,4 Hmethylenedioxy-5 H ,5,6,7-tetramethoxy¯avone, 3 H ,4 H ,5 H ,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avanone and 3 H ,4 H ,5 H ,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avone were also identi®ed. The latter ¯avone was the most active as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-inhibitor

IntroductionAs part of our continuous investigation into the chemical composition of Brazilian Neoraputia (Engler) Emmerich species, we recently reported the isolation of eight polymethoxylated ¯avones and one ¯avanone from N. alba (Engler) Emmerich (Arruda et al., 1991(Arruda et al., , 1993)), four polymethoxylated ¯avones, 2 H -hydroxy-3,4,4 H ,5,6 H -pentamethoxychalcone (1) and 2 H -hydroxy-3,4,4 H ,5-tetramethoxy-5 H ,6 H -(2 HH ,2 HH -dimethylpyrano)chalcone (2) from N. magni®ca var. magni®ca (Engler) Emmerich (Passador et al., 1997). The isolation of these interesting new chalcones combined with our taxonomic interest in the Rutaceae stimulated an investigation of other organs of N. magni®ca var. magni®ca.Chagas' disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is estimated to aect some 16±18 million people,mostly from South and Central America, where 25% of the total population is at risk (World Health Organization). Control of the insect vector (Triotoma infestans) in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination of transmission by insect bites, and, as a consequence, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are currently the major causes for the spread of the disease. Besides low ecacy, the drugs currently available, nifurtimox and benzonidazole, have strong side eects (Souza et al., 1998). The bloodstream form of the parasite T. cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP production (Souza et al., 1998). This great dependence on glycolysis as a source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for trypanocidal drug design. Thus, the three dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined (Souza et al., 1998). GAPDH catalyses the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Glycosomal GAPDH shows potential target sites with signi®cant dierences compared with the homologous human enzyme, and inhibitors have been designed, synthesised, obtained from natural sources, and tested. In order to ®nd blocking agents, chalcones and ¯avones isolated from N. magni®ca were assayed and evaluated by interaction with the enzyme GAPDH from T. cruzi.
Results and discussionThe hexane extract of the ripe fruits of N. magni®ca var. magni®ca, aorded g-tocopherol and three chalcones. One was characterised as 2 H -hydroxy-3,4,4 H ,5-tetramethoxy-5 H ,6 H -(2 HH ,2 HH -dimethylpyrano)chalcone (2) by comparison with both published data and an authentic sample (Passador et al., 1997). Placement of the chromene ring between C-5 H and O-6 H in 2 was determined on the basis of the following data. The 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed features of a chromene ring ( 6.60 and 5.47 vinylic protons, and a singlet at 1.50, 6H, assigned to a pair of magnetically equivalent methyl groups) and signals for four methoxy groups. The assignment of one singlet to H-2 and H-6 ( 6.86, 2H) suggested that three methoxy groups are attached to the B-ring. From a biosynthetic point of view, the remain-ing methoxy group could be attached to C-4 H or C-6 H of the A-ring. The spectrum also revealed a singlet at 14.24 corresponding to one chelated hydroxyl, thus attached to C-2 H . Furthermore, a singlet at 6.07 (1H) clearly indicated the A-ring to be 2 H ,4 H ,5 H ,6 H -or 2 H ,3 H ,4 H ,6 Htetrasubstituted. From the HMBC experiments (Table 2) the observed correlations between the hydroxyl proton at 14.24 and the 13 C signals at 105.9 (J 3 ), 167.9   (J 2 ) and 92.5 (J 3 ) led to their assignments as C-1 H , C-2 H and C-3 H , respectively, thus indicating that the unsubstituted carbon must be vicinal to C-2 H . The 13 C NMR spectrum (Table 3) showed a signal for only one methoxy group attached to the ortho-disubstituted carbon ( 63.1) which was assigned to the 4-OMe functionality. This implies that the methoxy group in the A-ring is located at C-4 H ( 55.9), and therefore established the position of the chromene ring to be between C-5 H and O-6 H . Moreover, the existence of any correlation between the 1 H signal at 6.07, assigned to H-3 H (by HSQC and HMBC), and the 13 C signal at 102.9 (C-5 H ), con®rmed the position of the chromene ring between C-5 H and O-6 H . The mass spectrum and elemental analysis data for 2 are reported here for the ®rst time (see also Scheme 1 and Section 3). Chalcone (3) exhibited similar NMR spectra to that of 2 (Tables 1 and3). In addition to signals described for the A-ring of 2, the 1 H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of a 1,4-disubstituted phenyl moiety ( 7.56 d, J=8.6 Hz,6.93 d,J=8.6 Hz,. The presence of a fragment ion at m/z 161 (Scheme 1) in the mass spectrum for 3, associated with cleavage between the A-ring and C-b H , clearly indicated the presence of one methoxy group in the B-ring. The signal of H-2/H-6 ( 7.56) showed a one-bond correlation (by HSQC) with the 13 C signal at 130.0, and a long-range correlation (by HMBC, Table 2) with the 13 C signal at   For 2, placement of the chromene ring was apparent from the J 3 couplings observed between the hydroxyl proton (2 H -OH) and the 13 C signal for C-3 H , indicating that the unsubstituted carbon must be vicinal to C-2 H . HMBC experiments with 3 did not detect any correlations of the hydroxyl signal with the A-ring carbons. However, the 13 C NMR spectrum of 3 (Table 3) revealed resonances for C-1 H to C-6 H and C-1 HH to C-5 HH in close agreement with the resonances for the corresponding carbons in 2. A singlet at 6.06 (1H) showed a one-bond correlation (HSQC) with the 13 C signal at 92.7, permitting the assignment of these signals to H-3 H and C-3 H , respectively, when compared with 2. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 3 did not show any signal for methoxy groups attached to the ortho-disubstituted carbon (ca 63); they were observed at 55.4 and 55.8. This implies that the methoxy in the A-ring was located at C-4 H and established the position of the chromene ring to be between C-5 H and O-6 H . The signals at 55.4 and 55.8 were then assigned to 4 H -OMe and/or 4-OMe. Based on the above evidence, the correlations from H-3 H to the 13 C signals of C-5 H ( 103.1) and C-1 H ( 106.4) were consistent with the angular structure for 3. The new natural product is, therefore, 2 H -hydroxy-4,4 H -dimethoxy-5 H ,6 H -(2 HH ,2 HH -dimethylpyrano)chalcone (3).Chalcone (4) also showed spectral characteristics of a 2 H -hydroxy-4 H -methoxy-5 H ,6 H -(2 HH ,2 HH -dimethylpyrano)chalcone (Tables 1 and3). HMBC experiments (Table 2) with 4 also did not detect a relationship between the 2 H -OH signal at 14.34 to the A-ring carbons. However, the chemical shifts of the A-ring and chromene carbons were comparable with those for 2 and 3 (Table 3). As discussed above, the signals of the methoxy groups at 55.8 and 56.1 (6H) supported the chromene ring to be between C-5 H and O-6 H . This was also con®rmed by the HMBC experiments, which showed correlations of the H-3 H signal ( 6 between the b-proton at 7.76 and the 13 C signals at 109.4 (J 3 ) and 123.3 (J 3 ) led to their assignments as C-2 and C-6, respectively. The spectrum also showed a correlation of H-6 at 7.20 with the 13 C signal at 149.0 (J 3 ), con®rming a methoxy group at C-4 and showing that this signal can be attributed to C-4. The existence of a correlation between the 1 H signal at 7.16, assigned to H-2, and the 13 C signal at 153.4 determined the position of the other methoxy group at C-3 and permitted the assignment of this signal to C-3. The structure of the new natural product was thus established as 2 Hhydroxy-3,4,4 H -trimethoxy-5 H ,6 H -(2 HH ,2 HH -dimethylpyrano) chalcone (4).It has been noted that the H-b and C-b of a chalcone are more deshielded than the H-a and C-a resonances (Agrawal, 1989). Both are aected by changes in the Bring substitution and C-a also by the presence or absence of a 2 H -or 6 H -oxysubstituent. HSQC experiments of 1±4 showed correlations of 1 H signals at ca 8.0 and 7.7 to the 13 C signals at ca 126 and 142, respectively, indicating apparent anomalies. The methine proton at ca 7.7 showed cross peaks with the C-2 and C-6 signals (Table 2), so permitting the assignment of the up®eld signal at ca 7.7 to H-b. The anisotropic eect of the 5 H ,O-6 H -chromene substituent on the H-a caused a down®eld shift above the usual range for 2 H ,6 H -oxysubstituted chalcones, this resulting in the H-a proton being more deshielded than H-b.The dichloromethane extract of fruits on successive chromatographic separation aorded the ®ve ¯avonoids, 3 H ,4 H ,5 H ,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avanone (Passador et al., 1997), 3 H ,4 H ,5 H ,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avone (5) (Passador et al., 1997), 3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxy-5 H ,5,6,7-tetramethoxy¯avone (6) (Arruda et al., 1993), 3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxy-5,6,7-tri-methoxy¯avone (7), and 3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxy-5,7-di-methoxy¯avone (8). The latter appears to be new.Compound 6 has been isolated from Ageratum conyzoides (Vyas and Mulchandani, 1986) and N. alba (Arruda et al., 1993); however, its 13 C NMR data are reported here for the ®rst time (Table 4). The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 6, permitted the assignments of all carbons (Tables 2 and3). A singlet at 6.55 (1H) showed a one-bond correlation with the 13 C signal at 107.8, and a long-range correlation with the 13 C signals at 126.0 (J 3 ), 160.7 (J 2 ), 177.1 (J 2 ) and 112.9 (J 3 ) permitting their assignments as H-3, C-3, C-1 H , C-2, C-4 and C-10, respectively. Two doublets at 7.06 and 7.07 were coupled to each other and showed a longrange correlation with the C-2 and C-1 H signals, thus indicating these two hydrogens were attached to C-2 H and C-6 H . The 1 H NMR spectrum revealed a signal for three methoxy groups at 3.98 (6H) and 3.99 (3H);however,in HSQC ( 62.2,56.9,56.3) and HMBC experiments these signals appeared as a broad singlet. The observed correlations between the methoxy protons at 3.98/or 3.99 and the 13 C signal at 143.8 (J 3 ), which showed cross peaks with the 1H signal at 7.07, led to their assignments as 5 H -OMe, C-5 H and H-6 H . The signal at 7.06 was then assigned to H-2 H . HSQC experiments permitted the assignments of 13 C signal at 100.4, 106.6 and 56.3/or 56.9 to C-2 H , C-6 H and 5 H -OMe, respectively. HMBC experiments also con®rmed the B-ring to have a methylenedioxy group between C-3 H and C-4 H by the cross peaks with the 1 H signal of OCH 2 O at 6.08 with the 13 C signals at 149.5 and 138.1, which showed correlations with H-2 H and the latter ( 138.1) with H-6 H . The signals at 149.5 and 138.1 were then assigned to C-3 H and C-4 H , respectively. The 13 C signal at 102.2 could be attributed to OCH 2 O by HSQC.The 13 C NMR spectrum showed signals for two methoxy groups at 61.5 and 62.2. Thus implies that the methoxy groups in the A-ring are located at C-5, C-6 and C-7, since the 1 H signal at 6.78 (1H) for the unsubstituted methine indicated that this proton must not be vicinal to CO (C-4). Thus, the observed one-bond correlation between the signal of H-8 ( 6.78) and the 13 C signal at 96.2 led to the assignment of C-8 to this resonance. The methoxy protons at 3.92 showed a one-bond correlation with the 13 C signal at 61.5, and a long-range correlation with the 13 C signal at 140.4 (J 3 ), suggesting the assignment of the latter signal to C-6 or C-5. The presence of a correlation between the signal of H-8 and the 13 C signal at 140.4 (J 3 ) clearly indicated this signal to be at C-6. The signal for C-7 was established as 157.7 by the existence of a correlation a Control: 50 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.6 buer, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM bmercapto-ethanol, 30 mM Na 2 HAsO 4 , 2.5 mM NAD + , 0.3 mM glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 4±9 mg protein and 10% DMSO, in a total volume of 1000 ml. Positive control: coumarin chalepin: concentration (mg/ml): 30, (U/mg): 3.50,% inhibitory activity=75, IC 50 =64 mM. (Calenbergh et al., 1995).between the H-8 resonance and this 13 C signal (J 2 ), which also showed a cross peak with the methoxy protons at 3.98/or 3.99 and the latter with the 13 C signal at 56.3 or 56.9. In the same way, the signal for C-5 emerged from analysis of the correlation between the methoxy signal at 3.98/or 3.99 ( 62.2 by HSQC) and the 13 C signal at 152.6, which did not show a correlation with the H-8 signal. The H-8 signal also showed a cross-peak with the 13 C signal at 154.4 (J 2 ), which was attributed to C-9, since it was the only carbon to be assigned in the A-ring.Flavone 8 exhibited a B-ring spin system in the 1 H NMR spectrum for 3 H ,4 H -substitution ( 7.54, dd, J=1.8 and 0.4 Hz, H-2 H ; 6.98, dd, J=8.1 and 0.4 Hz, H-5 H ; 7.51, dd, J=8.1 and 1.8, H-6 H ). This spectrum also showed signals for a meta-coupled A-ring protons ( 6 .55,d,J=2.3 Hz,6.78,d,J=2.3 Hz,, two methoxy groups ( 3.85, s, 6H) and one methylenedioxy group ( 6.07, s, 2H). The retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) (Chen et al., 1997) fragments of this ¯avone gives a good indication of the substitution patterns of the A-and B-rings (Scheme 2). Thus, a combination of 1 H NMR spectral data and the fragment ions at m/z 146 (70%) and 180 (5%) fully support the presence of a 3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxy substituent in the B-ring and a 5,7-dimethoxy system in the A-ring.HSQC experiments permitted assignments of all protonated carbons (Table 3). However, the 13 C signals at 96.8 and 93.7 were attributed to C-6 and C-8, and the 1 H signals at 6.55 and 6.78 to H-6 and H-8, respectively, by comparison with the resonances for the corresponding carbons and hydrogens in 3 H ,4 H ,5 H ,5,7-pentamethoxy¯avone (5). The quaternary carbons of the A-and C-rings ( 160.2, C-2; 176.6, C-4; 161.3, C-5; 164.4, C-7; 160.1, C-9; 109.7, C-10) were also assigned by comparison with those of 5 ( 160.5, C-2; 177.5, C-4; 161.0, C-5; 164.1, C-7; 159.9, C-9; 109.3, C-10), whose assignments were aided by 13 C± 1 H COSY and long-range 13 C± 1 H COSY spectra (Kinoshita and Firman, 1997). The signal for C-3 H was established as 148.9 by its comparison with the resonance for the corresponding carbon in 6. The signal at 150.6 was then assigned to C-4 H . The structure of ¯avone 8 was thus established as 3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxy-5,7-dimethoxy¯avone. Flavone 5 was previously obtained from N. alba (Arruda et al., 1993) and Murraya paniculata (Rutaceae) (Kinoshita and Firman, 1997).3 H ,4 H -Methylenedioxy-5,6,7-trimethoxy¯avone (7, age-cony¯avone A) has been found previously in Ageratum conyzoides (Asteraceae) (Vyas et al., 1986). However, its 13 C NMR spectral data have not been reported previously in the literature. The chemical shifts of the A-and B-ring carbons were comparable with those for 6 and 8, respectively (Table 3).All phytochemical studies on Neoraputia genus have been undertaken in our laboratory, and isolation procedures used in these studies should have revealed rutaceous alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids if they had been present. However, it is premature to use the absence of other classes of compounds as an argument to remove Neoraputia to the Citroideae, which produces a considerable number of highly oxygenated ¯avones (Passador et al., 1997;Silva, et al., 1988). Clearly much more detailed phytochemical investigations of Neoraputia species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutaceae.Some compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the protein glycosomal GAPDH from T. cruzi (Table 4). Chalcone 2 was separated from 4 and ¯avone 6 from 7 by R-HPLC; however, they were obtained in very small amount. Thus, only the initial inhibitory activity of these mixtures were evaluated. GAPDH activity was only inhibited by 45% when the mixture of 2 and 4 was added to the assay system at a concentration of 105 mg/ml, suggesting that these chalcones act as weak inhibitors. The mixture of 6 and 7 completely inhibited the enzymatic activity (by 100%) at 100 mg/ml.The activity of ¯avone 5 was comparable to that of the mixture of 6±7, reducing the enzymatic activity by 99% at 100 mg/ml. The 50% inhibitory concentration value (IC 50 ) was 81 mM.Highly oxygenated ¯avones appear to possess the structural requirements for inhibiting trypanosomal Scheme 2. Mass spectral fragmentation of 8.GAPDH. However, to develop an eective blocking agent from the natural product lead compounds, it is necessary to determine as precisely as possible, how the tested compounds occupy the active site and at the same time how they make speci®c interactions with the amino acids of the target enzyme. For this purpose co-crystallization experiments with ¯avone 5 have been undertaken, both in laboratory and under microgravity conditions, in the NASA Space Shuttle during mission STS-91, in May 1998. Unfortunately, we did not have any success with ¯avone 5, and eective crystallization was observed only for a rutaceous coumarin. The related crystallographic studies are in progress and will be reported separately.Therefore, we still have not enough experimental evidence for developing a quantitative understanding of the structural basis of the speci®city in the catalytic-siteactivity relationships among ¯avones and the enzyme GAPDH. Further crystallization experiments as well as solution studies by NMR spectral analysis are in progress.

T. cruzi GAPDH-activityTc GAPDH activity was determined according to a modi®cation of a previously reported procedure (Barbosa and Nakano, 1987). Reduced NADH was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at 30 s intervals. The reaction medium was 50 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.6 buer, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM b-mercapto-ethanol, 30 mM Na 2 HAsO 4 , 2.5 mM NAD + , 0.3 mM glyceraldehyde-3phosphate and 4±9 mg protein, in a total volume of 1000 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme.The speci®c activity (unit=U) of the enzyme was calculated as below:amg ÁsorneaÁt Â volume of ell È É a6X22Â volume of enzyme Â enzyme where Át=0.5 min; volume of cell=1.00 ml; e NADH= 6.22 (mMol/cm 3 ) À1 cm À1 ; volume of enzyme=0.005 ml; [ ] concentration of enzyme in mg/ml.
T. cruzi GAPDH-inhibitory activityThe inhibitory activity was recorded using the reaction medium as above, in a total volume of 1000 ml.Absorbance was read at 340 nm at 30 s intervals. Compound 5 was tested at 30, 50 and 100 mg/ml in 10% DMSO using 5 ml of GAPDH-9 (prepared in January 1998) at 0.90 mg/ml. The mixture of 6 and 7 was tested at 25, 35 and 100 mg/ml in 10% DMSO using 5 ml of GAPDH-10 (prepared in February 1998) at 1.09 mg/ml. The mixture of 2 and 4 was tested at 105 mg/ml as for the mixture above.In each case, a blank experiment was performed with 10% DMSO alone in the reaction medium and was used as a positive control. The speci®c activity of TcGAPDH was not signi®cantly aected by 10% DMSO alone.Data were means of three repetitions and values as a percent of control were used as follows:7 inhiitory tivity amg ompound È À amg ontrolaamg ontrol É Â 100X161. 1 (1J 3 ), thus indicating the methoxy group to be located at C-4 and permitting the assignment of the signal at 161.1 to C-4. HSQC experiments also showed correlations of the signal of H-3/H-5 ( 6.93) with the 13 C signal at 114.5. In addition, the signal of H-a ( 8.02) showed cross peaks with the 13 C signal at128.4, indicating this signal to C-1.
