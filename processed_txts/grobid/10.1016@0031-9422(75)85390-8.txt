respectively. Previous work. S. chamaedryfolia and S. luteola none; S. hyssopijblia studies of the essential oil [l]. Present work. The diterpene constituents of the three species quoted above have been investigated.? S. chmnaedryfolia yield two compounds previously described: ent-15kaurene-7x, 18-diol (sideridiol) [2] and ent-16-kaurene-3/?,7c(,18-trio1 (foliol) [3]. S. hyssopijblia gave only a known diterpene : ent-7a-acetoxy-1 $kauren-18-01 (siderol) [Z]. Finally S. luteola gave three diterpenic compounds also known: ent-16-kaurene-3/?,7c(,18-trio1 (foliol), ent-3P-acetoxy-16-kaurenet For general details on extraction and separation of diterpenes from .%&-iris see Von Carstenn-Lichterfelde, C., Val-Verde, S. and Rodriguez, B.

Ocotea macrophylla H.B.K., trivial name "louro fofo", a tree, was collected at Ducke Forest Reserve, near Manaus, and identified by the botanist W. Rodrigues upon comparison of a voucher specimen (42226) with specimen 14721, both deposited at Instituto National de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Manaus, Amazonas. Plant. Ocotea sp. trivial name "louro", a tree, was collected at Ducke Forest Reserve, near Manaus, and classified by the botanist W. Rodrigues. A voucher specimen (42208) was deposited at Instituto National de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Manaus.Me0 Me0 L-6 (1)Trunk wood (10 kg). A C,H, ext. (8 g) was chromatographed on a silica column. Elution with C,H, gave, in order, aliphatic alcohols, n-tetracosyl ferulate (1.5 g), sitosterol (200 mg), l-(p-methoxybenzyl)-6,7-methylenedioxyisoquinoline (2 g) and 1-(p-methoxybenzyl)-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline (800 mg). The structural proposals were based on spectral comparisons with other alcaloids of the papaverine type [7]. Although hitherto unreported, their presence in Lauraceae is in line with the isolation of I-(p-hydroxybenzyl)-6.7-dimethoxyisoquinoline from a Cryptocuryu species [S]. n-Tetracosyl ferulate, mp 63" (CClJ.

Sponsored by Ministerio do Planejamento (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos S.A.) through Academia Brasileira de Ciincias and by Funda-$50 de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de S%o Pafilo.Trunk wood (1.4 kg). A C6H, ext. was crystallized from C6H6 to crude nantenine (16g) which was chromatographed on a silica column. Elution with C,H6 gave, in order, fatty esters (1 g), dehydronantenine (800 mg), sitosterol(1 g) and (+)-nantenine (8 g). Elution with C,H,-AcOEt 1: 1 gave a mixture (3 g). This was chromatographed on an alumina column. Elution with C6H6 gave dehydronantenine (50 mg), (+)-nantenine (1 g) and a mixture (150 mg). This was separated by TLC on alumina (C,H,-AcOEt 8: 2) into (+ )-isocoridine (50 mg) and (+ )-glaucine (40 mg). Identities were established by comparison of mp and spectral data with lit. data of (+)-nantenine, (+)-isocoridine and (+)-glaucine [2-41. The structure of dehydronantenine(1) was deduced by spectral data and confirmed by comparison of the isolate with a synthetic sample prepared byKMnO, of nantenine in 70% yield. While (+ )isocoridine is widespread in Lauraceae genera (+)-nantenine was located at least inCassytha [6], the occurrences of (+)-glaucine in the family and of dehydronantenine in nature do not seem to have been reported previously.Dehydronantenine, yellow needles, mp 197" (&H,-C,H, a) CM 337.1320, C&H, gN04 requires 337.13143. \?z;: (cm-')1625 , 1600 , 1500 . 1460 ,  1400 , 1300 , 1225 , 1085 , 1040, IOQO. ;, IOQO. ;.Fay (nm):  258, 295, 333 (log E 4.51, 3.95, 3.82).
