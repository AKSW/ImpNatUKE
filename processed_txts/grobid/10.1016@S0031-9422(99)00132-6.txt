A chromene and prenylated benzoic acid from Piper aduncum
In addition to nerolidol, 2',6 '-dihydroxy-4 '-methoxydihydrochalcone, methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3 '-methyl-2 '-butenyl)-2H-1chromene-6-carboxylate, methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylate and methyl 8-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylate, two new natural products were isolated from the leaves of Piper aduncum, 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6carboxylic acid and 3-(3',7'-dimethyl-2 ',6 '-octadienyl)-4-methoxybenzoic acid. The structures of the isolates were established based on analysis of spectroscopic data, including ES±MS. The DNA-damaging activity of the isolated compounds was also investigated against mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

IntroductionChemical studies carried out on Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of a variety of compounds including essential oils, pyrones, lignoids and unsaturated amides (Parmar et al., 1997;AleÂ cio, Bolzani, Young, Kato, & Furlan, 1998). The species Piper aduncum L. is used as remedy for stomach aches and as an insect repellent (Asprey & Thornton, 1954). Previous investigations on P. aduncum have described phenylpropanoids, such as myristicin and dillapiol, benzoic acid derivatives, chromenes and ¯avonoids (Burke & Nair, 1986;Orjala, Eldelmeier, Wright, Rali, & Sticher, 1993a;1993b;Moreira, GuimaraÄ es, & Kaplan, 1998). During the course of chemical studies on P. aduncum we isolated seven compounds, including a new chromene 1 and a new benzoic acid derivative 5.In the search for potential anticancer agents employing a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents (Gunatilaka, Samaranayake, Kingston, Hofmann, & Johnson, 1992;Gunatilaka, Kingston, & Johnson, 1994), it was found that the chromenes 2,2- 4) and the benzoic acid derivative, 3-(3 ',7 '-dimethyl-2 ',6 '-octadienyl)-4-methoxybenzoic acid (5), were active. Although chromene and benzoic acid derivatives are frequently isolated from Piper species and many of them exhibit diverse biological activity such as antimicrobial, molluscicidal (Orjala et al., 1993b), germination inhibition, fungicidal (Nair & Burke, 1990) and insecticidal activities (Bernard et al., 1995), there is no previous report describing damaging eect on DNA. In this paper we report the structure elucidation for two new isolated compounds 1 and 5 and the growth inhibitory eects of compounds 1±5 against strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  0123456789dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylic acid (1), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3 '-methyl-2 '-butenyl)-2H-1-chromene- 6-carboxylate (2), methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene- 6-carboxylate (3), methyl 8-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-chromene-6-carboxylate (
Results and discussionA CH 2 Cl 2 -soluble part of MeOH extract of the leaves of P. aduncum was fractionated by CC on silica gel followed by HPLC to aord compounds 1±5, nerolidol and 2 ',6 '-dihydroxy-4 '-methoxydihydrochalcone.2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylic acid (1) was shown to have a molecular formula C 12 H 12 O 3 by analysis of its electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS), 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 2400±3400/1680 and 1600/1445 cm À1 characteristic of carboxylic acid and aromatic groups, respectively. Its 1 H NMR spectrum exhibited close similarities to those of 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylate 3 (Burke & Nair, 1986) by the presence of two doublets at d 5.65 and 6.34 (9.9 Hz) and a singlet at d 1.46 (2 CH 3 ) and, as in the case of 3, its spectrum showed three aromatic signals at d 7.86 (dd, J=2.0 and 8.4 Hz), 7.72 (d, J=2.0 Hz) and 6.79 (d, J=8.4 Hz), corroborating the presence of a trisubstituted aromatic ring. As indicated by IR and by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra (Table 1), the methyl ester function in 3 was replaced by a carboxylic acid function (d C 171.0) and the structure of compound 1 was deter-mined as depicted.3-(3 ',7 '-dimethyl-2 ',6 '-octadienyl)-4-methoxybenzoic acid (5) has the molecular formula C 18 H 22 O 4 deduced by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and 13 C NMR data. In its IR spectrum, absorptions for an aromatic acid carbonyl group (1680 cm À1 ) and an aromatic ring (1600, 1490 cm À1 ) were present, while the UV spectrum displayed an absorption maximum at 254 nm (log E 3.8) corresponding to the aromatic ring.The 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 5 showed signals corresponding to three coupled aromatic resonances at d 6.87 (d, 1H, J=8.4 Hz), 7.88 (d, 1H, J=2.2 Hz) and 7.96 (dd, 1H J=8.4, 2.2 Hz) for a 1,4,5-trisubstituted aromatic ring and d H 1.34 (1H, s); it also displayed a singlet at 3.90 (3H, s) for a carboxylic acid  (Orjala et al., 1993b).The known compounds 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3-methyl-2butenyl)-2H-chromene-6-carboxylate (2), methyl 2,2dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylate (3), methyl 8hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-chromene-6-carboxylate (4) and 2',6 '-dihydroxy-4 '-methoxydihydrochalcone were previously isolated from the same source (Burke & Nair, 1986;Diaz, Arias, & Nathan, 1987;Orjala et al., 1993a;Moreira et al., 1998), while nerolidol (Ramos, Da Silva, Luz, Zoghbi, & Maia, 1986) was isolated for the ®rst time from P. aduncum.Compounds 1±5 were evaluated against genetically engineered mutants of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have showed IC 12 values of 120 and 100; 130 and 100; 105 and 120; 110 and 120; 130 and 120 mg/ml against the mutant yeast strains RS 321N and RS 322YK (rad 52Y), respectively. Even though the activity could be considered weak, they were selective towards mutant strains lacking DNA cleavage repair mechanism since they were inactive (IC 12 >1,000 mg/ ml) against the `wild type' strain RS 188N (rad +) (Gunatilaka et al., 1992;1994). As there is no previous report on the activity of chromene compounds on DNA, the data obtained here are the basis for our further search for antitumoral or fungicidal compounds in the Piperaceae.
Experimental
Instrumentation and chromatography materialsSilica gel (Merck 230±400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, using CDCl 3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES±MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10AS using a reversed phase column (Waters Nova Pak, C 18 ; 3.9 Â 150 mm) eluted with MeOH:H 2 O (3:2), ¯ow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detection at 254 nm.
Plant materialPiper aduncum L. (Piperaceae) leaves were collected at Reserva da Ripasa, IbateÂ , SP and identi®ed by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, PeruÂ ). The voucher specimen is deposited at Departamento de Ecologia, Instituto de BiocieÃ ncias-USP.
BioassaysThe screening methods utilizing mutant strains of S. cerevisiae have been described elsewhere (Gunatilaka et al., 1992). IC 12 values refer to the concentration in mg/ml required to produce an inhibition zone of 12 mm diameter around a 100 ml well during a 48 h incubation period at 378C. The positive control camptothecin was active at 5.0 ml/ml for RS 322YK and at 200 ml/ml for RS 188N; streptonigrin was active at 4.0 ml/ ml for RS 321N.
Extraction and isolation of constituentsThe CH 2 Cl 2 -soluble part of MeOH extract of powdered leaves of P. aduncum (24.0 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane containing increasing volumes of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 46 fractions (A 1 ±A 46 ). Fraction A 3 (961.5 mg) was applied to a silica gel column (2.5 g) 230±400 mesh, eluted with hexane containing increasing concentrations of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 14 fractions (B 1 ±B 14 ). Fraction B 2 aorded compound 2 (13.0 mg). Fraction A 4 (218.0 mg) was chromatographed via silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 10 fractions (C 1 ±C 10 ). Fraction C 5 (133.0 mg) yielded pure compound 3 (23.0 mg). Fraction A 5 was chromatographed on silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give nerolidol (180 mg). Fraction A 11 (675.6 mg) yielded the pure compound 4 (171 mg). Fraction A 13 (980.0 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel CC, eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 90%) to give the compound 2 ',6 '-dihydroxy-4 'methoxydihydrochalcone (408.0 mg). Fraction A 14 , a green gum (25.0 mg), was further puri®ed by reversedphase HPLC, as described in the general experimental procedures, to give 5 (12.3 mg). The dried and powdered leaves (1.003 g) of P. aduncum were extracted with EtOAc (®ve times, 150 ml each). The resulting extract (325.6 mg) was dissolved in CHCl 3 and partitioned with an aqueous solution of NaHCO 3 (six times, 50 ml each). The aqueous fraction was neutralized with HCl (6 N) and submitted to partition with EtOAc (three times, 100 ml each) to give a residue (248.0 mg). This fraction (248.0 mg) was submitted to a prep.
