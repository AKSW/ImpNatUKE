gave an oil (1 kg) which was distilled under vacuum in order to remove volatile compounds.The residue (332g) was submitted to column and prep. TLC to yield 102mg of 4 (system I, R, 0.55; system 2, R, 0.46) and 0.7 mg of 5 (system 1, R, 0.61; system 2, R, 0.52), identified by comparison with authentic samples (TLC, IR. mmp). 4 was also found in the EtOH extract (4 mg).Aristolochic acid lu methyl ester methyl ether (4). The fraction containing the aristolochic acids from 13.3 kg dried roots was fractionated in phenolic and nonphenolic acids by countercurrent distribution as previously reported [I]. A portion of the phenolic acid mixture, after the removal of the main components by crystallization (dioxane). was treated with CH:N: and submitted to prep. TLC (system I, R, 0.~55; system 2. R, 0.46) yielding the methyl ester of 0-methylaristolochic acid Ia. 2.4 mg, identical to aristolochic acid I methyl ester (4).Aristolochic acid la ethyl ester ethyl ether (6) [2] (Table 1). Nomenclature and numbering of neolignans follow the rules outlined in a recent review [6].*Part LXVIII in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae".For Part LXVII see ref.[l].Such is the similarity of the spectral data that even stereochemical identity can be assumed to exist. Thus, the reciprocal y-effect between C-5' and C-7' noted for porosin (3b) [5] is reproduced by la which must also bear H-5' and the ally1 group in a cis relationship. The sole significant differences in the spectra refer to the NMR signals of all ally1 protons, which appear at a consistently higher field in la than in 3a and 3b, and of the carbon at position 6', which appears at lower field in la than in 3a and 3b. The signal of C-6' of 3a and 3b is located at a relatively high field due to the protective y-effect of the cis-methyl on C-8. Since no such protection of C-6' occurs in la, the existence of a tmns-methyl could be suspected.In this case C-7'   .should suffer the y-effect. This also does not happen.The chemical shifts for C-7' of all three compounds are practically identical (6 39.420.4).Thus in comparison with 3a and 3b, in la methyl and aryl must be interchanged.The carbon of position 1 of the aryl not substituted by hydrogen, is not expected to protect significantly either C-6' or C-7'. Indeed. the presence of the aryl group in close proximity of the ally1 protons is the sole reasonable explanation for their absorption at relatively high fields. -
8. clearly a carbinolic proton (6 5.05), in la causes the collapse of the methyl-doublet (6 1.48) to a singlet; and viceversa, irradiation of H-9 causes the change of the H-8 multiplet to a doublet of J = 10.5 Hz. This coupling constant, much larger than JH_T.H_X ( = 5 Hz) in the porosins (3a, 3b), as well as the chemical shift of the methyl protons (S 1.48). which are more shielded (&,,, = 0.5) in the porosins, points to a trans-arylmethyl relationship in la. All other possible decoupling experiments were performed and led to the expected results. The presence of a small amount of chrysophyllin B (lb) in the extract was detected by 'H NMR spectral means. The biosynthesis of the porosin type neolignans (3) was postulated to involve coupling of the propenylphenol and the allylphenol derived radicals 4 and 5 [6]. By analogy, the biosynthesis of the chrysophyllin type neolignans would require the coupling of 4 A sample of trunk wood of L. chrysophyffa (Meissn.) Kosterm. (voucher Xyl. 7265, Herb 92081. INPA.
