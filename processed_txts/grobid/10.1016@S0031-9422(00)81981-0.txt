CANTHINONES FROM SIMABA CUSPIDATA *
Two new alkaloids, 8-methoxycanthin-6-one and 3-methoxycanthin-2,6-dione, were isolated from the EtOH extract of the bark of Simaba cuspidata Spruce ex Engl. Elucidation of the structure of the latter compound included '% NMR spectral comparison with 2-methoxypyridine-N-oxide and N-methoxy-2pyridone.

INTRODUCTION
Simaba cuspidataSpruce ex Engl., var. typica Cronquist, an arborescent shrub or small tree, is common in the Rio Negro forest of Amazonas, Brazil [l]. Its bark gave an EtOH extract from which a yellow and a red alkaloid, characterized respectively as 8-methoxycanthin-6-one (la) and 3-methoxycanthin-2,6-dione (k), were isolated.
RESULTSThe yellow alkaloid (CISHIOOZNZ, mp 175-176") shows in the IR spectrum a band at 1670cm-' in agreement with the presence of a lactam. The MS exhibits a M' (m/e 250) compatible with a methoxycanthinone and a fragmentation pattern similar to that of other canthinones [2][3][4]. The UV spectrum is also compatible with a canthinone structure [2-S]: addition of acid, but not of base, causes a bathochromic shift of the maxima. The reduction product of the yellow alkaloid with Zn/HCI has a UV reminiscent of /3carboline derivatives [6]. The 'H NMR spectrum at 100 MHz permits a detailed analysis indicating the absence of substitution on rings C and D and the presence of a methoxy group. This must be located at C-8, since the signal at 88.13, attributed to H-7 by virtue of its low field location, shows no ortho-coupling (Table 1). Structure la is therefore proposed. The red alkaloid (mp> 320", strong green fluorescence in solution) shows in the IR spectrum an intense band at 1640 cm -', indicating again at least one lactam carbonyl group. There is no evidence of OH groups.
R2Jc-xyqR'The high-resolution MS and elemental analysis signify a molecular formula of C,,H,,O,N, with one more oxygen atom than la. Otherwise, the MS is similar to that of la, except for the facile loss of 31 amu, probably a OMe group, from the M'.The UV spectrum is again in agreement with a canthinone structure. This time, however, the spectrum is not altered by the addition of either acid or base, indicating the absence of a phenolic function and the lack of basicity of both nitrogen atoms. Again, the UV spectrum of the Zn/HCI reduction product indicates a /3 -carboline.The 'H NMR spectrum at 270 MHz, including the irradiation of each signal in turn, unambiguously establishes a sequence of 4 protons in ring A and of 2 protons in ring D (Table 1). Both the OMe grr-z and the additional oxygen must therefore be Ir.calzd at ring C. This ring must also contain the only remaining proton, represented by a singlet at 87.27. This relatively high field position excludes one possible structure, 1-methoxycanthin-6-one-3-oxide (5a), since in the unsubstituted N-oxide, i.e. in canthin-6-one-3-oxide (Sb), H-l and H-2 appear at 67.78 and 8.32, respectively [4].Thus only two structures need to be considered: 2methoxycanthin-6-one-3-oxide (5~) and 3-methoxycanthin-2,6-dione (2a). To enable the differentiation of these possibilities, the 13C NMR spectrum of the natural product was obtained (Table 1). The methine carbon signals could be in part assigned by correlating residual couplings in the single-frequency offresonance decoupled (sford) spectrum with the known 'H chemical shifts and by chemical shift considerations. A striking feature in the spectrum is the low field absorption of the OMe carbon (S64.8), as compared with other MeO-aryl functions, e.g. 2-methoxypyridine (853.1) [7]. Since both N-oxide formation and the substitution of the OMe group on nitrogen could conceivably cause deshielding of the carbon in question, 2-methoxypyridine-N-oxideiv 28 R'=OMe, R2=H 2b R'=H, R'=OMe(3) and its thermal rearrangement product, N-methoxy-2-pyridone (4) [8-lo] were run as models (Table 2). While the b- pound is 'normal' (S57.3), in the latter its signal [2,4] in the bark of Simaroubaceae species suggests the appears at 664.5, almost the same as in the natural ease of bio-oxidation of both positions, C-2 and N-3, product. The red substance is, therefore, 3-methoxy-to be similar. It can thus be proposed, albeit only canthin-2,6-dione (28).
