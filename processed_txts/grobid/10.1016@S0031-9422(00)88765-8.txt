BENZOFURANOID NEOLIGNANS FROM LlCARIA ARMENIACA* CACILDA
The trunkwood of Licuria armeniuca (NIXS) Kosterm. (Lauraceae) contains sitosterol, 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin and two novel benzofuranoid neolignans: (2S, 3S, 3aR, SR>3a-allyl-S-methoxy-and 5,7-dimethoxy-2-(3', 4'-methylenedioxypheyl)-3-methyl-2,3,3u,4,5,6-~x~ydro-6-oxo~~of~ans.

The possibility of physoxanthin being a mono-cis isomer of j?-cryptoxanthin (2) [6, 71 is inconsistent with its electronic spectrum and chiroptical properties. Monocis-2 is predicted to show opposite Cotton effect of all-trans-2 [4].In conclusion, the CD data of physoxanthin evaluated in relation to accumulated knowledge on CD properties of carotenoids is taken to disprove a mono-cis form of 2 and 3' (or 2') hydroxylation of the e-ring, and is compatible with physoxanthin being identical with cr-cryptoxanthin (5) [S]. The occurrence in Physalis alkekengi of other carotenoids with end group c, namely cryptoxanthin (2), zeaxanthin (7) and lutein (3) supports the preference for a 3-hydroxy-b-ring in physoxanthin. Although the reported melting points for a-cryptoxanthin (5) [9] from Capsicum annuum and physoxanthin [lo], differed, this is not uncommon, and failure to separate them chromatographically also favours the assignment of identical structures. 2 (2Wood of the Amazonian Lauraceae species Licaria armeniacu (Nees) Kosterm. contains, besides sitosterol and 6,7&nethoxycoumarili, two novel compounds, C,sH,,O, . OMe (la) and C,,H,,O, . O,CH,(OMe), (lb). Spectral data indicate both to belong to the small group of hexahydro-6-oxobenzofuran neolignans, represented so far only by canellin-B (lc) [l] and porosin (ld) PI. Concerning the aliphatic C&-moiety, Id is a useful model for la, both zshowing the H-7 PMR singlet at * Part 52 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae". For Part 51 see ref. [I]. Based on part of the Doctorate thesis submitted by F. M. P. to Universidade de so Paul0 (1978). Sponsored by Fundaqclo de Amparoa Pesquisa do Estado de Sz%o Paulo. Me = methyl, Al = allyl, PI = piperonyl, Ve = veratryl. t 4.4, while lc is a model for 14 both showing an additional OMe singlet instead of the H-7 signal. Concerning the aromatic C&,-moiety, lc is a better model for la and lb than ld, not only on account of the O,CH, substitution, all 3 compounds (la, 14 lc) leading to diagnostic MS fragments of m/e 162 [PiCHCHMe]+' and 149 [PiCOJ', but also to the trans relation of the substituents at C-2 and 3, all 3 compounds showing Me resonances at lower field (z 8.8) than porosin (z 9.5). Although contigurationally identical, the ffsubstituents of la, lb vs lc show different conformations, as expressed by J,, H_J respectively 2 vs 10 Hz Canellin-B (lc) and lb bemn'g lsomeric, this can be due to difference in chirality at C-3a. Indeed, the a-aryl at C-2 confers relative protection upon the a-CHz.at C-3a of la and lb (t 7.65, 7.84) and the axial a-H at C-4 of lc (r 8.24), as compared to the &CH at C-3a of lc and Id (z 7.4,7.5) and the axial P-H at CA of la (z 8.16). The relative configuration shown in la and lb also repreaents the absolute ~~~~0~ of the compounds, on the assumption that the correlation between a positive Cotton effect at 285nm and (2S)-chirality, deduced for 2,3,3n,6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofurans [3], is valid in the present case. Partial epimerization at C-2 of la reduced the intensity of the corresponding ORD band, evidence for the correctness of the assignment of the wavel~~ to the benzenoid chromophore. He~hy~~6-oxo~~fur~ neolignans such as la, lb, lc and Id arc putative biogenetic precursors of the seemingly much mom numerous class of tetrahydro-6oxobeuzofurans 14-J. It may, therefore, be anticipated that many further hexahydro&rivatives exist in nature. EXPERIMENTAL Isolation of the constituents.
