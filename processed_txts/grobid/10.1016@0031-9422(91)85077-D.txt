CAFFEIC ACID ESTERS AND TRITERPENES OF ALIBERTIA MACROPH YLLA
The leaves also contain cafleic acid. The acetone extract of the stems of A. macrophyllu contain a-amyrin, /?-amyrin, a-amyrenone, /I-amyrenone, lupeol, lupenone and germanicone. Structural assignments were taken through spectral data analysis and physical properties. This is the first report on the chemistry of Alibertia.

INTRODUCTIONThe economic and therapeutic importance of many species of Rubiaceae is well known in Brazil, where this family includes representatives belonging to 125 genera [ 11. The region of Sgo Paulo has ca 204 registered species; they are herbs, shrubs or trees growing in the forest and 'cerrado' [l J. Alibertia mucrophylla K. Schum was of interest for phytochemical studies as the presence of fungitoxic constituents in a polar extract of its leaves has been shown [2, 33, also, no previous studies of Alibertia have been undertaken. We report the isolation of caffeic acid and two of its esters from the leaves of A. macrophylla. We have also examined the stems of this species: a-amyrin, /?-amyrin, a-amirenone, /I-amirenone, lupeol, lupenone and germanicone were isolated and identified. The structural assignments for the two new natural derivatives of caffeic acid are presented and discussed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe hydroalcoholic extract prepared from the leaves of A. macrophylla showed, when submitted to TLC and bioassay with Cladosporium sphaerospermum, the presence of three zones of inhibition at R, 0.22,0.36 and 0.65 [43. By a combination of partition into solvent systems and chromatographic methods la-c were isolated from a 40% ethanol extract. The spectral properties of lb and c showed these substances as esters of caffeic acid. A molecular ion peak at m/z 284 was found for lb (CI,H,604) and at m/z 266 for lc (C14H,s05). The molecular formulae were also supported by the "CNMR data (Table 1). The IR spectra of both compounds showed the presence of a&unsaturated ester carbonyl (1695, 1630cn-'), aromatic rings (1610 and 1520 cm -' and of hydroxyl groups (335&3340 cm -').The 'H NMR spectra of la and lb indicated aromatic protons as an ABX system (Table 2) and a pattern similar to that of caffeic acid is suggested. It is significant that the values summarized in Table 2 are in good agreement with those published for calTeic acid and its derivatives [S-8]. The main differences between lb and c seem to be related to the alcoholic portion of the esters and were clearly shown by 'H and 13CNMR data. For lb, the presence of a second aromatic ring bearing a two carbon lateral chain was suggested: the 'H NMR spectra showed a broad singlet (SH) at 67.24 and two triplets at 62.64 (J = 7.5 Hz) and 3.68 (J = 7.5 Hz) which can respectively be assigned to the benzilic and to the carbinolic protons of a 2-phenylethoxy unit. For le. the following features were deduced from 'H NMR: the signals at 64.00 and 3.86 were assigned to four carbinolic protons and the doublet at 1.01 should correspond to the protons of a    The acetone extract of the stems (160 g) of A. macrophylla was also examined. After partition into the system MeOH-Hz0 (9: I)-n-hexane, the hexane solubles (660 mg) submitted to prep. TLC (n-hexane_EtOAc, 4:l) led to the separation of: a-and b-amyrin (2a+Ja, 198 mg), lupeol (4a, 20 mg), lupenone (4b, 80 mg), a-amirenone (2b, 27 mg), /J-amirenone (XI, 23 mg) and germanicone (Jc, 39 mg).     
R' A2group. The "C NMR data supported the assignments of two carbinolic carbons (668.02 and 60.90, ioides, C. sphaerospermum and Colletotrichum gloesporioirespectively). As expected, all the 13CNMR assignments des and proved to correspond to the R, 0.22 zone. Caffeic are completely consistent with the proposed structures. acid and other hydroxycinnamic esters are reported toThe caffeic acid esters lb and c, as well as the parent have an important function as protection against herbicompound la were submitted to bioassay; lc inhibited vores and pathogens[9]. The occurrence of la-c in the the growth of Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium cladospor-leaves of A. macrophylla would account for its fungitoxic properties.

Coupling constants (Hz) are given in parentheses. 2091 The triterpenes 2a, b, 3a-42, 4a, b were isolated after preparative thin layer chromatography of the hexane solubles obtained from the acetone extract of the stems of A. mucrophylla. Their identifications were based on the comparison of physical and spectral data, mainly t3CNMR 6 values, with the values reported in the literature for a-amyrin, r-amyrenone, /3-amyrin, /I?-amyrenone, germanicone, lupeol and htpenone [l&13] respectively. EXPERIMENTAL Plant material. Alibertia macrophylla was collected in the Estafio Ecologica e Experimental de Magi-Guacu (SP), by Dr M. C. M. Young and identified by Dr Z. L. Jung-Mendacolli (Instituto de Botinica, .Sgo Paulo). Extraction and isolation of constituents. Dried and powdered leaves (314g) of A. macrophylla were extracted with 40% EtOH-HzO. The extract, dissolved in MeGH-Hz0 (9: 1) was partitioned into n-hexane, HCCI, and EtOAc. The EtOAc solubles (2 g) were resolved by CC (silica gel. HCCI,-MeOH, increasing polarity) into 22 frs. lb (23 mg) was separated from frs l-2 by prep. TLC [silica gel, n-hexancEtOAc (1: l)+O.S% HOAc]. Fr. 11 submitted to prep. TLC (silica gel, CHCI,-EtzO, 3: 1) yielded la (6.5 mg). Frs 12-18 after prep. TLC [silica gel, CHCI,-MeOH (7: 3) + 2% HOAc] afforded lc (12 mg).
