IntroductionStyrax camporum Pohl (Styracaceae), known in Brazil as ''estoraque do campo'' or ''cuia de brejo'', grows in the States of Sa˜o Paulo and Minas Gerais and is popularly used in gastrointestinal diseases [1]. Its reported uses have led to a study of the composition and antiulcer activity of the crude extract of the bark and the trunk [2]. Previous phytochemical investigation of the bark of S. camporum has resulted in the isolation of homoegonol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, sitosterol, vanillin and esters of cinnamic and ferulic acids [3]. The present article deals with the isolation from stems of S. camporum, and the identification and cytotoxicity evaluation of two benzofuran lignans, egonol (1) and homoegonol (2), and one furofuran lignan, (AE)syringaresinol (3), originally isolated from Styrax obassia [4,5] and Forsythia intermedia [6], respectively. Lignans are known to possess several biological activities [7][8][9][10][11], including antitumor, e.g., some podophyllotoxin derivatives, currently in clinical use, and cytotoxic, e.g., the benzofuran lignan licarin A which is active against KB cells. In order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of compounds 1-3 against C6, Hep-2 and HeLa human carcinoma cells, the MTT spectrophotometric assay was used.
Experimental
Plant materialThe stems of S. camporum Pohl were collected in Campininha Farm, Mogi-Guac¸u, SP, Brazil, by M.C.M. Young in November 1995. A voucher specimen (Young 07 -SP) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil.
General experimental proceduresOptical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer. 1 H, 13 C-NMR, DEPT and COSY spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 or DMSO-D 6 using TMS as internal standard on a Bruker AC 200 or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS, on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. CC was performed over silica gel 60, 70-230 or 230-400 mesh or Sephadex LH-20 (Merck). TLC analysis was carried out on silica gel 60 F 254 plates with detection provided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and/or by spraying with 2% anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent followed by heating.
Extraction and isolationThe dried and powdered stems of S. camporum (470.0 g) were extracted with a 2 : 1 v/v mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH. The extract was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue (57.2 g) was taken up in aqueous MeOH (MeOH-H 2 O 80 : 20; 200 mL) and subsequently extracted with hexane. Sufficient water was added to the aqueous methanol fraction to make it up to 60% aqueous MeOH, which was extracted with CHCl 3 followed by EtOAc. The CHCl 3 fraction (3.8 g) was loaded onto a column packed with silica gel 60 and eluted with hexane-EtOAc 1 : 1 v/v (A), CHCl 3 (B), EtOAc (C), CHCl 3 -CH 3 OH 1 : 1 v/v (D), MeOH (E) and H 2 O (F) (300 mL each). After evaporation, fraction A (370 mg) was subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel eluted with CHCl 3 -MeOH (98 : 2) and 62 fractions (15 mL each) were collected. Combined fraction 6-15 afforded 1 (34. 
Cytotoxicity assayCellular viability in the presence and absence of test compounds was determined using the standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; Sigma, Dorset, U.K.) microculture assay [12]. A mitochondrial dehydrogenase reduces MTT to a blue formazan product with an absorbance at 560 nm in DMSO. Cells harvested in the log phase of the growth were counted and seeded (5 Â 10 4 cells/well in 1 mL) in 48-well microtiter plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37 C under 4.3% CO 2 to allow cell attachment, cultures of the Hep-2 (larynx epidermoid carcinoma), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines were treated with several test compound concentrations. Three replicate wells were set up for each experimental condition. After another 24 h incubation period, MTT (100 mL of a 5 mg/mL solution) was added, the plate was incubated for 3 h and unreduced MTT was removed. Acid isopropanol (HCl 0.3%; 100 mL) was added to dissolve the blue formazan. The absorbance at 560 nm was read by using a Pharmacia LKB-Ultrospec III spectrophotometer. The IC 50 value was defined as the concentration of test compound Cytotoxic lignans from the stems of S. camporum 3 mg, CHCl 3 -MeOH 96 : 4, R f 0.26) and the combined fraction 17-18 afforded 2 (11.7 mg, CHCl 3 -MeOH 96 : 4, R f 0.50). Fraction C (630 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 19 fractions (10 mL each) were collected. Combined fractions 2-7 (363 mg) were rechromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH and 52 fractions (3 mL each) were collected. Purification of the combined fractions 31-41 (98 mg) by prep. TLC (eluent CHCl 3 -MeOH 92 : 8) yielded 3 (5.1 mg, CHCl 3 -MeOH 320 H.L. Teles et al. Downloaded by [University of California Santa Cruz] at 17:19 28 November 2014 85 : 15, R f 0.61). All known compounds were identified with the help of UV, IR, MS and NMR, including COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments.
