Two novel dihydrochalcones, 2 ',3,4',6'-tetrahydroxy-4-methoxy-3',5-di-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-dihydrochalcone and 2',.3,6'-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-5-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-3',4'-(2",2"-dimethyldihydropyran)-dihydroch~cone, have been isolated from fresh fruits of Metrodorea nigra. Stems and leaves showed a similar composition and we have isolated common steroids, simple coumarins, several furocoumarins, furoquinoline alkaloids and a furofuran lignan. From stems, we have also isolated the pentacyclic 6-C-monoterpenyl-5,7-dioxycoumarin, deoxybruceol. Structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectral data.

INTRODUCTIONThe genus Metrodorea, belonging to the tribe Cusparieae, is considered to contain ca eight species, which are confined to Brazil [ 1,2]. There are, as yet, no reports of any chemical studies on Metrodorea species. Thus, as part of our ongoing phytochemical and chemotaxonomic study on members of the Cusparieae, we have examined fresh fruits, leaves and stems of M. nigra. This species, commonly known as wild orange, is a small tree of l-2 m high. We report here in the isolation and characterization of two new dihydrochalcones, along with known coumarins, anthranilate alkaloids, lignans and steroids.
RESULTSANDDISCUSSIONThe fresh fruits of M. nigra were percolated with methanol. The chloroform-soluble fraction of the methanol extract was concentrated and subjected to VLC. Apolar and polar fractions were composed mainly by triacyl glycerols and condensed tannins, respectively. From the medium polar fractions, after prep. TLC, we obtained two novel C-prenylated dihydrochalcones. Compound 1 exhibited similar spectral data to 2 ',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxy-3,5-di-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-dihydr~halcone (6), which has previously been isolated from Boronia inconspicua (Rutaceae) 133. The 'H NMR spectrum (Table l), instead of signals for meta-coupled A-ring protons, *Based in part on the doctorate thesis presented by the senior author to the Universidade Federal de Sgo Carlos, SP, Brazil (1994).SAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed.showed one 1H singlet at 6 5.80. This signal and the mass spectral fragment at m/z 220 [C12H1204]+, due to fission of the propanone bridge between the C = 0 and the C-a, established the presence of a 3,3-dimethylallyl group at C-3'/C-5'. The signal at 65.80 was thus assigned to H-S/H-3'. This was supported by comparison with the spectral data published for 5,7,2',4'-tetrahydroxy-6,5'-di-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-flavanone, isolated from Euchresta ja- ponica (Leguminosae) [4]. The 'HNMR also showed a B-ring spin-system for 3,4,5_substitution, as in 6, and a signal for a methoxyl group. However, for 1, H-6 (66.67) was more deshielded than that at H-2 (66.54) and, in the 13C NMR spectrum, the deshielded position of the methoxyl resonance at Sc61.2 (q) required an ortho-disubstituted carbon [5], thus placing the methoxyl substituent at C-4, the hydroxyl substituent at C-3 and the 3,3_dimethylallyl substituent at C-5. This was corroborated by the mass fragment m/z 218 [C14HIs02]+. Thus, 1 was identified as 2',3,4',6'-tetrahydroxy-4-methoxy-3',5di-(3,3-dimethylallyI)-dihydrochalcone.Compound 2 was isolated in small amounts. The 'H NMR spectrum (Table 1) was similar to that of 1 for the A and B-ring protons, consequently, the same substitution pattern was deduced for 2. However, the 'H NMR spectrum also indicated the presence of one 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran ring (61.36, 6H, s; 1.80, 2H, t, J = 6.6 Hz and 2.58, 2H, t, .I = 6.6 Hz). These observations can be explained only by the presence of a 2,2_dimethyldihydropyran ring between C-3' and O-4'. This was confirmed by the mass fragment at m/z 220 (C12HI,0,] + as found in 1. Thus, 2 was identified as 2',3,6'-trihydroxy-4methoxy-5-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-3',4'-(~,~-dimethyldihydropyran)-dihydrochalcone.However, compound 2 could be an artefact formed from 1 during isolation.  5) [19]. and a mixture of /I-sitosterol and stigmasterol. These compounds were identified by comparison of their spectral data with those reported in the literature. Isogospherol (3), a &modified Oprenylated linear furocoumarin previously isolated from Prungos lophopteru (Umbelliferae) [lS], does not appear to have previously been recorded from the Rutaceae. Also, this appears to be the first record of deoxybruceol (4), a pentacyclic 6-C-monoterpenyl-5,7-dioxycoumarin, from the tribe Cusparieae, but it has been reported from Eriostemon brucei (tribe Boronieae) [16, 173. The furoquinoline alkaloids, Z-and E-dimethylrhoifolinate (S), have been reported previously by us from another Braz- Extraction and isolation. Fresh fruits (110 g) were chopped into small pieces and percolated with MeOH. The residue was dried and extracted with CHC13 at room temp. This extract (2.5 g) was shown to be composed of satd hydrocarbons and triacylglycerols. The MeOH extract (10 g) was suspended in 50% aq. MeOH and partitioned between CHC13, EtOAc and n-BuOH. The CHCl,-sol. fr. (2.2 g) was submitted to VLC over silica gel 60 H using CH,Cl*-MeOH mixts of increasing polarity and, after combination, monitored by TLC, furnished 5 frs (A-E). Fr.

EtOAc (0.2 g) and n-BuOH (0.8 g) frs were composed mainly of sugars.Stems (284 g) were ground and percolated with hexane, CHC13 and MeOH, respectively.
