Dammarane triterpenes from Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. (Meliaceae): Their chemosystematic significance
The stem of Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. yielded three new dammarane triterpenes 20S,24S-epoxy-7b,25-dihydroxy-3,4secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid, 20S,24S-epoxy-7b,15a,25-trihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid and 20S,24R-epoxy-7b,22x,25-trihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid, which were identified on the basis of spectroscopic methods. The known dammarane triterpenes ocotillone, eichlerianic acid, shoreic acid and the sterols sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, sitostenone and stigmast-5-en-3-one were also isolated and identified. The branches yielded the above three known dammaranes and eichlerialactone. The dammaranes in C. canjerana display strong similarities with Trichilieae tribe, which contains several dammaranes. The data reported herein thus provide firm support for placing Cabralea within the subfamily Melioideae, Trichilieae tribe.

IntroductionThe Meliaceae is a medium-sized family of woody plants of the tropics and subtropics of both hemispheres, comprising 51 genera and probably no more than 550 species. Harms (1940) divided the Meliaceae into three subfamilies in the following way: Cedreloideae (two tribes: Cedreleae and Ptaeroxyleae), Swietenioideae and Melioideae (five tribes: Carapeae, Turraeeae, Vavaeeae, Melieae and Trichilieae). Pennington and Styles (1975) excluded Ptaeroxyleae from the family, included Harms' tribes Cedreleae and Carapeae into the subfamily Swietenioideae and divided Harms' tribe Trichilieae into four tribes, Trichilieae, Aglaieae, Guareeae and Sandoriceae.Chemically, the family Meliaceae is distinguished by the frequent occurrence of limonoids, whose precursor degrades to four major routes, oxidative opening of ring D to give the D-seco limonoids, of ring B and D to give the mexicanolide types, of ring B and A to give the A,B-seco limonoids and of ring C to give the C-seco limonoids or Nimbin group (da Silva et al., 1984(da Silva et al., , 1987)). The mexicanolide group occurs widely in the genera of the Swietenioideae. The Melioideae appears to be the most prolific in production of A,B-seco limonoids but relatively poor in mexicanolide types. The C-seco limonoids have so far been recorded in four genera of the Melioideae (Turrea, Trichilia, Melia, and Azadirachta). Chemically, the Swietenioideae and Melioideae are clearly distinguished. The difference in composition of the limonoids in Harms' tribe Trichilieae is not pronounced enough to corroborate Pennington and Styles' separation of the genera into four tribes (da Silva et al., 1984(da Silva et al., , 1987)). Thus, expansion of knowledge on Trichilieae, Aglaieae, Guareeae and Sandoriceae is necessary, particularly to support Pennington and Styles' suggestion. As part of a continuing study of the chemistry of the Meliaceae we have examined branches and stem of previously uninvestigated Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. in order to obtain phytochemical evidence permitting a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Harms' tribe Trichilieae or Guareeae.

Plant materialC. canjerana was collected in Federal University of Vic ¸osa, MG, Brazil, and identified by T. D. Pennington, from the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew-UK. A voucher (1842;1983) is deposited in the Herbarium of Departamento de Engenharia Floresta, Dendrologia, Universidade Federal de Vic ¸osa, MG, Brazil.
Isolation of compoundsGround branches (228 g) and stem (1.5 kg) from C. canjerana were extracted with hexane, then CH 2 Cl 2 and finally with MeOH at room temperature for three times. The concentrated hexane extract from branches was subjected to CC over silica gel (230e400 mesh). Elution from hexane to EtOAc yielded ocotillone (16.6 mg) and a mixture of 4 and 5 (35.8 mg). The concentrated CH 2 Cl 2 extract from branches was subjected to CC over silica gel (230e400 mesh). Elution with hexaneeEtOAc gradient yielded 11 frs. Fr.4 was rechromatographed as above, eluting with hexaneeMe 2 CO to afford a mixture of 4 and 5 (15.3 mg). Fr. 8 was twice rechromatographed over silica gel (230e400 mesh, hexanee Me 2 CO 20:7; hexaneeMe 2 CO 20:5) yielding eichlerialactone (3.0 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract from branches was purified by repeated column chromatography as above to give ocotillone (41.0 mg) and a mixture of 4 and 5 (10.3 mg).The concentrated CH 2 Cl 2 extract from the stem was subjected to CC over silica gel (230e400 mesh). Elution with hexaneeCH 2 Cl 2 eMe 2 CO gradient yielded ocotillone (40.0 mg), a mixture of 4 and 5 (12.3 mg) and an amorphous solid characterized by GCeMS and 13 C NMR as a mixture (313 mg) of sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, sitostenone and stigmast-5-en-3-one. The concentrated MeOH extract from the stem was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel (70e230 mesh) using a hexaneeCH 2 Cl 2 eEtOAceMeOH gradient giving four frs, fr-hexane, fr-CH 2 Cl 2 , fr-EtOAc and fr-MeOH. Fr-EtOAc was subjected to CC over silica gel (230e400 mesh). Elution with hexaneeCH 2 Cl 2 eMe 2 CO gradient yielded 14 frs. Fr-EtOAc-3 was rechromatographed as above to afford 1 (15.1 mg). Fr-EtOAc-5 was rechromatographed as above to afford ocotillone (25.6 mg) and additional frs. Fr-EtOAc-5-3 was twice rechromatographed as above yielding, after final purification by lobar column (MERCK, hexaneeCH 2 Cl 2 eMe 2 CO gradient), compound 3 (7.0 mg). Fr-EtOAc-5-6 was rechromatographed as above, eluting with hexaneeMe 2 CO to afford ocotillone (160 mg), a mixture of 4 and 5 (43 mg) and a fr. containing 2. The last fr. was then rechromatographed as above yielding, after final purification by lobar column (MERCK, hexaneeCH 2 Cl 2 e Me 2 CO gradient), compound 2 (3.0 mg).2. 3.1. 20S,24S-epoxy-7b,25-dihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic 
Results and discussionA methanol extract of the stem of C. canjerana afforded three new dammarane triterpenes 1e3, in addition to the known 20S,24R-epoxy-25-hydroxydammar-3-one (ocotillone) (Rao et al., 1975a), 20S,24R-epoxy-25-hydroxy-3,4secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (4, shoreic acid) and 20S,24S-epoxy-25-hydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (5, eichlerianic acid) (Roux et al., 1998). Compound 1 showed the spectral characteristics of a 20,24-epoxy-25-hydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (as 5, eichlerianic acid) (Tanaka and Yahara, 1978;Lavie et al., 1984;Roux et al., 1998;Qiu et al., 2001). The HREI-mass spectrum indicated the molecular formula as C 30 H 50 O 5 (m/z 490.3658) showing that 1 differed from 5 (C 30 H 50 O 4 ) only by an additional oxygen. The IR spectrum showed the presence of hydroxyl (3448 cm ÿ1 ) Resonances were confirmed by HSQC and HMBC. Spectra of 1 run in C 5 D 5 N and of 2e5 in CDCl 3 at 400 MHz. 4 and 5 (Roux et al., 1998).  1) revealed an oxymethine at d 4.05, dd, J ¼ 11.2 and 4.2 Hz. The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 1, permitted the assignments of all hydrogen and carbon atoms of the 20,24-epoxy-25hydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic system (Table 2) in close agreement with those for 5. From HMBC experiments (Table 3), the correlation observed between the 1 H signals for H-28a (d 4.95)  ) confirming the presence of a side chain of the same type as that of eichlerianic acid (5). In the NOEDIFF experiments (Table 3) irradiation of the H-24 signal did not influence Me-21, showing NOEs only to Me-27 (or Me-26). These observations suggested the H-24 to be anti (a) to Me-21 (b). Moreover, compound 1 was characterized as 20S,24S-epoxy-7b,25-dihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid from the chemical shift of C-24 (d C 87.4; d H 3.96, dd, J ¼ 10.3 and 5.0 Hz) and its comparison with those of 20S,24Sepoxy-25-hydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (5, eichlerianic acid, d C 86.2; d H 3.62, dd, J ¼ 10.0 and 5.5 Hz), and 20S,24R-epoxy-25-hydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (4, shoreic acid, d C 83.1; d H 3.71, t, J ¼ 7.7 Hz) (Hisham et al., 1996;Roux et al., 1998). The assignment of the relative configuration of C-7 received further support between NOE of the H-7 and H 3 -30, supporting that hydroxyl group is thus in an equatorial configuration (b) (Table 3).The HR-mass spectra of 2 and 3 indicated the molecular formula as C 30 H 50 O 6 (m/z 506.3607), showing that both differed from 1 (C 30 H 50 O 5 ) only by an extra oxygen. The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 2 and 3 permitted the assignments of all hydrogen and carbon atoms (Table 2) in close agreement with those for 1. In addition to signals typical of 1, the 1 H NMR spectrum of 2 (Table 1) revealed an oxymethine at d 4.06, t, J ¼ 8.8 Hz. From HMBC experiments (Table 3), the observed correlation between the signal at d 0.98, assigned to H 3 -30 (d C 9.4), and the 13 C signal at d 72.2 determined the position of a hydroxyl group at C-15. The C-15 signal (d 72.2) showed one-bond correlation with the 1 H signal at d 4.06, which was attributed to H-15. The stereochemistry suggested for 2 was based on the biosynthesis of dammarane (da Silva et al., 1984(da Silva et al., , 1987)), moreover, these were supported by the NOESY and NOE-DIFF experiments (Table 3). The NOEs of the H-15 at d 4.06, coming from H 3 -18, showed that the hydroxyl group at C-15 is thus in the a-face of the molecule. Thus, the structure of the new dammarane was characterized as 20S,24Sepoxy-7b,15a,25-trihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (2).In compound 3, the HR-mass spectrum showed a significant fragment ion at m/z 159.1001, C 8 H 15 O 3 , assuming hydroxyl group to be located in the side chain. In addition to signals typical of 1, the 1 H NMR spectrum of 3 (Table 1) revealed an oxymethine at d 4.07, t, J ¼ 5.8 Hz. From HMBC experiments (Table 3), the correlations observed between the signals at d 3.65, assigned to H-24 (d C 81.7), d 1.16, assigned to H-21 (d C 19.2), and the 13 C signal at d 75.6 determined the position of a hydroxyl group at C-22. Furthermore, the shielded resonance observed for C-24 in compound 3 (d C 81.7; d H 3.65, t, J ¼ 7.3 Hz) is not typical of 1 and 5, but of 4 (4, shoreic acid, d C 83.1; d H 3.71, t, J ¼ 7.7 Hz) (Hisham et al., 1996;Roux et al., 1998). The slightly negative g effect of the hydroxy group at C-22 caused an upfield shift for C-24 in 3, when compared with 4. The NOESY and NOEDIFF experiments (Table 3) did not facilitate elucidation of the relative configuration of C-22 and C-24. However, the data were consistent with the structure of 20S, 24R-epoxy-7b,22x,25-trihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (3).The dichloromethane extract of the stem yielded ocotillone (Rao et al., 1975a), a mixture of 4 and 5 and a mixture of sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, sitostenone and stigmast-5-en-3-one. The hexane and methanol extracts of the branches afforded ocotillone and a mixture of 4 and 5. The dichloromethane extract of the branches also afforded a mixture of 4 and 5 and eichlerialactone (Rao et al., 1975b).
ConclusionCabralea is known to contain D-seco limonoids (seeds: gedunain, 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin, 7-deacetoxy-7hydroxygedunin, 7-deacetoxy-7-hydroxyphotogedunin; Rao et al., 1975b), B,D-seco limonoids (seeds: methyl angolensate; Rao et al., 1975b), mexicanolides (seeds: fissinolide, 3-deacetyl fissinolide, cabralin and isocabralin;Zelnik, 1971;Rao et al., 1975b;wood: fissinolide;Rao et al., 1975a) and dammarane triterpenes (seeds: cabraleone and cabraleadiol; Rao et al., 1975b;fruits: cabraleone, cabraleadiol, cabralealactone and cabraleahydroxylactone;Cascon and Brown, 1972; wood: cabraleone, ocotillone, cabraleadiol, cabralealactone and cabraleahydroxylactone, eichlerianic acid, shoreic acid, dammarenolic acid and eichlerialactone; Rao et al., 1975a). Cabralea appears to produce limonoid types from the common precursor along only one pathway to mexicanolides (limonoids with intact carbon skeleton / D-seco / B,D-seco limonoids / mexicanolides). Thus, the known limonoids from Cabralea are typical of the Swietenioideae subfamily (da Silva et al., 1984(da Silva et al., , 1987)). On the other hand, the dammarane triterpenes do not    (Shiengthong et al., 1974) 5a-Dammar-20-ene-3b,24,25-triol 20 3b, 24R, 25 Aglaia odorata (Boar and Damps, 1977) 24,25-Dihydroxy-dammar-20-en-3-one 20 24R, 25 seem to be common in the genera of Swietenioideae, but have been found frequently in those of Melioideae, being restricted to the Harms' tribe Trichilieae (Tables 4 and5). As already mentioned, the difference in composition of the limonoids in Harms' tribe Trichilieae is not pronounced enough to corroborate Pennington and Styles' separation of the genera into four tribes. This interpretation receives additional support from dammarane triterpenes (Tables 4 and5), if indeed the data of five genera justify any comment. As a result of this study Cabralea has been shown to be prolific in production of dammaranes but relatively poor in limonoids, reinforcing its position in the subfamily Melioideae, Harms' tribe Trichilieae.

Hz), which was coupled to the 1 H signals at d 2.26 (td, J ¼ 13.1, 11.2 Hz) and 1.86 m, and both of which were also coupled to the oxymethine signal at d 4.05 (dd, J ¼ 11.2 and 4.2 Hz), thus indicating a hydroxyl group at C-7 (d C 72.9 by HSQC) and permitting the assignment of the above signals to H-5, H-6ax, H-6eq and H-7, respectively. These assignments were supported by TOCSY experiments. Orientation of the hydroxyl followed from the large coupling constant between H-7 and H-6ax at d 2.26 (td, J ¼ 13.1, 11.2 Hz) which requires H-7 to be in an axial conformation (a). The methyl proton at d 1.33 showed long-range correlations with the C-7 (d 72.9), C-9 (d 41.6) signals and the 13 C signals at d 46.1 and 50.3 (quaternaries), leading to their assignments as Hand H-28b (d 4.99) and the 13 Csignals at d 48.6 and 23.5 (CH and CH 3 , respectively, by DEPT 135) led to their assignments as C-5 and C-29, respec-tively. The methyl proton at d 0.95 (d C 20.7 by HSQC) showed long-range correlations with the C-5 signal and the 13 Csignals at d 35.4 (CH 2 ), 41.6 (CH) and 39.3 (quaternary), leading to their assignments as H 3 -19, C-1, C-9 and C-10,respectively. The C-1 signal (d 35.4) showed one-bond correlation with the 1 H signal at d 2.00 m (2H) and was coupledto the 1 H signals at d 2.71 (ddd, J ¼ 15.0, 11.5, 4.0 Hz) and 2.52 (ddd, J ¼ 15.0, 12.0, 6.0 Hz), and both of which alsoshowed cross peaks with the 13 C signal at d 29.2. These signals were then assigned to 2H-1, H-2a, H-2b and C-2, re-spectively. Moreover, the C-5 signal (d 48.6) showed one-bond correlation with the 1 H signal at d 2.40 (dd, J ¼ 13.1,2.83 -18, C-8 and C-14 (or C-14 and C-8), and confirming a hydroxyl group at C-7. A comparison of 13 C chemical shifts of dammaranes indicated that C-14 (ca d 50) resonates at a lower field than C-8 (ca d 46). The signals at d 46.1 and 50.3 were then assigned to C-8 and C-14, respectively. A second methyl proton at d 1.15 showed also long-range correlations with the C-8 and C-14 signals and the 13 C signals at d 35.6 (CH 2 ), which were assigned to H 3 -30 and C-15, respectively. The HR-mass spectrum gave a significant fragment at m/z 143.1064 (C 8 H 15 O 2
