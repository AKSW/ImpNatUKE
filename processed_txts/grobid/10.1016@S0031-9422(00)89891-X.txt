THE FLAVONES OF APULEIA LEIOCARPA*t
The wood of Apuleiu leiocurpu (Vog.) Macbr. (Leguminosae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae) yielded (+)-pinitol, &sitosterol and ten flavones. Three of these flavones are the known compounds ayanin (X), oxyayanin-A (VIIIa) and oxyayanin-B (IX). The constitutions of the seven new flavones, apulein (Ia), 5-O-demethylapulein (Ib), apuleisin (Va), apuleitrin (Via), apuleirin (Vie), apuleidin (VIIa) and 5-O-methyloxyayanin-A (VIIIb) were established. A structural proposal is also advanced for leiocarpin (XVI), a new pterocarpan isolated from the bark. The unusual oxygenation pattern of the flavones is discussed.

INTRODUCTIONApuleia leiocurpa (Vog.) Macbr. (= A. pruecox Mart.) (Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae) is a tree which may attain considerable proportions. The fine-textured durable yellow timber is highly appreciated for heavy construction, flooring, door frames, wheel-wright work, shafts of vehicles and fence posts.' The species occurs over a huge territory from Northern Argentine. Ducke cites also A. molaris Spr. ex Bth, which grows in the Amazon valley.2 More recently, however, the opinion prevails that the genus Apuleia Mart. is monotypic and that A. leiocarpa is the binomial to be retained. 3 We have compared, by TLC, extracts of different parts of specimens of A. molaris, collected near BelCm, Para State, and classified by the botanist J. MurGa Pires, and of A. Zeiocarpa, collected near Brasilia, D. F., and classified by the botanist E. P. Heringer, and were unable to detect any difference in chemical composition.The trunk of the last mentioned specimen was separated into heartwood, sapwood and bark, which were extracted separately. By a combination of fractional crystallization and column chromatography (+)-pinitol, j?-sitosterol and nine flavones were isolated from the heartwood extract. A tenth flavone was shown to be present by TLC. The same flavones and p-sitosterol were also detected in the sapwood extract. The composition of the bark extract, however, was found to be different. Instead of the flavones, a new pterocarpan and /3sitosterol were present.

Counting the number of the methoxyl groups of the derivatives by NMR spectroscopy revealed that five compounds were heptaoxygenated, while three were hexaoxygenated and one was pentaoxygenated.
Heptaoxygenated FlavonesTwo of the heptaoxygenated flavones yielded an identical methyl ether. A hydroxylmethoxyl count revealed that one of the parent compounds, for which we propose the name apulein, is a dihydroxypentamethoxyflavone (Table 1, Compound Ia), and the other one is a trihydroxytetramethoxyflavone (Table 1, Compound Ib). The hydroxylproton signals in the NMR spectra of apulein (2.00 and 4.55~) and of the trihydroxyflavone (-2.28, 2.13 and 4.67~) indicated not only that a pair of OH groups may be situated in identical environments in both compounds, but also that the additional hydroxyl in the latter compound must be strongly chelated. The structure of 5-O-demethylapulein had thus to be considered for this compound. Aq. HCI promotes selective demethylation of 5-methoxyl groups in flavones4 and the use of this reagent to convert apulein to the trihydroxy derivative confirmed their structural relationship.The two remaining hydroxyls must be located in different environments, the one represented by a proton signal at about 27 (Table I, Compounds Ia and b) being involved in a weak intramolecular hydrogen bond. Since a hydroxyl at position 3 gives rise to a proton signal at about 0*5~,~ the OH group in question was placed at C-2', where it would be  subjected to the polarizing influence of the heterocyclic oxygen. This seemed reasonable, if considered in conjunction with evidence pointing to the presence of the other hydroxyl at the para position: The UV spectrum of apulein is not altered upon addition of AlCl3, H3B03 or NaOAc,6 but revealed that decomposition of the substance takes place upon addition of NaOH.A preliminary indication of the localization of the four methoxy groups in the partial structures of apulein (IIa) and 5-O-demethylapulein (IIb) was obtained by mass spectrometry. The well known fragmentation mode, through compensated displacement of electrons in the heterocycle,7*8 led to ions (Table 2, Compounds Ia and Ib) whose mass revealed the presence of two of these methoxyls in ring A, while the third one must be located either on the heterocycle or, together with the fourth one, on ring B. These assignments, however, are somewhat ambiguous. Not only are the pertinent ions of low relative abundance, but, as Table 2 also shows, fragments of identical mass may be formulated as arising either from ring A (ions V) or ring B (ions X). Confirmation was secured through the more reliable information contained in Table 3. Loss of 43 mass units from the molecular ion, as featured in the reactions M+ 0 + S and M + S, is typical of 3-methoxyflavones.9 Since at this stage the presence of a hydroxyl at position 2' had already been ascertained, the highly favoured losses of 17 (M --f P) and of 31 mass units (M + R) were to be expectedlO and constitute additional evidence for the presence of a methoxyl group at C-3.6 L.Mass spectral analysis thus authorized the expansion of the partial formula Ha and b respectively to IIIa and b. The proton signals in the aromatic region of the NMR spectra of all apulein derivatives (Table 1, Compounds Ia-e) were represented by singlets, indicating the absence of ortho or meta related aromatic hydrogens. This fact assigned the methoxyl of ring B to position 4'. The NMR signals at 2.7 and 3.4~ had, consequently. to be correlated with the protons at C-6' and C-3'. The resonance frequency of the remaining aromatic proton, however, was compatible with its presence either at C-6 or at C-8, and thus was not immediately helpful to decide unequivocally between two structural alternatives.Definite proposals concerning the structures of apulein and of 5-0-demethylapulein could be advanced only after degradation experiments. Alkaline hydrolysis of apulein led to a mixture of 6'-hydroxy-2,2',3',4'-tetramethoxyacetophenone and of 6-hydroxy-2,3,4trimethoxybenzoic acid. These fragments must correspond to ring A, since under the conditions ring B must have been destroyed. The substitution pattern of ring B could be defined after alkaline degradation of di-0-ethylapulein which led, in addition to the previous fragments, to 4-methoxy-2,5-diethoxybenzoic acid. Di-0-methylapulein, when submitted to the reaction, yielded, 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid. All these degradation products were characterized by physical and spectrometric means and by direct comparison with authentic samples. Clearly, they not only defined the localization of all oxygen functions, but also corroborated the assumption that the compounds are flavones. Accordingly, apulein must be 2 ',4',5,6, and 5-0-demethylapulein must be 2 ',5,4',6,.Once the structures of the apuleins had been established, it became necessary to reinterpret an experimental fact which did not fit the 5,6,7-oxygenation pattern for the apuleins. Nitric acid is known to effect oxidative demethylations leading to para-quinones" and treatment of apulein and of 5-0-demethylapulein with this reagent led to a single red quinone. This was reduced to a quinol which was acetylated without purification. NMR spectrometry revealed the product to be the trimethoxytetraacetoxyflavone of structure Ie, since a signal at relatively low field places one of the four acetyl groups at C-5 of the flavone skeleton.12 Treatment of apulein and of 5-0-demethylapulein with nitric acid thus afforded the quinone IV and it must be concluded that nitric acid produces not only para, but also ortho-quinones. A reaction of this type, involving chromic oxide-acetic acid as the reagent, has been reported .l 3The oxygenation pattern of apuleisin, a third heptaoxygenated flavone of Apuleiu leiocarpa, differs from the pattern of the apuleins only with respect to ring B. Indeed, the fully 0-methylated derivative of this tetrahydroxytrimethoxyflavone yielded, upon treat-ment with alkali, 2,3,4-trimethoxybenzoic acid, besides the 6'-hydroxy-2,2',3',4'-tetramethoxyacetophenone which had also been obtained upon degradation of the apuleins. The ortho relationship of the two ring B protons which was thus indicated, could also be appreciated through examination of the NMR spectrum of apuleisin (Table 1, Compound Va) which shows two ortho split doublets at 2.76 and 3.26 7.As in 5-Q-demethylapulein, two of the free hydroxyls in apuleisin must occupy positions 5 and 2', since their protons also gave rise to NMR signals respectively at -2.24 and 2.027. Both these hydroxyls form part of ortho-dihydroxy systems. This was ascertained by heating apuleisin with dichlorodiphenylmethane. As indicated by mass spectrometry (Tables 2, and3,  Compound Vd), a diphenylmethylenedioxydihydroxy trimethoxyflavone resulted. The two hydroxyls of this derivative form an ortho-quinol function involving the hydroxyl at C-5, since the compound is labile in alkali and originates a PMR signal at -2.53 7 (Table 1, Compound Vd). On this evidence, the structure 2',3',5,6-tetrahydroxy-3,4',7-trimethoxyflavone (Va) is proposed for apuleisin.Apuleitrin and apuleirin, the fourth and fifth heptaoxygenated flavones of Apuleia Zeiocarpa, again yielded an identical methyl ether. Apuleitrin differs structurally from apuleisin (Va) only with respect to ring B. Indeed, while its mass spectrum (Tables 2 and3, Compound VTa) reproduces fully all peaks originating through fragmentation of ring A of apuleisin, alkaline degradation of tri-O-methylapuleitrin afforded 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid. The structure of this methyl ether must consequently be represented by VIb. Confirmation was obtained by direct comparison with 3,3',4',5,5',6,7-heptamethoxyflavone prepared by methylation of 3',5,5'-trihydroxy-3,4',6,7-tetramethoxyflavone (VIc) kindly supplied by Prof. P. R. Jefferies.14The mass spectral indication of the substitution of ring A in apuleitrin was confirmed by NMR and UV spectrometry. The existence of a chelated hydroxyl (-2.43 T, Table 1, Compound Via) and of an ortho-dihydroxy-system (positive shift in U.V. spectrum with borate) was easily demonstrated. At this point only the relative site of one hydroxyl and two methoxyls at positions 3', 4' and 5' remained to be established. The protons at C-2' and 6' of apuleitrin gave rise to a single NMR band at 2.64 7 (Table 1, Compound Via). In spite of this fact, ring B must be asymmetrically substituted, because the corresponding signals in the spectrum of tri-O-acetylapuleitrin were characterized by two distinct chemical shift values (Table 1, Compound VId). Only 3 ',5,4',5', can thus represent the structure of apuleitrin.Apuleirin is a dihydroxypentamethoxy derivative (Table 1, Compound Vie). Since the structure of its methyl ether VIb had already been determined, only the relative positions of the substituents remained to be established. NMR (Table 1, Compound Vie) and UV data (no shift with A1C13) showed the absence of hydroxyls from both the 3-and 5-positions. The NMR spectrum contains a two-proton singlet at 2.55 7 which can only be attributed to the hydrogens at C-2' and 6'. The magnetic equivalence of these protons does not persist in apuleirin acetate, since they are represented by two meta-split doublets in the spectrum of this derivative (Table 1, Compound VIf). Asymmetric substitution of ring B requires the presence of a hydroxyl at C-3'. The only alternative asymmetric substitution pattern, namely a 3',4'-dihydroxy-5'-methoxy grouping, could be ruled out, because apuleirin is stable in alkali and no alteration of its W spectrum was observed upon addition of H,BO,. Absence of a paramagnetic shift of the H-8 NMR signal upon acetylation, and a bathochromic shift of the UV band II upon addition of NaOAc,6 can only be rationalized if I4 P. R. JEFFERIE, J. R. KNOX and E. J. MIDDLETON , Australian J. Chem. 15,532 (1962).the remaining OH group is at C-6. The mass spectral data (Tables 2 and3) are in accord with the structure of 3',6-dihydroxy-3,4',5,5',7-pentamethoxyflavone (We) which was consequently assigned to apuleirin.
Hexaoxygenated FlavonesThe distribution of hydroxyls and methoxyls on the skeleton of apuleidin, one of the hexaoxygenated flavones, was determined by mass spectrometry (Table 3, Compound VIIa). The masses of ions of types T, U and V (Table 2, Compound VIIa) indicated the existence of a hydroxy-methoxylated A-ring, while the masses of the ions Y and 2 were compatible with a dihydroxy-methoxylated B-ring. The UV spectrum revealed the vicinal relationship of the two hydroxyls in ring B (spectral shifts with H,BO, and decomposition in NaOH). Consequently, when the characteristic bands at -2.46 and 1.95 7 were found in the NMR spectrum of apuleidin (Table 1, Compound VIIa), the location of the hydroxyls at positions 5 and 2',3' had to be considered. The same spectrum indicated also the presence of four aromatic protons in meta and ortho related pairs. The chemical shifts of the corresponding signals suggested their situation respectively on ring A and ring B. All these data lead to structure 2',3',5-trihydroxy-3,4',7-trimethoxyflavone (VIIa) for apuleidin.The fully 0-methylated derivatives of the two other hexaoxygenated flavones isolated from Apuleia leiocarpa were identical. Mass spectra characterized one of the parent compounds (Table 3, Compound VIIIb) as a dihydroxy tetramethoxyflavone and the other one (Table 3, Compound VIIIa) as a trihydroxytrimethoxyflavone. The NMR spectra indicated, through a proton signal at -2.35 7, the presence of a 5-OH group only in the trimethoxyflavone (Table 1, Compound VIIIa). This suggested again a 5-OMe/5-OH relationship and, indeed, the tetramethoxyflavone was easily converted into the trimethoxyflavone upon heating with aqueous HCl.UV, NMR (Table 1, Compound VIIIa) and mass spectral (Tables 2 and3, Compound VIEIa) measurements, as well as degradation by alkali (see Experimental), indicated that the 5-hydroxy-compound was 2',5,5'-trihydroxy-3,4',7-trimethoxyflavone (VIIIa) and the 5methoxy-compound 2',5 4',5,. VIHa is the structure of oxyayanin-A, a constituent of Distemonanthus benthamianus.15Jain et aLI6 synthesized 2',5,5'-trihydroxy-3,4',7-trimethoxyflavone (VIIIa) and found it to be different, by IR spectroscopy, from a sample of oxyayanin-A supplied by Prof. F. E. King, although they recorded close agreement in colour reactions, UV spectra and m.p. This, in addition to the fact that the reportedI procedure for the isolation of oxyayanin-A from Distemonanthus benthamianus included alkaline treatment which destroys VIIIa, forced the Indian workers to consider the structural proposal VIIIa advanced for the natural compound as erroneous,16,17 and stimulated Dreyer and Bertelli to suggest that a 2',6'disubstituted B-ring might be present in oxyayanin-A.18 Such a hypothesis would, of course, never have been formulated, had the authors been able to examine the NMR spectrum. This shows (Table 1, Compound VIIIa) two doublets whose chemical shifts and coupling constant allow correlation only with protons at C-6 and C-8, and two singlets revealing a pair of para related protons. These can only be placed on ring B, which must consequently be substituted at positions 2',4' and 5'. I5 F. E. KING, T. J. KING and P. J. STOKES, J. Chem. Sot. 4587 (1954). I6 A. C. JAIN, S. K. MATHUR and T. R. SESHADRI, Indian J. Chem. 4,365 (1966). I7 S. C. DANA, V. V. S. MURTI and T. R. SESHADRI, Zndian J. Chem. 7,110 (1969). " D. L. DREYER and D. J. BERTELLI , Tetrahedron 23,4607 (1967).We were able to identify the 5hydroxytlavone of Apuleia leiocarpa with oxyayanin-A by direct comparison (IR and UV spectra, TLC and mixed m.p.) with an authentic sample from Dr. T. J. King. Consequently, when Prof. T. R. Seshadri kindly informed us that he found our oxyayanin-A ex A, leiocarpa identical with his synthetic VIIIa, the structural proposal originally advanced for oxyayanin-A was established as correct, and the remaining question concerned only the nature of the sample which had been sent from Nottingham to Delhi.This problem was solved when it was found that oxyayanin-A, crystallized from ethyl acetate-light petroleum, ethyl acetate-benzene or methanol, gave an i.r. spectrum (in KBr) identical with that published by Seshadri et al. I6 for synthetic VIIIa. When oxyayanin-A, however, was dissolved in chloroform and the solvent removed by evaporation, the residue, although indistinguishable from oxyayanin-A by UV all other methods, gave rise to an IR spectrum (in KBr) identical to that published by Seshadri et a1?6 for the natural oxyayanin-A received from England.Distemonanthus benthamianus Baill. is an African timber closely akin to Apuleia leio- carpa. lg Interestingly, both species belong to monotypic genera. The finding of oxyayanin-A in A. leiocarpa stimulated the search for other constituents of D. benthamianus in the Brazilian species. Indeed, the presence in the corresponding extract of still another hexaoxygenated flavone, namely oxyayanin-B (IX): 5 could be demonstrated by TLC.
Pentaoxygenated FlavoneThe sole pentaoxygenated flavone isolated from A. leiocarpa was, at this stage, identified easily through spectral measurements (cf. Tables l-3, Compound X; Experimental) with yet another constituent of D. benthamianus, namely ayanin (X).""
Mass SpectraTable 4 summarizes some of the mass spectral data contained in Table 2. Clearly, the substitution at C-2' and 6' of 3-methoxyflavones can be recognized upon examination of the relative abundances of their M-l, M-17 and M-31 ions. Absence of substitution confers high stability to the molecular ion, favouring only the expulsion of a hydrogen atom. Substitution by hydroxyl favours the expulsion of OH and OMe radicals, while substitution by methoxyl favours expulsion only of OMe. 
LeiocarpinThe aromatic constituent of A. leiocarpa bark was classified as a pterocarpan by means of its very typical NMR21-Z3 and UV24 spectra. The mass spectrum suggested, through its molecular ion, substitution by a methylenedioxy-and a 2,2-dimethylchromene unit. The prominent M-15 peak was attributed to the benzopyrilium ion, formed by loss of a methyl radical from the chromene portion of the molecule. Direct assignment of the substituents to rings A or B of the pterocarpan skeleton through mass spectrometry was not feasable for, as shown previously, 8*25 the major fragments can be reasonably formulated as arising from either ring (e.g. XI, XII). As expected, however, the interpretation of the mass spectrum of the isoflavan, derived from leiocarpin by catalytic hydrogenation, was straightforward. The retro-Diels Alder fragmentation mode yielded the ions XIII and XIV in high relative abundance. The 2,Zdimethylchromane-group can thus be located only on ring A, while the methylenedioxy-group must occupy positions of ring B.The aromatic region of the NMR spectrum of the isoflavan showed four bands, each representing one proton : two doublets centered at 3.16 and 3.70 T (J 8.6 Hz) and two singlets at 3.31 and 3.49 T. Clearly, the chemical shift of the low field signal reveals the existence of a proton which keeps neither an orthonor apara relationship to an oxy-group,26 a condition which can be met only by a H at C-5 of a C-7-oxygenated A-ring. Since the proton signal under scrutiny is characterized by an ortho-coupling constant, a second H must occur at C-6. The ring B protons gave rise to two singlets and must be para related. Structure XV had consequently to be assigned to the tetrahydrogenated derivative of leiocarpin.The 3S-configuration for the isoflavan XV was deduced upon inspection of its ORD curve. This showed a negative Cotton effect in the 260-300 nm region, in analogy with the curves of known 3S-isoflavan?' which do not bear an additional substituent at C-6.25It was now possible to formulate structure and configuration of leiocarpin (XVI) on the reasonable assumption that the heterocyclic rings are cis fused.28 Confirmation of the structure was provided by all features of the NMR spectrum. Observed (3.31, 3.58~) and expected (3.40, 3.66~)~~ chemical shift values for the singlets due to the C-7 and C-10 protons are in agreement. Confirmation of the absolute configuration was obtained by inspection of the ORD curve. This followed, between 3.50 and 220 nm, precisely the course expected for 6aS,l IaS-pterocarpans.25v29
DISCUSSIONMethylation of the 4'-hydroxyl in preference to the 3'-hydroxyl is relatively rare in natural flavonoids.30 Two additional conspicuous examples are eupatin (XVIIa) and eupatoretin (XVIIb), not only on account of their close structural relationship with oxyayanin-B (IX), but also because they show moderate cytotoxicity against human carcinoma of the nasopharynx.  The postulated derivation of trioxygenated B-rings of Apuleia constituents from dioxygenated precursors is presented in Chart 2. It seems obvious that the hydroxyl, and not the methoxyl, controls the orientation of electrophyllic attack by +OH to its para or orihopositions. Effects of this nature were attributed to the ability of the hydroxyl groups to establish a hydrogen bond with the neighbouring methoxy gro~p.~~ As a result of such intramolecular hydrogen bonding, mesomeric and inductive electron release toward ortho or para positions would be expected to be enhanced for the hydroxyl, and repressed for the methoxyl. This may explain why the usual 4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy substituion in natural diarylpropanoids leads to the usual 3',4',5'-trioxygenated derivatives, while, at least in Distemonanthus and Apuleia species, the unusual 3'-hydroxyd'-methoxy substitution leads to the unusual 2',4',5'-and 2',3',4'-trioxygenation patterns.That the 3',4',5'-oxygenation pattern is indeed usual among flavonoids was again brought out in the present work with respect to apuleitrin (Via) and apuleirin (We). reported in the family. Nevertheless, recent papers17,36*37 mention 27 additional representatives of this class from members of the Acanthaceae, Datiscaceae, Labiatae, Meliaceae, Moraceae and Rutaceae. Their biosynthesis, however, does not necessarily follow the course which is suggested for the Apuleia constituents, and at least some of these compounds may be derived by some departure from the usual acetate-shikimate patbway.38Finally, it has been reported that ayan wood (Distemonanthus benthdmianus) may cause dermatitis due to the presence of oxyayanin-A and oxyayanin-B.39 Clearly, this is another indication designed to stimulate an investigation into the physiological activity of the constituents of garapa wood (Apuleia leiocarpa).EXPERIMENTAL NMR spectra were determined in CDC13 using TMS as an internal standard. M.ps were determined using a Kofler hot stage microscope and are uncorrected. Separations by column chromatography were carried out usine Merck KieselaelO~O5-0~20 mm. Merck's Kieselael G was used for TLC. During isolation processes the appropriate combination of fractions was determined by examination of their i.r. spectra and TLC behaviour. TLC plates were examined under UV illumination and after exposure to iodine vapour. The majority of NMR and mass spectral figures are given in Tables 123.
Isolafion of Apuleia ConstituentsBenzene extraction of the heartwood of A. leiocarpa. Isolation of ten/?avones and j-sitosterol. The powdered heartwood (5.0 kg) was continuously extracted with hot benzene. Upon partial evaporation of the solvent separated an oil which solidified by standing (Hi). Further concentration of the benzene solution produced a crystalline precipitate which was separated into an acetone insoluble (HZ) and an acetone soluble portion. The acetone soluble portion was chromatographed on silica giving fractions H3-Hs, in this order, by elution with benzene-AcOEt(l:l). Two more successive crops of crystals (H, and Hs) of the original benzene solution were collected. The remaining benzene solution was divided into two parts, Hg and Hro.Hi was washed with a small quantity of benzene, and freed from an insoluble portion by treatment with CHC13. The CHCI,-solution was evaporated. The residue, purified by passage of its methanol solution through a column of Sephadex LH-20 gelified with methanol, and recrystallizations from the same solvent, afforded apuleisin (Va, 530 mg).HZ was recrystallized from acetone yielding apulein (Ia, 1.5 g). H3 was recrystallized from benzene-AcOEt yielding oxyayanin-A (VIIIa, 160 mg). H4 was recrystallized from benzene yielding 5-O-demethylapulein (Ib, 180 mg). H5 was recrystallized from acetone yielding apulein (Ia, 900 mg). Hs was recrystallized from acetone yielding 5-O-methyloxyayanin-A (VIIIb, 140 mg). H, was recrystallized from acetone, purified by chromatography on silica, elution with benzene-AcOEt(1 :l), and recrystallization from methanol, yielding ayanin (X, 9 mg). Hs was recrystallized from ethanol yielding apuleisin (Va, 40 mg). Hg was evaporated. The ethanol soluble part of the residue was chromatographed on a polyamide column. Benzene-MeOH 12:l eluted a product in which the presence of oxyayanin-B (IX) was detected by TLC (silica CHCI,).H,,, was partially evaporated. An oil precipitated and was separated. Treatment of this oil with MeOH produced a crystalline mass which was shown by TLC to be composed of 5-O-demethylapulein (Ib), apuleisin (Va) and oxyayanin-A (VIIIa). The filtered MeOH solution was concentrated to a small volume and chromatographed through a column of Sephadex LH-20 gelified with MeOH. In order of elution were collected p-sitosterol (30 mg), a fraction which after recrystallization from AcOEt-light petroleum yielded apuleitrin (Via, 30 mg), and a fraction which after recrystallization from MeOH yielded ayanin (X, 25 mg).Further evaporation of benzene from the original H,,-solution afforded a second crop of oily precipitate which was again treated with MeOH. The crystals were collected and again shown by TLC to be composed of 5-O-demethylapulein (Ib), apuleisin (Va), and oxyayanin-A (VIIIa). The filtered MeOH solution was evaporated and the residue dissolved in CHCI,. This solution was extracted several times with cont. aqueous borax. The aqueous layers were united, washed with CHCI,, acidified with HCl and extracted with CHCI,. The CHCI,-solution was washed with water, dried, evaporated and the residue (1.9 g) chromatographed on silica (60 g). In order of elution with benzene-AcOEt were collected a fraction which 36 P C PARTHASARATHY, P. V. RADHAKRISHNAU, S. S. RATHI and K. VEUKATARAMAN, Indian J. Chem. 7, iol(1969). 37 T. R.

In the mother-liquor, which remained after the filtration of apuleitrin, the presence of oxyayanin-B (IX) was demonstrated by TLC.Ethanol extraction of the heartwood of A. leiocarpa. Isolation of (+)-pinitol. The ground wood, after extraction with hot benzene, see above, was continuously extracted with EtOH. Partial evaporation of the solvent produced a crystalline deposit which through recrystallization from EtOH yielded (+)-pinitol(72mg).Benzene extraction of the sapwood of A. leiocarpa. The powdered sapwood (10.0 kg) was continuously extracted with hot benzene. Upon removal of the solvent a residue (100 g) remained. Column or TLC revealed the presenceof apulein(Ia), 5-O-demethylapulein(Ib), oxyayanin-A(VIIIa), 5-0-methyloxyayanin-A (VITIb), apuleisin (Va), apuleitrin (Via), ayanin (X) and fl-sitosterol.Benzene extraction of the bark of A. leiocarpa. Isolation of h-sitosterol and Ieiocarpin (XVI). The powdered bark (1.2 kg) was continuously extracted with hot benzene.' Evaporation of the solvent yielded a residue (16 g), part of which (3 g) was chromatographed on silica (90 g).
