Antifungal amides from Piper hispidum and Piper tuberculatum
Piper hispidum and Piper tuberculatum accumulate amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties. The isolation and characterization of several representatives including two hitherto unreported amides were performed by chromatographic techniques and by analysis of spectroscopic data. The antifungal activity of each amide was determined by direct bioautography against Cladosporium sphaerospermum.

IntroductionVarious amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties have been isolated from Piperaceae species (Parmar, 1997). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal properties (Miyako et al., 1989). In a previous paper, we described the structure of the antifungal amide N-[7-(3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-hep tadienoyl]pyrrolidine isolated from the leaves of Piper hispidum H.B.K. (AleÂ cio et al., 1998).In this paper, we describe the isolation, structure elucidation and evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8-(3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide (1), 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14-trimetho xycinnamoyl)-Á 3 -pyridin-2-one (2) and also of eight known antifungal amides N-[3-(6 H -methoxy-3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenoyl]pyrrolidine (3), piperamine (4), N-(12,13,14-trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-Á 3 -pyridin-2-one (5), piplartine (6), piperine (7), Á a,bdihydropiperine (8), 5,6-dihydropiperlonguminine (9) and pellitorine (10). The amides isolated from stems of Piper hispidum (1, 3 and 4) and from seeds of Piper tuberculatum (2, 5±10) were active against the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermun as evaluated by direct bioauto graphy (Homans and Fuchs, 1970).
Results and discussionA CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH (2:1) extract of the stems of P. hispidum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, followed by HPLC puri®cation to aord the compounds 1, 3 and 4.Compound 1, has a molecular formula C 18 H 23 NO 3 as determined by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and of the 13 C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1640 (conjugated carbonyl group), 1620 (conjugated double bond), and 925 (methylenedioxyphenyl group) cm 1 . Its 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 3 H ,4 Hmethylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at 5.91 (2H, s), and four ole®nic protons which showed signals at 5.45 (1H, d, J 3,4 =12.0 Hz), 6.38 (1H, dd, J 4,3 and 4,5 =12.0 Hz), 7.24 (1H, dd, J 5,4 and 5,6 =12.0 Hz) and 5.94 (1H, dt, J 6,5 and 6,7 =12.0 and 7.0 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that both double bonds 0031-9422/00/$ -see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. P I I : S 0123456789Phytochemistry 55 (2000) 621±626 www.elsevier.com/locate/phytochem possess the Z con®guration (AleÂ cio et al., 1998;Shah et al. 1986). The assignments of these ole®nic protons were con®rmed by analysis of the 1 H± 1 H COSY spectrum and by comparison with the literature data (Shah et al., 1986). The irradiation at the frequencies of the H-3 and H-4 collapsed the signals of H-4 and of H-3 to a doublet and to a singlet, respectively. The assignments of methylenic protons H-8 at 2.62 (2H, t, J 8,7 =7.0 Hz) and H-7 at 2.46 (2H, m) were con®rmed by the DQ-COSY spectrum which showed mutual correlation between such protons. Additional correlation between signal assigned to the proton H-7 and to that of methine proton H-6 ( 5.94, 1H) could be also observed.The presence of a isobutyl moiety was con®rmed by the signals at 3.13 (2H, dd, J 1 HH ,2 HH =7.0 Hz), 1.80 (1H, m) and 0.92 (6H, d, J 3 HH ,2 HH and 4 HH ,2 HH =7.0 Hz) attributed to H-1 HH , H-2 HH , H-3 HH and H-4 HH , respectively. The coupling between H-1 HH and the NH hydrogen was con®rmed by exchange with D 2 O in the 1 H NMR experiment. The 13 C NMR data (Table 1) of 1 are in accordance with the proposed structure. The low-®eld region of the spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at 166.5, ten ole®nic and/or aromatic carbons, six saturated carbons [ C 46.7, 35.1, 34.9, 28.6 and 20.1(2x)], and a methylenedioxyphenyl group at 100.7. The assignments of the signals for the aromatic carbons are based on comparison with data described in the literature (AleÂ cio et al., 1998;ArauÂ jo-Junior et al. 1997) and indicated that a 3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxyphenyl moiety is present. The structure of 1 was determined as(3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8- (3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide.A CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH (2:1) extract from seeds of P. tuberculatum was fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel followed by preparative TLC to aord compounds 2 and 5±10.Compound 2, was shown to have a molecular formula C 17 H 19 NO 5 by analysis of electrospray mass spectrum (ES±MS) and of 13 C NMR data. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 1757 (conjugated carbonyl group), at 1615 (conjugated double bond) and at 1216 cm 1 (asymmetric C±O±C stretching). The 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 revealed the presence of methoxyphenyl groups by the signals at 3.84 (6H, s), 3.85 (3H, s), one aromatic proton signal at 6.76 (2H, s) which suggested a 12,13,14-trimethoxyphenyl group. Assignments of signals related to four ole®nic protons were determined based on analysis of DQCOSY spectrum. The spin systems derived from H-8, H-9 and H-3, H-4 were readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet at 6.48 assigned to H-8 (J 8,9 =12.4 Hz) which showed a cross-peak with the 1H doublet at 6.71 assigned to H-9 (J 9,8 =12.4 Hz). The coupling constant values indicated that this double bond possesses the Z con®guration. The attribution of this con®guration was corroborated by the shielded signals of H-8 and H-9 in the Z isomer when compared with the E isomer (Duh et al., 1990). The doublet of triplet (1H) at 5.98 (J 3,4 and 3,5 =9.7 and 1.9 Hz) assigned to H-3 showed correlation with H-4. The doublet of triplet (1H) at 6.89 (J 4,3 and 4,5 =9.7 and 4.3 Hz) assigned to H-4 showed a cross peak with the signal at 5.98 (J 3,4 and 3,5 =9.7 and 1.9 Hz) attributed to H-3 and with the multiplet centered at 2.40 attributed to H-5. This last proton also showed a correlation with the triplet at 3.97 (J 6,5= 7.0 Hz) assigned to H-6. The low-®eld region of the 13 C NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 exhibited signals assigned to six aromatic carbons, four ole®nic carbons, besides two carbonyl groups at 165.7 and 168.1. The assignments of the carbonyl groups were based on analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The signal at 168.1 was assigned to the carbonyl at C-7 based on its correlation with the proton signals at 6.48 (H-8) and 6.71 (H-9). The signal of a carbonyl group at 165.7 was assigned to C-2 based on its cross-peak with the proton signal at 5.98 (H-3) and 6.89 (H-4). The high-®eld region exhibited signals assigned to two saturated carbons [ c 24.8 (C-5) and 41.1 (C-6)] and to methoxyphenyl groups at 56.1 and 60.7. HETCOR analysis were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons, and thus the structure of amide 2 was de®ned as 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14trimethoxycinnamoyl)-Á 3 -pyridin-2-one.N-(12, 13, 14-Trimethoxydihydrocinnamoyl)-Á 3pyridin -2-one (5), Á a,b -dihydropiperine ( 8) and 5,6dihydropiperlonguminine ( 9) have the molecular formula C 17 H 21 NO 5 , C 17 H 21 NO 3 and C 16 H 21 NO 3 , respectively, by analysis of the MS data. Their 1 H NMR spectra were identical to that published for the same compounds previously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991), Piper guineense (Parmar et al., 1997) and P. tuberculatum (Bernard et al., 1995), respectively. Their 13 C NMR spectral data (Table 2) are published here for the ®rst time.N-[3-(6 H -methoxy-3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z)propenoyl]pyrrolidine (3) was previously isolated from Piper peepuloides (Shah et al., 1986) and P. hispidum (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). Piperamine (4) was previously obtained from Piper nigrum (Kiuchi et al., 1988) and P. hispidum (AleÂ cio et al., 1998). Piplartine (6) was previously described from Piper aborescens (Duh et al., 1990) and P. tuberculatum (Filho et al. 1981). Piperine (7) was previously described from P. aborescens and P. tuberculatum (ArauÂ jo-JuÂ nior et al., 1997) and pellitorine (10) had been reported from Cissampelos glaberrina (Rosario et al., 1996).The antifungal activity of amides 1±10 was evaluated by means of direct bioautography in a TLC bioassay (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds 1±10 are shown in Table 3 and were performed according to Rahalison et al. (1994). The highest sample amount tested was 10 mg; amides producing no inhibition of C. sphaerospermum growth at that level were considered inactive.The minimum quantity of compounds 1±4, 6, 8±10 necessary to inhibit growth of the fungus on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 mg, while for 7 and 5 the values were 1.0 and 0.1 mg, respectively. The values for 7 and 5 were comparable to those observed for the reference compounds miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg).P. hispidum and P. tuberculatum have accumulated amides with cis geometry in their side chain, which is a structural feature quite rare in nature (AleÂ cio et al., 1998;Shah et al., 1986).

Antifungal assayThe microorganism used in the antifungal assay C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 has been maintained at the Instituto de BotaÃ nica, SaÄ o PauloÐSP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay Ð 10 ml of solutions corresponding to 100 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with hexane:EtOAc (7:3) and dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermun in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 C. A clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicated the minimal amount of 1±10 required (Table 3). Nystatin (0.5 mg) and miconazole (0.5 mg) were used as positive controls.
Extraction and isolation of constituentsThe dried and powdered stems of P. hispidum (28.0 g) were extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3Â150 ml), for two days at room temperature. The resulting CH 2 Cl 2 extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a green gum (1.60 g). Part of this extract (1.49 g) was applied to a silica gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%) to give 24 fractions. Fraction 3 (0.203 g) was applied to a silica gel column (2.00 g) eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 1 (0.012 g). Fraction 28 (0.198 g) was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography, eluted with hexane con-taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 3 (0.004 g). Frs containing 4 were combined and concentrated in vacuo to give a green gum (0.021 g), which was further puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. The dried and powdered seeds of P. tuberculatum (24.3 g) were extracted CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH (2:1) (2 Â 600 ml) for two days at room temperature. The resulting extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a green gummy resin (2.87 g). Part of this extract (2.00 g) was fractionated by chromatographic column chromatography [eluted with Hex:-EtOAc (4:1) with gradient] to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (0.043 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 2 (0.024 g) and 6 (0.003 g). Fraction 20 (0.146 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 5 (0.005 g). Fraction 19 (0.083 g) was submitted to preparative TLC [Hex:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions] to yield 7 (0.012 g) and 8 (0.007 g). Frs. 8 and 13 yielded 10 (0.079 g) and 9 (0.018 g), respectively.  3010,2923,2874,1640,1620,1488,1443,1035, and 925 cm 1 ; ES±MS m/z (rel. int.): 324 [M+Na] (100); 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra (see Table 1).
