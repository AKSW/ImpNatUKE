A PYRANO CHALCONE AND A FLAVANONE FROM NEORAPUTIA MAGNIFICA*
The hexane extract from the stems of N. magnzjica var. magnifica, afforded two new flavonoids: 2'hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tetramethoxy-5',6'-(2",2"-dimethylpyran)chalcone and 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavanone which were identified on the basis of spectroscopic methods. The known flavonoids 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'pentamethoxychalcone, 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanone and 5,6,7.3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone, the sterols sitosterol and stigmasterol were also identified. These results do not seem to support the affiliation of Neoraputia to the tribe Cusparieae.

INTRODUCTIONNeoraputia magn$ca (Engler) Emmerich is a tree found only in northwestern Brazil [ 11. It was originally described by Engler as a species of Raputia Aublet. Emmerich later proposed the new genus Neoraputia Emmerich to accommodate six species, four of them form Raputia and two new ones. These two genera are assigned to the tribe Cusparieae [I]. No previous phytochemical work has been reported on Raputia. Recently, we have described the isolation and identification of eight polymethoxylated flavones and one flavanone from N. alba [2, 31. Little is known about the chemistry of the Neoraputia, but, to date, it differs from other taxa of the tribe Cusparieae, notably by the absence of anthranilate alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids [4]. The extensive 0-methylation of highly oxygenated flavones is a feature that is largely confined to the Citroideae [5]. Thus, our taxonomic interest in the Rutaceae stimulated an investigation of another plant of the Neoraputia genus, e.g. N. magn$ca var. magn$ca (Engler) Emmerich.
RESULTS AND DlSCCSSlONThe hexane extract from the stems of N. magnifica var. magniJica, afforded two new flavonoids 1 and 3, besides three known flavonoids 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'-* Based in part on the Ph.D. thesis presented by E.A.P.P. to the Universidade Federal de S&o Carlos.t Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.
pentamethoxychalcone(2) [6], 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanone (4) [2] and 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone (5) [7], and a mixture of sitosterol and stigmasterol.Compound 1 was isolated in very small amounts (0.7 mg) as a yellow powder. The UV absorption maximum at 286 and 352 nm suggested the presence of a chalcone [6]. The IR bands at 1620 and 3348 cm-' were attributed to chelated carbonyl and phenolic hydroxyl group, respectively. Two doublets at 6 8.05 and 7.72 (J = 16.0 Hz) in the 'H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the AB system of a chalcone and a singlet at S 14.24 corresponded to one chelated hydroxyl, thus attached to C-2'. The 'H NMR spectrum also showed features of a chromene ring (6 6.60 and 5.47 vinylic protons, and a singlet at 6 1.50, 6H, assigned to a pair of magnetically equivalent methyl group), and signals for four methoxyls. The assignment of one singlet to H-2 and H-6 (6 6.86, 2H) suggested that three methoxyls are attached to B-ring. From the biosynthetic point of view the remaining methoxyl should be attached to C-4' or C-6' of the Aring. Furthermore, a singlet at 6 6.07 (1H) clearly indicated the A-ring to be 2'.4 '5'6'-or 2',3',4',6'-tetrasubstituted. From the HMBC experiments (Table 2) the observed correlations between the hydroxyl proton at 6 14.24 and the "C signals at 6 105.9 (J'), 167.9 (J*) and 92.5 ($) led to their assignment as C-l', C-2' and C-3', respectively, and thus indicating that the unsubstituted carbon must be vicinal to C-2'. The "C NMR spectrum (Table 3) showed a signal for only one methoxyl group attached to ortho-disubstituted carbon (6 63.1) which was assigned to 4-OMe. This OMe OMe  Assignments based on HMQCHMBC for 1,2,4 and 5. all in CDClr. 1: 1" = 116.9; 2" = 124.2; 3" = 77.7; 4",'5" = 28.1. * Data obtained in this study suggest that these resonances were previously incorrectly assigned.
3: R=OMe
4: R=Himplies that the methoxyl in the A-ring is located at C-4' (6 55.9), and determined the position of the chromene ring between C-5' and O-6'. This was supported by the 'H NMR spectrum run in C6D, which showed upfield shift (As > 0.3) for three methoxyls [8]. Moreover, the existence ofcorrelation between the 'H signal at 6 6.07, assigned to H-3' (by HMQC and HMBC), and the '% signal at 6 102.9 (C-5'), confirmed the position of the chromene ring between the C-5' and O-6'. The new natural product is therefore 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5-tetramethoxy-5',6'-(2",2"dimethyl-pyran)chalcone(1). The structural assign- Compound 2 gave spectral data in agreement with those published [6] for the 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'-pentamethoxychalcone which has previously been isolated from MerriNia caloxylon (Citroideae). However, the "C NMR data for 2 are reported here for the first time (Table 3). Compound 1 and 6 were used as a model. HMQC and HMBC (Table 2) experiments with 2 permitted the assignment of the signal at 6 7.71 to H-j?, as in 1, and suggested that the highly oxygenated B-ring may have caused a upfield shift for (SPF 81-3 16) is deposited in the Herbarium of Insti-H-8. tuto de Ciencias Biologicas-USP-Sao Paula. Compound 3 was isolated with a trace of 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanone (4) previously isolated from N. a&a [3]. The mixture was analysed by GC-mass spectrometry, which established that the flavanones were 4 and 3. The presence of fragment ion at m/z 194 (100%) in the mass spectrum for 3, associated with retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of C-ring, clearly indicated the presence of three methoxyls in the B-ring. Thus, a singlet at 6 6.68 in the 'H NMR spectrum (Table 1) was assigned to H-2' and H-6', requiring the presence of methoxyls at C-3', C-4' and C-5'. The fragment ion at m/z 211, also associated with retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of C-ring, suggested that the A-ring carried three methoxyls. Therefore, three isomers are possible for this compound. The correct one was decided on the basis of '% NMR spectrum (Table 3) which showed signals for three methoxyl groups attached to ortho-disubstituted carbon (6 60.9, 61.4 and 61.7). This implies that the methoxyls in the A-ring is located at C-5, C-6 and C-7, since the 'H signal at 6 6.38 (1H)  The structure of the new natural product is therefore 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavanone (3).Isolation of compounds.

However, the assignments of 13C resonances for 5 are reported here for the first time (Table 3). Compound 3 and 5,6,7,2',3',4',5'-heptamethoxyflavone (8) [9] were used as a models. These results do not seem to support the affiliation of Neoruputiu to the Cusparieae [4]. However, many chemists are perhaps interested in alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids from Rutaceae, and will rarely identify all of the potentially systematic important classes of compounds present in the plant, e.g. flavonoids, since they are generally found in most if not all angiosperm plants. Thus, clearly rutaceous flavonoids deserve more attention than they have received so far.ment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',6'tetramethoxychalcone (6) and 2'-hydroxy-3',4',5',6'di-(2",2''-dimethylpyran)chalcone (7, flemiculosin) [9]. It has been noted that the H-/l and C-p of a chalcone are more deshielded than the H-o! and C-a [9]. However, HMQC experiments of 1 showed correlations of 'H signals at 6 8.05 and 7.72 to the 13C signals at 6 126.5 and 142.3, respectively, indicating apparent anomalies. The signal (6 6.86) assigned to H-2 and H-6 showed one-bond correlation with the 13C signals at 6 105.3. The methine proton at 6 7.72 showed cross peaks with the C-Z/C-6 signal at 6 105.3 (3J), so permitting the assignment of the signal at 6 7.72 to H-b.
for unsubstituted methine indicate that this proton must not be vicinal to C==G (C-4). A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5,7,8trimethoxyflavanone (6 89.5, C-6) 5,7,8-(6 93.7, C-6) and 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavones (6 96.7, C-S) indicated that C-8 methine resonance at lowerfield than C-6 methine [9]. Based on this evidence, the 13C signal at 6 96.4 for C-8 supported the above proposed.
