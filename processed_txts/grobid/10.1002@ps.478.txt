Biological activity of astilbin from Dimorphandra mollis against Anticarsia gemmatalis and Spodoptera frugiperda
Astilbin was isolated in high yield from Dimorphandra mollis, and its insecticidal and growth inhibiting activity by stomach ingestion were evaluated against Anticarsia gemmatalis and Spodoptera frugiperda. The insecticidal activity of astilbin, the weight reduction of the larval phase and the prolongation of the larval and pupal phases were veri®ed for both species. Astilbin was identi®ed on the base of its NMR, MS and physical data.

INTRODUCTIONThe velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis Hu È bner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a permanent inhabitant of tropical America and it is considered the major pest of soybean crops in Brazil. If not managed, infestations of caterpillar can cause serious damage to soybean and other legume crops. The caterpillar is able to strip ®elds of soybean foliage in ®ve to seven days. 1 The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a major pest of many crops in the Americas and one of the most important pests of tropical maize, causing up to 34% reduction in the overall productivity of this crop in Brazil. 2 Management of the velvetbean caterpillar can be achieved using natural enemies, insecticides and various cultural practices. A nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) of the velvetbean caterpillar has been applied as a microbial insecticide in Brazil to approximately 1 000 000 ha of soybean, 3,4 and has provided successful control for this insect.Fall armyworm in maize is usually controlled using agrochemicals, employed when the defoliation is noticed in the crops. However, due to the problems associated with the use of pesticides, specially the possibility of insecticidal resistance and reduction of predator and parasitoid insects, emphasis is being shifted to natural control. 5 In recent decades, the screening of natural insecticides has become a promising route for the discovery of new compounds that could be used in crop protection. Insecticides of plant origin may offer a source of compounds for pest control. 6±9 However, some of these compounds are very toxic to mammals. There is now a search for compounds that have other forms of biological activity such as antifeedant, repellent and insect growth regulatory action which could be used as crop-protection agents. 10 Plants phenolics, such as ¯avonoids, in¯uence the food preference and the behaviour of many different herbivores, including insects. 11,12 A crude extract of Lonchocarpus speciosus containing mixture of astilbin with other ¯avonoids showed insecticidal effects against Drosophila melonogaster Meig ¯ies. 13 Astilbin has been isolated from several sources including L speciosus, 13 Astilbe thunbergii, 14 Engelhardtia chrysolepis, 15±19 Vitis vinifera, 20 Hymenaea martiana, 21 H parvifolia, 22 Wulf®a baccata, 22 Hypericum perforatum, 23 and Smilax glabra. 24 It exhibits a variety of biological activities such as reducing total liver cholesterol concentration, 19 protecting against oxidative damage to liver mitochondria and haemo-lysis erythrocytes, 15 inhibiting lens aldose reductase to prevent cataract formation in diabetes, 16 enhancement of the vanadate-stimulated release of lipoprotein lipase activity, 17 and a hepatoprotective effect 25 in rats 26 and mice. 27 It also facilitates apoptosis of interleukin-2-dependent phytohaemaglutinin-activated jurkat cells, 28 shows antinociceptive and anti-oedematogenic, 29,30 antidepressant 23 and enzyme inhibitory properties. 17,22 The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of astilbin [(2R,3R)5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-2,3-dihydro¯avonol-3-b-O-rhamnoside], isolated for the ®rst time from Dimorphandra mollis, when administered in an arti®cial diet to A gemmatalis and S frugiperda.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Analysis
NMR analysis1 H NMR (200 MHz) and 13 C NMR (50 MHz) spectra, using tetramethylsilane as internal standard, were recorded on a Bruker ARX-200 model.
MS analysisMass spectra (Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI)/MS) were recorded on a Micromass QuattroLC.
Plant extracts 2.2.1 Plant materialThe ¯ower peduncles (161 g) and ¯owers (450 g) of Dimorphandra mollis Benth (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae) were collected in Rio Claro, Sa Äo Paulo State, Brazil, in February, 1999. These parts were dried separately in a stove with air circulation (40 °C) and milled in a Willey-type mill. A voucher was deposited at the herbarium of the Botanic Department of Universidade Estadual Paulista UNESP (number 5464).
Extraction, isolation and physical data of astilbin (Fig 1; 1)The plant material was extracted with dichloromethane (3 Â 1 litre) followed by methanol (2 Â 1 litre). The extracts were dried under reduced pressure (20 torr; 2.67 kPa) using a rotatory evaporator.The methanolic extracts of peduncles and ¯owers afforded astilbin (99.9% and 99.0% respectively, equivalent to 10.1% and 7.6% [w/w] of the dry starting material) by crystallization from aqueous methanol. The purity of astilbin was determined by recycled HPLC (polymeric packing column, Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm ID Â 50.0 cm length, eluted with methanol, ¯ow rate 7 ml min À1 , UV detector at 290 nm), as well as by its melting point.Astilbin.

Biological activityLarvae of A gemmatalis and S frugiperda were obtained from the Insect Bioassay Laboratory of Universidade Federal de Sa Äo Carlos, Brazil, and reared on arti®cial diets. 32,33 They were maintained in an incubation chamber with a photophase of 12:12 h L:D, 70 (AE5)% relative humidity and 25 (AE1) °C.For each treatment and control, 30 neonate larvae of S frugiperda or A gemmatalis were used. A solution of astilbin in water dimethyl sulfoxide (99.9 0.1 by volume; 3 ml) was added to ascorbic acid (1.8 g; an ingredient of the diet) and, after evaporation of the solvent under vacuum at 40 °C in a rotary evaporator, the mixture was incorporated to the arti®cial diet 32,33 at ®nal concentrations of 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg kg À1 . Diet for the control was prepared similarly but without the astilbin. The diets were placed in previously sterilized glass tubes (8.5 cm Â 2.5 cm), into which larvae of S frugiperda and A gemmatalis were introduced individually. Daily observations were made and the following parameters were evaluated: (1) duration of larval and pupal phases; (2) duration of the life cycle (larva to emergence of adult); (3) weight of pupae and (4) percentage of living insects (viability) at the end of each phase.
StatisticsData were submitted to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) 34 and the averages were compared applying the Tukey test (P 0.05). Each tube containing one insect, independent of the development phase, was considered as one replicate, therefore the number of replicates was different for each treatment. For evaluation of the viability of the larval phase, pupal phase and total cycle, the experimental unit was constituted by the mean of ®ve tubes with one larva each, with six replications by treatment.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe experiment with S frugiperda larval and pupal phases did not show any statistical differences between the treatments and the control (Table 1). However, when the astilbin concentration in the diet was increased, non-signi®cant extensions of 1.2 days in the larval phase and 0.7 days in the pupal phase were observed when compared to the control. For A gemmatalis, a slower larval (0.5 days) and pupal (1.3 days) development was observed, but this difference was not statistically signi®cant (Table 2). A small prolongation of the larval and pupal phases of the insect produced statistically signi®cant increases in the total cycle duration time (from larva to the emergence of the adult) of 1.53 days for S frugiperda and 2.27 days for A gemmatalis, in comparison with their respective controls. This alteration in the insect development and the prolongation of the cycle suggest that astilbin has a toxic effect on the insect which could be responsible for the characteristic antibiosis effect of D mollis to insects. Astilbin effectively debilitates the insect larvae, retards their growth or delays their pupation. As a consequence, the insect could be more vulnerable to the action of entomopathogens, entomophagous agents and environmental variations. 35 A small but signi®cant reduction (264±240 mg) in the pupal weight of S frugiperda treated with astilbin was observed compared with the control (Fig 2). However, no statistical difference was found for the pupal weight of A gemmatalis (Fig 2 ), a similar result obtained to those by Gazzoni et al 36 for quercetin.Signi®cant differences were observed for viability (total survival rates) of larvae, pupae and total life cycle for S frugiperda and A gemmatalis by increasing the concentration of astilbin in the diet (Figs 3 and4). The viability varied from 100.0% (control) to 93.3% (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg kg À1 ) for the S frugiperda larval phase (Fig 3) and for A gemmatalis a greater reduction was found, from 90.0% (control) to 76.7% (1.0 and 10.0 mg kg À1 ) (Fig 4). In the pupal phase, the viability decreased signi®cantly, changing from 80.0% (con-    trol) to 33.3% (10.0 mg kg À1 ) for S frugiperda and from 96.7% (control) to 53.36% (10.0 mg kg À1 ) for A gemmatalis. These variations interfered signi®cantly with the total cycle viability, the observed average viability varying from 80.0% (control) to 26.2% (10.0 mg kg À1 ) for S frugiperda and from 86.7% (control) to 33.3% (10.0 mg kg À1 ) for the A gemmatalis. These results indicate that the insects are more sensitive to astilbin during the pupal phase. In the pupal phase, the morphological and physiological changes demand an intense biochemical activity, which could be harmed by the action of astilbin in the larval phase, resulting in weight reduction of the pupa. 37,38 The mode of action of astilbin was not investigated in this work. However, Appel 39 reported that the toxic effect of phenolic compounds can be related to oxygen radical species formation during oxidation. These radicals disrupt membrane integrity and the metabolism in the gut epithelium. Digestion inhibition can also result from the formation of covalent bonds with dietary proteins or digestive enzymes. Therefore, phenolic compounds may have direct negative effects on herbivores as feeding deterrents, digestion inhibitors and generators of oxygen radicals. Feeding deterrence is positively correlated with chemical astringency, the ability of phenolics to precipitate protein. The alkaline conditions in the insect gut could promote enzymes to hydrolyze of the ¯avonoid yielding the free aglycon, which could intervene in the larval and/or pupal phases. 40,41 Adults emerging from low-weight pupae could be more debilitated and would have lower capacity of competition for vital activities than individuals from healthy pupae. The results of this work indicate astilbin to be a potential insecticide for S frugiperda and A gemmatalis larvae. Astilbin occurs in high concentration in D mollis, and further studies have to be done to develop methodology for its use as a natural insect control agent. There is no reference to the interaction between this plant and other insects in the literature, and this is the ®rst time that astilbin has been isolated from D mollis.Figure 1 .1Figure 1. Astilbin.
