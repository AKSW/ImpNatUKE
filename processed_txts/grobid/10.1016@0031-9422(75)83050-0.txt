The CHCI, extract gave a main mixed band (R, 0.62) by preparative TLC (Si gel G with CHCI,-EtOH, 9:l) not separable by crystallization or argentized TLC. NMR and MS indicated that the band was a mixture. Separation of the mixed acety-Iated methyl esters by GLC (2'%, XE60, on WHP (Aw-DMCS) with 30 ml/min N, at 250 ) gave three peaks with R;s equivalent to the derivatives of oleanolic. ursolic and micromeric acids.

The genera Nectandra and Ocotea (Lauraceae) are well represented in the Brazilian flora. They are generally characterized by the occurrence of alkaloids of the benzylisoquinoline-aporphine group [l, 23. We now report the occurrence in a Nectandra species of indoles which have previously been associated with hallucinogenic preparations from, for example, Piptadenia (Leguminosae) [3,4] Banistrriopsis (Malpighiaceae) [S, 61 and I/irola (Myristicaceae) [7] species. The bark of Nectandra megapotamica (Sprg.) Chodat et Hassler, a tree of medium height growing in the north-east of S. Paulo state, is popularly attributed with the property of relieving pain [S]. A chemical and pharmacological investigation was therefore undertaken. Two strong bases were isolated and shown to be indoles by UV spectrometry. One was identified as N-methyltryptamine(1). The other was identified by IR, UV and NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry as 6-methoxy-N-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-j?-carboline(2). Comparison with authentic samples [9] confirmed the identity.

EXPERIMENTAL Isolation of the ulkaloids. Finely powdered bark (5.7 kg) of Nectmdra megapotav~icn was percolated with cold EtOH giving. after evaporation. a resinous extract ( I200 g). This extract (950 g) was treated with dil. aq. tartartc acid at pH 4 at 5' for 15 hr and filtered. The filtrate (2.5 1.1 was extracted successively with hexane, C,H,, and CH,CI, at pH 4. Three more CHzCl, extractions were then made at pH 7 (by addition of NaHCO,). pH 9, pH 12 (by addition of Na,CO,) and pH 14 (by addition of NaOH). During the bastfication a semi-solid mass prccipitated. and was separated at pH 14 by decantation. Little basic residue was obtained from the various organic extracts, but repeated Soxhlet extraction of the semi-solid mass with CH,CI, gave a brown residue (50 g) which exhibited 2 pr-incipal spots on TLC.
