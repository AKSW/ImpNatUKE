TWO ANTHRAQUINONES FROM VlZNTILAGO CAL XULATA
The trunk wood of the central Brazilian Ocotea aciphylla contains two hydrobenzofuranoid and three bicyclo[3.2.l]octanoid neolignans. The former comprise a novel representative of the rare ferrearin (3a-allyl-2-aryl-7ahydroxy-3-methyl-2,3,3~4,7,7a-hexahydro-7-oxo~~ofuran) type.

INTRODUCTIONOcotea aaphylla, a lauraceous tree popularly known as canelaamarela, ranges in central Brazil from Minas Gerais and Espirito Santa to Santa Catarina. Its heartwood resists termites and is used for flooring [2]. Trunk wood, collected m the vicinity of Brasilia, D.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe HR mass spectra of 3a and 3b were superimposable This indicates the association of H-2 with the oxygen atom of HO-7a only m 3a which thus must sustain both substituents m the syn-configuration; in contradistinction to 3b where H-2 and HO-7a occupy opposite sides of the molecule. As 1s consequently to be expected, the ' 3C NMR spectrum reveals hydroxyl-7a to contribute y-effects on C-2 (681.7) and C-3 (644.3) of 3a, but not on C-2 (688.7) of 3b. However, the configurations of C-3 in both compounds are identical and it is less easy to rationalize the fact that as C-2, C-3 (6 50.3) of 3b also does not feel the yeffect due to hydroxyl-7a. The H-2, H-3 coupling constants for both compounds are rather large (ca 10 Hz) and the H-2-H-3 dihedral angle thus must be close to 0" in 3a and close to 180" in 3b. Models of the compounds, constructed considering also this conformational information, indicate the possible existence of a hydrogen bridge between the oxygen at C-7a and the aryl at C-2. This preferential orientation of the hydroxyl towards the aryl in 3b impedes the transmission of the y-effect from its oxygen to C-3.The allylic methylene carbons of 3a and 3b are shielded (640. 1, 39.6, respectively) in comparison with the analogous group of the model compound 4 (643.9) [7] and thus occur most probably in a syn-relationship with the methyls at C-3. Indeed these substituents appear to be shielded reciprocally if 3a and 3b (6 10.6,9.4, respectively) are again compared with the model compound 4 (6 12.0) mThe relative stereochemistries which thus result for ferrearin-B (3a) and C (3b) differ from those originally proposed for ferrearin-A (Sa) and B (5b) [6]. The structures of the two latter compounds thus must be revised respectively to 3c and 3a. The model compound (6) on which the previous assignments were based lacks rdenttfied by Prof Jose Ehas de Paula, Universtdade de Bra&a, was dried, powdered (3.9 kg) and extracted wtth petrol. The solvent was evapd and the residue (44 g) crystallized from MeOH to pure 1 (2.4 g) and other less pure fracttoni. The mother liquor was evapd and the residue (30g) was submttted to dry CC (300g sthca gel + 10% HaO, C,H,-EtOAc 4: 1). The column was dtvtded into 10 equal porttons which were eluted separately wrth Me&O The eluates of portions 2+3 (68 g) were crystallized from MeOH to 3b (180 mg). The eluate of portton 4 (3.4 g) was purified by CC and repeated TLC (silica gel) to 2b (10 mg). The eluates of porttons 5 + 6 + 7 (12 6 g) were separated by an analogous procedure mto 3a (30 mg) and 2a (10 mg).

INTRODUCTIONThe genus Venttlugo 1s a rich source of anthraqumones [l-4]. Further investigation of the root bark of Ventilngo calyculata afforded two more new anthraquinones, 2 and 4, in addition to the eleven anthraquinones reported previously [2].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPigment 2, C16H1206, gives a positive reduction test with Na2S204, indicating its anthraquinone nature, and forms a trimethyl ether. It is soluble in aqueous sodium carbonate suggesting the presence of a fl-hydroxyl group, and as there is only one IR carbonyl band, at 1630 cm-', the remaining two hydroxyl groups are in a-positions, and from the visible spectrum (A_ 443 nm) it must be a 1,5 or 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone.The 'H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of a fi-hydroxyl and two peri-hydroxyl groups, and shows signals for a methoxyl and a b-methyl group. In addition an ABC pattern for three aromatic protons at 67.26 (d, J = 8 Hz), 7.63 (t, J = 8 Hz) and 7.79 (d, .I = 8 Hz) indicated that one ring carries only a peri-substituent. Hydrolysis of the methoxyl group with 80 % H2S04 indicates that it is located at a peri position, and as the product was 2-hydroxylslandicin 1 the new pigment must be either 2 or 3. The latter was excluded on the basis of a negative zirconium nitrate test, and the absence of a shift in the visible spectrum on addltlon of NaOAc-H,BOJ (for alizarin the shift 1s 22 nm) thus demonstrating the absence of a vicinal dihydroxy system. Hence the pigment has structure 2. The trimethyl ether of 2 was identical with the tetramethyl ether of 2-hydroxyislandicin (1).The second new pigment 4, C,7H1407r shows all the features of 2 except that the 'HNMR spectrum reveals the presence of a second methoxyl group and the ABC system 1s replaced by two meta protons. Demethylation ofF., yielded five *Part LXXVI in the series "The Chemistry of BraPhan Lauraceae". For Part LXXV see ref. [l].

neolignans. The three bicyclo[3.2.l]octanoids 1 (canellin-A), 2a and 2b (S-methoxyguianin) have been isolated from &aria canella 133, Ocotea catharinensrs [4] and kziba afinrs [S], respectively, and were identified by direct comparison with authentic samples. The neolignan 3a was identified with ferrearin-B previously isolated from Aniba ferrea [6]. Compound 3b proved to be novel and was designated ferrearin-C.
Ar = a -plperonyl 3~ Ar = fl-3 --methoxy -4,5 -methylenedloxy h should thus be stereoisomers. The close correspondence of the 'H and '%NMR signals assigned to the cyclohexenone part of the structures indicates that the difference resides in the configuration of C-2 or C-3. Indeed, the compounds differ only in the 2,3-CIS (3a) and 2,3-rrans (3b) arrangement of the aryl/methyl substituents, as shown by the 'HNMR Me-doublets (J = 8 Hz) at 60.77 versus 0.96, respectively. The sole other conspicuous difference in these spectra refers to the H-2 doublets (J = 10 Hz) at 65.40 versus 4.67, respectively.
