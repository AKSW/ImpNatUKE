TERPENES OF PODOCARPUS LAMBERTIUS
INTRODUCTIONPodocarpus lamhertius, commonly known as pinheiro bravo [I], is one of two Brazilian species of the genus Podocarpus and a tree widely distributed throughout southern Brazil. In continuation of our chemical studies of podocarps [2] an investigation of the terpenic constituents of P. lambertius bark and leaves was undertaken.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThree bark constituents were identified as sitosterol, 4/?-carboxynortotarol(1) [3-S] and macrophyllic acid (2) [7,9, lo], while the remaining substances CZoH,,O, and CZ0HZ803 required full structural analysis.(1)(2)The IR spectrum of the compound C20H3002 revealed an aromatic ring and hydroxy groups and the facile transformation into a diacetate con-firmed the presence of two hydroxy functions. The PMR spectrum of the diol in CDCl, showed two aromatic one-proton doublets at 6.50 and 6.96 ppm with J-values of 9 Hz each, which moved to 7.05 and 7.15 ppm in deuteriopyridine, indicating two vicinal aromatic hydrogens one of which was ortho to a phenolic hydroxy group [l 11. The presence of an isopropyl group on the benzene ring Cl.3 1 ppm (d, 3, J 7 Hz, Me), 1.33 (d, 3, J 7 Hz, Me), 3.28 (m, 1, CH)] and its vicinality to the hydroxy function was indicated by the deuteriopyridine shift ( 1.67-Me, 1.71-Me, 3.5hCH). These observations indicated a totarol skeleton or its biogenetically less likely 11 -isopropyl-12-hydroxy isomer. The PMR spectrum exhibited also a oneproton doublet of doublets at 3.28 ppm (J 10, 7 Hz), indicative of a set-hydroxy group adjacent to a quaternary carbon center. The high-field position of the oxymethine indicated its equatorial nature [ 12,131. The strong deuteriopyridine shift exerted not only on the oxymethine (3.284 3.50 ppm) but also on two methyl singlets (0.87-+ 1.14, 1.05+ 1.32 ppm) and only a minor shift (A6 011 ppm) on the remaining methyl singlet suggested a 3b-hydroxytotarol(3) relationship. The diol 3 had been reported as a product of borohydride reduction [ 141 of the naturally occurring 3-totarolone [ 151 and its MS was recorded [ 141. Comparison of the highly characteristic fragmentation pat-tern and the other physical properties of an authentic specimen [16] with those of the C2,)H3~,02 product showed the compound to be 3/Ghqdroxq.totarol (3).   The CZoH,,O substance showed IR absorption bands characteristic of hydroxy and olefinic units, which were confirmed by the PMR spectrum. The latter revealed an oxymethylene singlet at 4.17 Base-induced deuteration of the substance showed the presence of two hydrogens r to the car-bony1 group. If it be assumed that the compound is an all-rr.rrns 3-hydroxysteroid, the facts accumulated thus far supported a 3.5dihydroxy-6-keto or 3.8-dihydroxy-7-keto structure.The 16-keto system was excluded by the carbonyl group not being part of a five-membered ring. while the 4-keto system could be dismissed by the persistence of the 3oxymethine PMR signal even after deuteration and by the abnormally high field position and far too complex multiplicity for an r-ketooxymethine moiety. The two remaining structures could be differentiated by PMR in pyridine [ 111. Comparison of the PMR spectra of the natural product in CDCl, and pyridine revealed no solvent effect on the methyl groups but an extraordinary shift on the methine associated with the src-hydroxy function. The oxymethine multiplet, whose shape (e.g. W 1 2 = 16 Hz) was highly reminiscent of 3/&hydroxysteroids, shifted 0.73 ppm downfield in pyridine solution. This was in sharp contrast to the A6 values of 0.25. 0.24. 0.26 and 0.16 ppm for 3fl-hydroxy-5%. 3/j-hydroxy-.5P.3x-hydroxy-5x and 3~ hydroxy-5B steroids, respectively, and reflected the proximity of the rc>rt-hydroxy group to the 3cc-hydrogen and the effect of both hydroxy functions complexed by pyridine acting on this hydrogen. This structural relationship is satisfied only by a 3[).5x-dihydroxy-6-keto system. In order to confirm the functional groups of the Cz9H,,,0, product and their positions in the steroid framework, the spectral properties of the compound and of its monoacetate were compared with those of 3/1.5x-dihydroxy-6-cholestanone (13a) [22] and of its acetyl derivative.*The 6 and J values of H(3) and H(7) and of the 1%. 19, 21-. 26 and 27-methyl groups of the natural product and its acetate were nearly identical with those of the corresponding models. This observation suggested that the new plant product is 3P.S~-dih!drox~-(stigmastanonc (1X). As a consequence. a partial systhesis from /I'-sitosterol was undertaken.Trcatment of the latter with formic acid and \vith hjdrogen peroxide. followed 1~) hydrolysis Lvith X~LICOLIS base gave a trio1 whose oxidation with N-bromosuccinimide[22] yielded 13b. The identity of this substance with the natural product full! cstablished its structure.

Its PMR spectrum in CDCI, solution rcvealud t\\o arotnatic hydrogen singlets at 6.59 and 6.79 pptn which shifted to 7.21 and 7.0X ppm in dcuteriop>ri-.dine [I I]. indicaticc of a I.-1.S-tt-ialk~latod phenol moiety. The prcsencc of an isopropyl group was shown by two methyl doublets at I.20 (.I 7 HI) and I.22 ppm (J 7 H7) and a methinc scptei at 3% pprn (J 7 H7) and its orflzo relationship with the phcnolit hydroxl group indicated by tho douteriop)ridine shift I 1.35.

These facts suggested that latnbcrtic acid possessed an singlets (IO.3 and 1.2X ppm) appeared in the PMR spectrum and were displaced to a single punk at 1.38 pptn in deuteriopyridinc.

The idcntitl of the MS fragmentation pattern of the non-aromatic portion of lambertic acid with that of 4/1-carboa> nortotarol (1) showed the new compound to bc I%isopropylpodocarpic acid ( = 4P-carbox\,norferr~tgi~l~~l) (4) Cl0 An exhaustive study of the MS fragtncntntion of tricyclic, aromatic diterpcncs of ring A and B low oxidation level has shown that two primary fragmentation patterns involve the productiotl of M ' -43 and M ~ -15 ions (5 and 6, respccti\zl! ) and that the latter undcrgocs further cxtensivc fragmcntation [ lc).N].

ppm, which was shifted to 4.43 ppm in deuteriopyridine [ 1 11, and an olefinic hydrogen singlet at 5.63 ppm with a dcuteriopyridine shift of 5.83 ppm [l 11. These facts are accommodated most readily by a 2.3-dialkylallyl alcohol moiety. Three methyl groups appeared at @74. 0.81 and 0the methyl groups (0.74 ppm) was reminiscent of the effect of the nuclear double bond of hibaene and isophyllocladene (9b) upon their angular methyl groups. Comparison of the chemical shifts of the C(4) and C(10) methyl groups of the alcohol with the methyl shifts of isophyllocladene showed them to be identical. Hence the new alcohol was 17-isophyllocladenol (12). The C19H,,0, product revealed TR absorption bands for hydroxyl and acyclic or six-membered * The relationship of the individual functional groups to their environment was shown also by the products of some simple reactions of the natural substance. While treatment of the latter with Ac,O and C,H,N gave a monoacetate. acetylation under BF, catalysis yielded a diacetate (m.p. 169-170 ), Comparison of the PMR spectra of the two acetates showed that the introduction of the second acctyl group had no effect on any methyl groups but deshielded the 3-oxymethine by 0.23 ppm in conformity with the presence of a 5%-hydroxy group oriented I,3-diaxially toward the 3r-hydrogen. Oiidation of the natural product with chromic acid in C,H,N gave a hqdroxydione (m.p. 25 I 253 ) whose lkile, acid-induced dehydration with formation of a conjugated cnedione cyclic, saturated keto groups. Its PMR spectrum revealed six methyl signals whose chemical shifts and multiplicities were indicative of a stigmastane skeleton. One of the oxygens reflected a src-hydroxy group in view of a 3.95 ppm oxymethine PMR multiplet which was shifted to 5.03 ppm on acetylation of the product. The remaining presence of a hydroxy absorption band in the IR spectrum of the monoacetate showed the three oxygens of the natural compound to be part of a keto group, of one sot-hydroxy function and of a tc>rt-hydroxy unit. The ORD spectrum of the C79H5003 compound exhibited a negative Cotton effect at 323 nm characteristic of 4-, 6-, 7-and 16-ketocholestanes [21].
