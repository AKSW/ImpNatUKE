GRAYANOSIDE A, A NEW DITERPENE GLUCOSIDE FROM LEUCOTHOE GRAYANA
Two novel diterpenes, veadeirol (1) and veadeiroic acid 6 7.22 (IH, d, J = 8 Hz) and 7.88 (lH, d, J = 8 Hz). The (2), have been isolated from the hexane extract of the downfield shifts observed for these two protons upon stem of VelEozia ~u~icu~s Mart& ex. Schultz. To date conversion of 1 to 2, and also for the methylene protons only one other natural product with the same abnormal of the ethyl group, now at 6 3.10, defined the substitution cleistanthane skeleton has been reported [l-3].pattern of the aromatic ring. Examination of the IR spectrum of 1, &H,,O, established the presence of a hydroxyl group (3220 cm-') and a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring (1480-1420 and 820 cm-') [4]. The PMR spectrum showed two aromatic protons, 6 7.18 {2H, s), and a singlet at 6 4.68 (2H), assigned to a benzylic alcohol grouping (AK&OH). Signals for three tertiary methyl groups at 6 0.94 (3H, s), 0.98 (3H, s), and 1.20 (3H, s) together with an ethyl group at 6 1.18 (3H, t, J = 7 Hz, ArCH,C&) and 2.70 (2H, q, J = 7 Hz, ArCll,CH3) were readily identified.The structures proposed for 1,2, and the corresponding methyl ester 3, were confirmed by the comparison of their t3C NMR spectra (Table 1) with the data recorded for several other diterpenes [5,6].Oxidation of 1 with CrO,-pyridine furnished an unstable aldehyde which, in the presence of air, was readily converted to an acid, C,,H,,O,, identical with the acid 2 isolated from the plant. Analysis of the PMR spectrum of 2 demonstrated that the two aromatic protons previously noted for 1 were ortho to each other, p.   A number of diterpenoids with A-nor-B-homo( -)kaurane skeleton have been isolated from Leucothoe grayuna El], but their glycoside has not been reported. Now we report the isolation andstructural determination of an A-nor-B-homo-( -)-kaurane glucoside from the methanolic extract of the plant, for which we suggest the name grayanoside A.The PMR spectrum of grayanoside A (1) indicated the presence of three tertiary methyls (6 1.20, 1.48, 1.63), a secondary acetoxyl (6 2.02, S.S2), a vinyf~dene group (6 S.O4,5.08) and theexpected signals for a D-glucopyranosyl moiety (S 3.84.6). Acetylation of 1 with Ac,U-Py gave a pentaacetate (2). Acid hydroiysis of 1 yielded only a glucose and attempts to isolate the aglycone part were not successful. However, enzymatic hydrolysis of 1 with naringinase gave the genuine a&cone (3). The PMR spectrum suggested that 3 was one of the grayanotoxins, and in fact, 3 was identified as grayanotoxin IV [23 by TLC, IR, and mmp.From tbe PMR coupling constants (S 4.85, d, J = 8 Hz) of the anomeric protons of 1 and 2, 1 must be a /IIglucoside. Tke position of giucosidation in the aglycone 3 was determined by "C-NMR. The i3C-NMR signals were assigned by means of single-frequency off-resonance decouplings, by selective proton decouplings, and by comparing the spectra of several model compounds.As ee3 -0.15; Aea3z -1.8; &,ee + 2.6.
