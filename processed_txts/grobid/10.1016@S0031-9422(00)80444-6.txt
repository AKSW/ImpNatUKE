DITERPENES WITH PIMARANE AND CLEISTANTHANE SKELETONS FROM VELLOZIA PIRESIANA
and three new diterpenes, one of the pimarane type and the other two with a cleistanthane skeleton. Their structures were deduced on the basis of spectral data and chemical modifications.

INTRODUCTIONAs part of our systematic phytochemical investigation of Brazilian Velloziaceae, we wish to report on the study of Vellozia piresiana L. B. Smith, a perennial species widely distributed in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The hexane extract of a sample of this plant collected on the Serra do Cipb, State of Minas Gerais, has been shown to have ichthyotoxic activity in Lebistes reticulatus*.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe hexane extract of roots, stem and leaf'sheaths of V. piresiana afforded five known compounds: fl-sitosterol and stigmasterol isolated as a mixture and identified by comparison with authentic samples, taraxerone (1) [l], compactone (2) [2], and 78-8/l-dihydroxy-3-oxopimar-15-ene (4) [3]. In addition three new diterpenes (3,5 and 6) were isolated and are reported in this paper. The dlterpenes can be divided into two groups on the basis of their skeletons.
Group I (pimarane type)The spectral data of diterpene 3 suggested the presence of one hydroxyl, one carbonyl, one vinyl and four tertiary methyl groups. This information, together with the molecular formula, CZOH3202 (HRMS), suggested that 3 was a diterpenoid of the pimarane type, with a structure similar to 2, a compound found in the same extract.The absence of carbinolic protons in the 'HNMR spectrum of 3 indicated that the hydroxyl group was tertiary. On the other hand, the ' %J NMR spectrum of 3 showed typical absorptions for a carbonyl group at C-3 i.e. singlets at 647.4 (C-4) and 217.2 (C-3) (Table 1). The  The other diterpene (4) of the pimarane type was obtained as colourless crystals, and had the formula CzDHJzOJ. The IR spectrum showed a broad absorption at 3370 (OH), a carbonyl absorption at 1690 cm-' and a vinyl band at 900 cm-l. The 'H NMR spectra m deuterochloroform and -pyridine were similar to that of 3 except other hand, m spite of exhaustive attempts, it was not possible by preparative TLC or column chromatography to isolate 6 as a pure compound, minor amounts of 5 remaining as an impurity.The high-resolution mass spectrum of 5 indicated the molecular formula &,Hz602. The IR spectrum showed absorptions for 'normal' (1700 cm-') and conjugated (1665 cm-') carbonyl groups and a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring (830cm-'). This was confirmed by the UV spectrum which exhibited absorptions at 218 (log& = 4.09), 255 (log E = 3.85) and 304 nm (log E = 3.08). The 'HNMR spectrum showed four C-methyl resonances (6 1.12,1.25, 1.41 and 2.37, this latter signal assigned to an aromatic methyl substituent), and two doublets for two aromatic protons ortho to each other at S 7.07 (J = 8 Hz) and 6 7.3 (J = 8 Hz). The signals at 6 1.25 (3H, t, J = 7 Hz) and the complex pattern between 62.8 at 3.1 (2H, m) corresponded to an ethyl group attached to the aromatic nucleus. Double lrradiatlon experiments demonstrated that these five protons were mutually spin coupled.These data, m combination with comparative analysis of the proton noise decoupled and single frequence off resonance decoupled ' 3C NMR spectra, allowed expansion of the partial structure to (CO), (C), (CH) (CH,), H" (Me),.These results, together with biogenetic considerations and the previous isolation of cleistanthane diterpenoids from plants of this family [7, 81, supported structure 5. The chemical shift of the angular methyl carbon (6 21.3) also proved the A/B ring Junction to be trans with a carbonyl group at C-3. The absolute configuration of 5 was deduced by chemical correlation with cleistantha-8, 11,13-trien-7-one (7), isolated from Vellozia leptopetala [9] and of known absolute stereochemistry.Catalytic hydrogenation of 5 m the presence of 10% Pd-C at 62 psi in acetic acid gave compound 8. However, when the reaction was run at 45 psi under otherwise identical experimental conditions, a mixture of 8 and 9 was obtained. The magnitude of the couphng constants for the carbmohc proton m the 'H NMR spectrum of 9 indicates that the hydroxyl group has the equatorial (B) orientation. Reduction of ketone 8 with sodium borohydride m methanol afforded the alcohol 10 (IR: 3485 cm-'). This, upon dehydration with POCl, in pyridine at room temperature furnished 11 ('H NMR: 6 5.54, 2H, m). Catalytic reduction of olefin 11 m the presence of 10% PdX at 60 psi in ethyl acetate gave hydrocarbon 12, previously obtained by hydrogenolysls of ketone 7 [9]. and by spraymg a 0.2 % soln of Ce(SO,), m 2 N HISOb followed by heating on a hot plate.

The configuration of C-13 was confirmed by the chemical shift of Me-17 (6 24.4), since it is known that axial methyl groups are usually more shielded than equatorial ones [S].
