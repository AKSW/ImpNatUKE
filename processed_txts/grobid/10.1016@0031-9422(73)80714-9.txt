A NEW XANTHONE FROM LOROSTEMON SPECIES*
Plant. Ocotea pubercula (Nees et Mart) Nees from Provincia de Misiones (Argentina).

The trunk wood of two Amazonian Guttiferae species, Lorostemon coelhoi Paula and L. negrensis Froes,2 yielded yellow crystals of a new compound, lorostemin. Preliminary scrutiny of MS and PMR spectra of the compound disclosed the formula C,3H,02(OH)z-OMe(CH=CHCMe,O)which is compatible with a xanthone structure. Two of the undefined protons must be para related and both ortho to hydroxyls. Their PMR singlets appear at a substantially lower field in the spectrum of the diacetate than in the spectrum of the dimethyl ether (An-a 040 ppm, An-5 O-48 ppm). The third singlet of the aromatic PMR region, which is not shifted upon acetylation, occurs at relatively high field (T 3.43), and corresponds thus to a proton at C-2 or C-4 of a 1,3-dioxygenated ring.3 Only the former alternative can be correct, since treatment of di-0-methyllorostemin with cold cont. H,SO, leads to a 1-hydroxyxanthone (AlCl,-shift of UV maxima) which gives a negative Gibbs test.4 The angular pyrano-structure I which thus emerges for lorostemin is consistent with the wavelength of the principal UV maximum (275 nm). Linear pyranoxanthones show the corresponding band at 295 nm.5 0 OMe0Even diffuse daylight transforms lorostemin gradually into a sparingly soluble derivative. Both compounds are soluble in aqueous borax and show similar mass spectral fragmentation patterns. The PMR spectra of the acetates are identical with respect to the aromatic regions. The signals due to the side chain protons, however, are strikingly different, revealing the replacement of the olefinic protons of lorostemin by protons at saturated carbons in the derivative. Light induced double bond addition must thus be held responsible for its formation. * Part XXXII in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Guttiferae".
