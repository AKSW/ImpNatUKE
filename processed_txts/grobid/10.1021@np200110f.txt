Azaphilones from the Endophyte Chaetomium globosum
Six new azaphilones, 5 0 -epichaetoviridin A ( 7), 4 0 -epichaetoviridin F (9), 12β-hydroxychaetoviridin C (10), and chaetoviridins GÀI (11À13), and six known azaphilones, chaetoviridins AÀE (1À5) and 4 0 -epichaetoviridin A (8), were isolated from the endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum cultivated in PDB medium for 21 days. The structure elucidation and the assignment of the relative configurations of the new natural products were based on detailed NMR and MS spectroscopic analyses. The structure of compound 1 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The absolute configurations of compounds 4, 7, 8, and 12 were determined using Mosher's method. The antibiotic activity of the compounds was evaluated using an in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans infection model.

b S Supporting Information E ndophytic fungi are microorganisms that live in the inter-and intracellular spaces of the tissues of apparently healthy host plants and do so in a variety of relationships, ranging from symbiotic to pathogenic. 1 Endophytes can inhabit the tissue of living plants for all or part of their life cycle and are considered relatively underexploited sources of novel bioactive compounds. 2,3 As part of our bioprospecting studies on endophytes, we isolated several endophytic fungi that produce bioactive compounds. 4,5 The endophytic strain Chaetomium globosum, isolated from the leaves of Viguiera robusta (Asteraceae), was found to produce cytotoxic chaetoglobosins in Czapek medium. 6 Other recent studies on biologically active metabolites from the endophytic C. globosum from Ginkgo biloba led to the isolation of bioactive azaphilones. 7 The azaphilones represent a structurally diverse family of natural products containing a pyrano-quinone structure. These compounds have been isolated from various fungi. Chaetoviridins were first characterized from the soil strain C. globosum var. flavo-viriade. 8 Seven chaetoviridins have been reported to date: chaetoviridins AÀF (1À6) and 4 0 -epichaetoviridin A (8). 8,9 Chaetoviridin A (1) inhibits tumor promotion by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in a two-stage carcinogenesis model in mice. 10 Tomoda et al. 11 found that chaetoviridins A (1) and B (2) inhibited cholesteryl ester transfer protein. Chaetoviridin A (1) showed antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of Pyricularia oryzae mycelia at 2.5 μg mL À1 . 8 Recently, Park et al. 12 reported that chaetoviridins A (1) and B (2) also display inhibitory activity against the in vitro growth of Magnaporthe grisea (rice blast) and Pythium ultimum mycelia with MIC values of 1.23 and 33.3 μg mL À1 , respectively. In addition, chaetoviridins A (1) and B (2)   exhibited strong in vivo antifungal activity against M. grisea and Puccnicia recondite (wheat leaf rust).In this paper, we describe the isolation and structural elucidation of six new azaphilones (7, 9À13) along with six previously known azaphilones (1À5, 8). 8,9 Structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic data, mainly 1D and 2D NMR. The structure previously reported for epi-chaetoviridin A has been revised and corrected to 8. In addition, the in vivo anti-infective activities of the isolated azaphilones (1À5, 7À13) were evaluated using the well-studied nematode Caenorhabditis elegans infected with the human opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.
' RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCultured C. globosum produced the known chaetoviridins 1À5 and 8 8,9 and six new chaetoviridins: 5 0 -epichaetoviridin A (7), 4 0 -epichaetoviridin F (9), 12β-hydroxychaetoviridin C (10), and chaetoviridins GÀI (11À13).The known chaetoviridins AÀE (1À5) were identified by comparing their physical and spectroscopic data with literature values. 8,9 The structure of chaetoviridin A (1) was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 1).The spectroscopic data of compound 8 (Supporting Information) were coincident with those published in the literature for epi-chaetoviridin A, reported as the C 5 0 epimer of 1. 9 The epimerization at C 5 0 was proposed on the basis of no correlation between H-4 0 and H-5 0 in the NOESY spectrum, which had been observed in 1. 9 We applied the Mosher method to unambiguously establish the orientation of the hydroxyl group at C 5 0. The (R)-and (S)-MPA esters 8a and 8b were obtained by treatment of 8 with (R)-and (S)-MPA acids, respectively. Negative Δδ RS (δ R À δ S ) values were found for H-4 0 and H-4 0 CH 3 (À0.102 and À0.314, respectively), while a positive Δδ RS value was found for H-6 0 (þ0.125). Following the MPA rules, these data indicated the R-configuration for C 5 0 in 8, which is identical to those described for 1. In addition, C 4 0 , C 5 0 , and C 6 0 chemical shifts of 8 are shielded compared to the same carbons in 1, while in compound 7 C 5 0 is deshielded compared to 1. These data suggested that compound 8 must be the 4 0 -epimer, and not the 5 0 -epimer, of chaetoviridin A (1), as proposed by Phonkerd et al. 9 Therefore, the NMR data previously attributed to epi-chaetoviridin A 9 are in fact in agreement with the structure of 4 0 -epichaetoviridin A (8).The HRMS and 13 C NMR spectra of compound 7 established its molecular composition as C 23 H 25 ClO 6 , a chaetoviridin A (1) isomer. Its 1 H NMR spectrum showed signals very similar to those of 1 (Supporting Information). However, the upfield shift of the signal corresponding to H-4 0 CH 3 and the deshielded chemical shift of the signal corresponding to H-6 0 suggested that this compound was 5 0 -epichaetoviridin A (7). This hypothesis was confirmed by the application of Mosher's method. In accordance with this method, the corresponding Mosher diastereoisomeric esters 7a and 7b were obtained by treatment of 7 with (R)-and (S)-MPA acids, respectively. Positive Δδ RS (δ R À δ S ) values were found for H-4 0 and H-4 0 CH 3 (þ0.101 and þ0.105, respectively), while a negative Δδ RS value was found for H-6 0 (À0.175). Following the MPA rules, these data indicated the S-configuration for C 5 0 in 7.The absolute configurations of C 7 and C 11 in chaetoviridin A (1) have been reported as S. 8 Comparison of the NMR data of chaetoviridins B (2) and D (4) with those of 1 (Supporting Information) suggested the S-configuration for both positions in both compounds. On the other hand, the relative configuration of the C 8 and C 2 0 positions of chaetoviridins B (2) and D (4) was suggested to be cis by Takahashi et al. 8 on the basis of the magnitude of the coupling constants (10.2 Hz in 2 and 9.7 Hz in 4). A qualitative analysis of the NOE experiments confirmed this disposition. In particular, NOE interactions were detected between H-7CH 3 , H-8, and H-2 0 , supporting the S-configuration for C 8 and C 2 0 . Finally, the orientation of the secondary hydroxyl group at C 12 in chaetoviridin D (4) was established by the application of the Mosher's method. In accordance with this method, the corresponding Mosher diastereoisomeric esters 4a and 4b were obtained by treatment of 4 with (R)-and (S)-MTPA acids, respectively. The analysis by 1 H NMR of the resulting esters 4a and 4b revealed negative Δδ SR (δ S À δ R ) values for H-10, H-11, and H-11CH 3 (À0.14, À0.062, and À0.086, respectively) and a positive Δδ SR value for H-13 (þ0.043). Following the MTPA rules, these data indicated the R-configuration for C 12 in chaetoviridin D (4). The absolute configuration of C 5 0 could not be determined by this method, as it was not possible to derivatize the secondary alcohol linked to this carbon. On the basis of above data, the relative configurations of the chaetoviridins B and D were established as indicated in the structures of 2 and 4.Comparison of the NMR data of chaetoviridin C (3) with those of chaetoviridin A (1) (Supporting Information) suggested the S-configuration for C 7 and C 11 . The relative configurations of the C 8 ÀC 2 0 positions of 3 were shown to be cis as in 2 and 4 by NOE difference spectra. In particular, NOE interactions were detected between H-7CH 3 , H-8, and H-2 0 , supporting the Sconfiguration for C 8 and C 2 0. The magnitude of the coupling constant between both protons H-4 0 and H-5 0 (9.1 Hz) was closer to that of 7 (8.1 Hz) than to that of 8 (3.0 Hz), suggesting Journal of Natural Products ARTICLE an anti-disposition between H-4 0 and H-5 0 and the S-configuration for C 4 0 and C 5 0. From these results, the relative configuration of chaetoviridin C was established as indicated in the structure of 3.Compound 9 was assigned the molecular formula C 23 H 25 ClO 5 , as deduced from the HREIMS. The 1 H and 13 C NMR data of 9 (Tables 1 and2) indicated a structure similar to that of chaetoviridin F (6). 9 However, there were some differences in chemical shifts between both compounds. In particular, the deshielded H-5 0 , H-6 0 , and 4 0 -CH 3 carbon signals suggested an opposite configuration at C 4 0 between both compounds. On the basis of these data, the structure of 9 was assigned as 4 0 -epichaetoviridin F.The molecular formula of compound 10 (C 23 H 27 ClO 7 ) was obtained by HREIMS and corroborated by 13 C NMR data. The spectroscopic data of this compound were similar to those of 3 (Supporting Information). However, the 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed a signal at δ 3.82 (m), which correlated in the COSY experiment with the signals corresponding to H-11 (δ H 2.45) and H-13 (δ H 1.19). Furthermore, the 13 C NMR spectrum (Table 2) showed the presence of an additional signal corresponding to a carbon atom attached to a hydroxyl group (δ C 70.8), which was connected to the signal at δ 3.82 (H-12) in the HSQC experiment. These data suggested that compound 10 is a hydroxyl derivative of 3 at C 12 . Due to the small amount obtained of this compound, it was not possible to determine the absolute configuration of the hydroxyl group by Mosher's method. However, the comparison of the NMR data of 10 (Tables 1 and2) with those of chaetoviridin D (4) (Supporting Information) suggested the R-configuration for C 12 . The configurations of C 7 and C 11 were assigned to be S, similar to those reported for azaphilones. 8 On the other hand, the relative configurations of the C 8 ÀC 2 0 positions were shown to be cis as in 3 by NOE difference spectra. In particular, NOE interactions were detected between H-7CH 3 and H-8 and between H-2 0 and H-8, supporting the S-configuration for C 8 and C 2 0 . Finally, the protons of the side chain at C 2 0 showed chemical shifts very similar to those of 3 (Supporting Information). These data together with the magnitude of the coupling constant J 4 0 À5 0 (9.3 Hz) suggested an anti-disposition between H-4 0 and H-5 0 and the S-configuration for C 4 0 and C 5 0. On the basis of these data, the structure of 10 was assigned to 12β-hydroxychaetoviridin C.Chaetoviridin G (11) has the molecular formula C 23 H 25 ClO 5 by HREIMS. Its 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and2) showed signals very similar to those of chaetoviridin E (5). 9 However, the appearance of two doublets at δ H 4.11 and 4.37, showing a vicinal coupling (J = 12.2 Hz), suggested that 11 was the 8,2 0 -dihydro derivative of 5. The configurations at C 7 and C 11 were assigned to be S, similar to those reported for azaphilones. 8 The configurations at C 2 0 ÀC 8 were confirmed to be cis by NOE   12) by HREIMS. This compound corresponds to a dechlorinated derivative of chaetoviridin A (1). The 1 H and 13 C NMR data of this compound were similar to those of 1 (Supporting Information), except for the presence of a signal at δ H 5.31 (s). This singlet was connected to a sp 2 carbon at δ C 105.7 (C 5 ) in the HSQC experiment and to three carbons at δ C 111.0 (C 8a ), 107.9 (C 4 ), and 87.7 (C 7 ) in the HMBC experiment. The remaining signals in the 13 C NMR spectrum along with the chemical shifts and coupling constants appearing in the 1 H NMR spectrum were consistent with the structure shown for compound 12. The configurations of C 7 and C 11 were assigned as S by comparison of the NMR data of 12 with those of 1 (Supporting Information). On the other hand, the orientation of the secondary hydroxyl group was established by the application of the Mosher's method. The (R)-and (S)-MPA esters 12a and 12b were obtained by treatment of 12 with (R)-and (S)-MPA acids, respectively. The negative value of Δδ RS (δ R À δ S ) for H-4 0 CH 3 (À0.063) and the positive value of Δδ RS for H-6 0 (þ0.205) indicated the R-configuration for C 5 0 in chaetoviridin H (12). Finally, the configuration at C 4 0 was assigned as S on the basis of the magnitude of the coupling constant J 4 0 À5 0 (6.1 Hz) and carbon chemical shifts similar to 1.The molecular formula of compound 13 was established as C 23 H 27 ClO 8 by HRESIMS, as well as 1 H and 13 C NMR data. NMR data for chaetoviridin I (13) were similar for the other isolated azaphilones except for the hydrogen at δ 6.00 (s, H-1), attached to the carbon at δ 96.1 in the HSQC experiment, suggesting a ketal group, and the quaternary carbons at δ 72.9 and 64.7. The hydrogen at δ 6.00 (s) showed a correlation in the HMBC experiment with a carbon at δ 156.0 (C-3). The methyl hydrogens at δ 1.76 (s, H-7CH 3 ) showed correlations with the carbon at δ 72.9, and the hydrogen at δ 6.15 (s, H-4) showed a correlation with the carbon at δ 64.7. On the basis of these HMBC correlations C-8 and C-8a positions were assigned for the carbons at δ 72.9 and 64.7, respectively. These data indicate modifications at the 1, 8, and 8a positions for the tricyclic moiety compared with the other azaphilones. Another difference for 13 was the absence of a ketone carbon at δ 191.4À207.0, which is characteristic of the related azaphilones bearing the side chain at C-2 0 . The correlation between the methyl hydrogens at δ 1.11 (d, 4 0 -CH 3 ) and the carbon at δ 167.7, not previously observed for the other compounds, suggested this carbon at δ 167.7 as C-3 0 . Compound 13 could be produced in acidic conditions through the cyclization of the hydroxyl group attached to C 3 0 at the C 1 , producing the dihydropyran ring of chaetoviridin 13 (Figure 2).The isolated compounds were tested in an in vivo pathogenicity assay that involves the infection of C. elegans with Enterococcus faecalis. 13 Using this assay the possibilities of discovering new antibacterial agents, or even prodrugs that need in vivo activation, is higher than traditional in vitro antibacterial assays. In this assay, the nematodes are transferred from their normal laboratory food, Escherichia coli strain OP50, to a lawn of E. faecalis strain MMH594 to establish an infection and subsequently to modified liquid brain-heart infusion medium in 96-well microtiter plates. E. faecalis causes a lethal infection in the C. elegans intestine, and the end point of the assay is dead worms. None of the compounds showed significant ability to promote nematode survival.Thus, six new azaphilones together with six known azaphilones have been identified from the endophyte C. globosum. C. globosum from different biomes has already been reported as prolific producers of bioactive compounds. Other related, new cytotoxic azaphilone derivatives have been isolated from marine fish-derived C. globosum. 14À19 A different endophytic C. globosum strain produced the chemokine receptor CCR-5 inhibitor, with potential as an anti-HIV agent. 20 ' EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were determined with a Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter in CHCl 3 . UV spectra were obtained in CHCl 3 solution on a GBC Cintra 101 diode array spectrophotometer, and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum BX spectrophotometer, series FTIR (Fourier transform infrared). 1 H and 13 C NMR measurements were obtained on Varian Inova 400 and Varian Unity 600 spectrometers with CDCl 3 as solvent. Mass spectra of 1À5 and 7À11 were recorded on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry Agilent-LR and Finningan Mat95 S instruments, and mass spectra of 12 and 13 were obtained on an UltrO-TOF (Bruker-Daltonics, Billarica, MA, USA). HPLC was performed with a Hitachi/Merck L-7100 apparatus equipped with a differential refractometer detector (RI-L7490) and an Intel Pentium computer for analytical system control, data collection, and processing (software Borwin). Purification by means of HPLC was carried out with a silica gel column (LIChroCART 250/10 LIChrospher SI60, 10 μm, 1 cm wide, 25 cm long, or LIChroCART 250/4 LIChrospher SI60, 5 μm, 0.4 cm wide, 25 cm long). TLC was performed on Merck Kiesegel 60 F 254 , 0.25 mm thick. Si gel (Merck) type 9385 was used for column chromatography.Fungal Material. The fungus was isolated from the leaves of Viguiera robusta and identified on the basis of its rDNA sequence as previously reported. 6 A voucher specimen has been deposited at "Laborat orio de Química de Micro-Organismos", FCFRP, USP. The strain is maintained in both sterile water and silica gel (6À12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated) at 10 °C.Culture Conditions. The general procedure adopted for cultivation of the microorganism followed the methodology described by Park et al. 12 C. globosum was grown in 40 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL) containing 200 mL of potato dextrose broth (PDB). Each flask was inoculated with 6 mycelium plugs (1 cm diameter each) from a 7-day-old culture grown on PDA agar and then incubated for 21 days at 25 °C on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm.Extraction and Isolation. The culture broth (8 L) was separated from the mycelium by vacuum filtration and partitioned with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) three times. The mycelium was extracted by maceration with EtOAc. The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the EtOAc extracts were combined after TLC analysis. The crude combined EtOAc extract, a yellow oil (3.50 g), was separated by means of column chromatography using silica gel 60 eluted with n-hexane/ EtOAc (7:3), EtOAc/MeOH (1:1), and MeOH 100%, yielding eight fractions. Subfraction 4 yielded compound 1 (1.87 g). Fraction 3 (89 mg) was subjected to HPLC using a LiChroCART 250-10ÀLiChrospher Si 60 (10 μm) column eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (7:3) at a flow rate of 3 mL min À1 , yielding two subfractions. Subfraction 3.1 (62.4 mg) was submitted to HPLC purification in a normal-phase column (LiChroCART 250-4ÀLiChrospher Si 60, 5 μm) using n-hexane/EtOAc (4:1) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 3 mL min À1 to yield 5 (44 mg) and 11 (16 mg). Fraction 5 (80 mg) was also submitted to both HPLC purification procedures described for fraction 3. In the first HPLC step fraction 5 yielded two subfractions. In the second step subfraction 5.1 (28 mg) yielded 9 (22 mg). Fraction 6 (270 mg) was also submitted to the same first HPLC purification procedure described for fraction 3 to give five subfractions. Subfractions 2À5 correspond to compounds 3 (32 mg), 7 (12 mg), 8 (25 mg), and 2 (141 mg), respectively. Fraction 7 (501 mg) was subjected to silica gel 60 column chromatography eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (2:3) and EtOAc 100%, yielding six subfractions. Subfraction 7.1 (65 mg) was subjected to normal-phase HPLC (LiChroCART 250-10ÀLiChrospher Si 60, 10 μm) with n-hexane/EtOAc (3:2) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 3 mL min À1 , yielding 12 (32 mg) and 13 (11 mg). Subfraction 7.5 (88 mg) was also subjected to normal-phase HPLC using the same conditions used for purification of fraction 1, except for n-hexane/EtOAc (1:4) used as mobile phase, yielding four subfractions. Subfraction 7.5.1 (6 mg) yielded 10 (4 mg) after purification in normal-phase HPLC (LiChroCART 250-4ÀLiChrospher Si 60, 5 μm, eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (2:3) at flow rate of 1 mL min À1 ), subfraction 7.5.2 (26 mg) yielded 4 after crystallization, and subfraction 7.5.3 (12 mg) also yielded 4 (total of 24 mg) after normal-phase HPLC purification (LiChroCART 250-4ÀLiChrospher Si 60, 5 μm, eluted with n-hexane/ EtOAc (4:1) at flow rate of 1 mL min À1 ).5 0 -Epichaetoviridin A (7): orange, amorphous solid; [R] D 20 þ40 (c 0.002, CHCl 3 ); UV (CHCl 3 ) λ max nm (log ε) 307 (0.66), 367 (0.53), 431 (0.15); IR (KBr) ν max 3462, 2966, 2918, 1767, 1685, 1645, 1514, 756 cm À1 ; 1 H and 13 C NMR data see Tables 1 and2 13 C NMR data see Tables 1 and2 X-ray Crystallographic Analysis of 1. Orange crystals of 1 were obtained from n-hexane/EtOAc by slow evaporation. X-ray diffraction data were measured on a Bruker Smart CCD diffractometer with graphitemonochromated Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å ) at 297(1) K. Data collection was based on three ω-scan runs (starting = À34°) at values of φ = 0°, 120°, and 240°with the detector at 2θ = À32°. For each of these runs, 606 frames were collected at 0.3°intervals and 10 s per frame. An additional run at φ = 0°of 100 frames was collected to improve redundancy. The diffraction frames were integrated using the program SAINT, and the integrated intensities were corrected for LorentzÀpolarization effects with SADABS. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined to all 3778 unique F o 2 by full matrix least-squares calculations using SHELXL-97. 21 All the hydrogen atoms were placed at idealized positions and refined as rigid atoms.

In particular, NOE interactions were detected between H-7CH 3 and H-8 and between H-8 and H-2 0 , which is only possible in the case of a β-disposition of the protons H-2 0 and H-8. Finally, the geometry of the double bond C 4 0 ÀC 5 0 was also inferred on the basis of NOE experiments. Irradiation of the signal at δ H 1.94 (H-6 0 ) led to enhancement of the signals at δ H 1.83 (H-4 0 CH 3 ) and 6.80 (H-5 0 ). These results indicated that the configuration of the C 4 0ÀC 5 0 double bond is E.The molecular formula C 23 H 26 O 6 was assigned for chaetoviridin H (
