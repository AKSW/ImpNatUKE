Flavonols from Pterogyne nitens and their evaluation as myeloperoxidase inhibitors
A myeloperoxidase inhibitory kaempferol derivative, namely pterogynoside (1), was isolated from fruits of Pterogyne nitens, along with six known flavonols, kaempferol, afzelin, kaempferitrin, quercetin, isoquercetrin and rutin. The structures of all compounds were elucidated primarily from 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses, as well as by high resolution mass spectrometry. All flavonols were screened to identify secondary metabolites as potential myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitors, and at concentrations of 0.50-50 nM, quercetin (5), isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7) exhibited strong inhibitory effects with IC 50 values of 1.22 ± 0.01, 3.75 ± 0.02 and 3.60 ± 0.02, respectively. The MPO activity detected for the new derivative 1 was markedly decreased (IC 50 10.3 ± 0.03) when compared with known flavonols 5-7, and interestingly increased when tested against ABTS scavenging activity.

IntroductionMyeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-enzyme present in human neutrophils and plays a role in infection and inflammation, converting hydrogen peroxide and chloride to hypochlorous acid and water (Winterbourn et al., 2000). Although hypochlorous acid has important roles in killing microorganisms, it also possesses high reactivity and the ability to damage macromolecules by oxidation (Teixeira et al., 2003). The excessive MPO activity and reactive oxy-gen species (ROS), especially HOCl, production are implicated in many inflammatory processes (Heinecke et al., 1993;Gurel et al., 2004), including atherosclerosis, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease; the search for new myeloperoxidase inhibitors from natural sources has become a staple in drug discovery.Pterogyne nitens (Fabaceae) is popularly named in Brazil as ''tipa ´", ''viraro ´", ''cocal", ''amendoinzeiro", ''amendoim-bravo", according to the region where this plant grows. It is a beautiful legume tree, and the sole member of the genus Pterogyne, which is distributed mainly in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, and can reach a height of 5-12 m. (Burkart, 1952). Its wood is also widely 0031-9422/$ -see front matter Ó 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. doi:10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.01.006 used in building construction and, to our knowledge, there are no reports on ethnomedicinal uses for this species (Lorenzi, 1998).Our previous studies on P. nitens have resulted in the isolation of flavones, and five guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited selective activity towards a DNA repair-deficient strain of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting potential anti-cancer activity (Bolzani et al., 1995). In our continuing interest in searching for new biologically active metabolites from plants of the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest regions, we have investigated the fruits of this plant, collected at the Botanical Garden, Sa ˜o Paulo, in May 2003. We report herein the isolation, and structural elucidation of one new flavonol rhamnoside, namely pterogynoside (1) and six known flavonols: kaempferol (Mitscher et al., 1985), afzelin (Salama et al., 1981), kaempferitrin (Pizzolatti et al., 2003), quercetin, isoquercitrin and rutin (Markham et al., 1978). Additionally, these compounds were screened for MPO inhibitory activity, using a guaiacol oxidation method (Capeille `re-Blandin, 1998). The new flavonol 1 was also analyzed for the scavenging of DPPH and ABTS free radicals activities and its antioxidant potential was evaluated (see Fig. 1).
Results and discussionShade-dried, powdered fruits of P. nitens were first defatted with n-hexane and exhaustively extracted by remaceration with ethanol. The solvent was evaporated at low temperature under reduced pressure to yield a syrup which was suspended in methanol-water (4:1) and then successively partitioned with ethyl acetate and n-butyl alcohol. The resulting fractions were subjected to successive column chromatography separation steps to yield pterogynoside (1) along with six known flavonols.Pterogynoside (1) was isolated as yellow prisms, m.p. 272-273 °C, and gave a positive reaction with ferric chlo-ride, indicating it as a phenol derivative. The IR spectrum exhibited strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydroxyl (3280 cm À1 ), chelated hydroxy group (3265 cm À1 ), conjugated ester (1695 cm À1 ), conjugated ketone (1650 cm À1 ) and aromatic C@C absorptions (1612, 1593, 1550 and 1508 cm À1 ). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions (k max ) (log e) at 316 (4.53) and 297 (4.29), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a flavonol structure (Mabry et al., 1970;Agrawal et al., 1989). The UV spectra recorded in EtOH and shift reagents such as KOH, NaOAc and AlCl 3 suggested the presence of free hydroxy groups at C-4 0 , C-7 and C-5, respectively. Its elemental composition C 29 H 26 O 14 , with 17°of unsaturation, was deduced from its HRESIMS, which showed a deprotonated molecular ion ([MÀH] À ) at m/z 597.5087 (calcd for C 29 H 26 O 14 , 597.5081) consistent with its 13 C NMR data (Table 1, Supporting Information). The CID (collision induced dissociation) experiments using the product ion scan mode (MS 2 ) allowed characterization and establishment of the fragmentation pathway of pterogynoside, with an intense (64%) kaempferol peak at m/z 285 in the negative ion mode. The positive ion mode also gave an intense kaempferol peak at m/z 287. Further MS analysis showed a deprotonated ion peak at m/z 597, and a product ion at m/z 431 indicating the presence of one hexose residue in compound 1. Its 1 H and 13 C NMR and DEPT spectra evi-  167.7 (s) -H-3 00 , H-2 000 OCH 3 -4 000 60.7 (q) 3.77 (s) a Multiplicities were deduced from DEPT 90°and DEPT 135°e xperiments.b Assignments were deduced from HMQC correlations and comparison with literature data (Agrawal et al., 1989).denced the presence of a 5,7,4 00 -trisubstituted flavonol moiety, in addition to 4 000 -methylgallate and a-L-rhamnopyranosyl residues. The assignment of all proton and carbon signals followed from extensive analysis of 1 H-1 H gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC spectra (Table 1). The 13 C NMR spectrum of 1 presented 29 carbons deduced from DEPT 90°, DEPT 135°and gHMQC techniques as one methyl, thirteen methines, one methoxyl and fourteen quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at d 167.7 and d 179.5, attributed to ester and ketone groups, respectively. The 1 H NMR and 1 H-1 H gCOSY spectra (Table 1) showed an A 2 M 2 spin system assigned to the hydrogen signals at d 7.74 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H-2 00 , 6 0 ) and 6.87 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H-3 0 , 5 0 ) attributed to a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring; and a pair of doublets at d 6.10 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-6) and 6.29 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-8) for the trioxygenated A ring of compound 1, suggesting a kaempferol moiety for its aglycone. Additionally, the 1 H NMR resonances at d 5.38 and 0.89 evidenced an arhamnopyranosyl moiety, which was confirmed by observation of correlated signals at d 103.6, d and d 17.7 in the HMQC spectrum. A cross-peak between the signals for C-3 (d136.0) and the anomeric hydrogen H-1 00 (d 5.38) in the gHMBC spectrum indicated the position of the rhamnosyl unit at C-3 of the kaempferol moiety. Further analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) indicated an additional methylgallate unit in compound 1, which was placed at C-3 00 of the rhamnopyranosyl moiety due to the downfield chemical shift observed for H-3 00 (d 5.11), and a gHMBC cross-peak of H-3 00 with the carbonyl ester C-7 000 (d 167.7). An additional gHMBC correlation was observed between the signal at d 141.2 (C-4 000 ) and d 3.77 (OMe) which confirmed the position of the methoxy group at C-4 000 . Hence, the structure of pterogynoside (1) was completely elucidated, and established as kaempferol-3-O-(3 00 -O-4 000 -methylgallate-a-L-rhamnoside. Additionally, six known flavonols were isolated and identified as kaempferol (2) (Mitscher et al., 1985), afzelin (3) (Salama et al., 1981), kaempferitrin (4) (Pizzolatti et al., 2003), quercetin (5), isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7) (Markham et al., 1978). Their identification was based on analyses of 1 H, 13 C NMR and MS data, as well as by comparison with authentic material available in our laboratory. Furthermore, this is the first report of flavonol glycosides from P. nitens.Although a broad spectrum of biological activities has already been demonstrated for flavonoids (Middleton et al., 2000;Cuzzocrea et al., 2001;Havsteen, 2002;Mollace et al., 2005), few studies have been devoted to the myeloperoxidase inhibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols (Kato et al., 2003).Myeloperoxidase production is triggered by inflammatory mediators resulting in acceleration of superoxide anion (O À2 ) conversion to hydrogen peroxide an other ROS especially HOCl, which reacts further to generate singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) and hydroxyl radical (HO Å ) as powerful oxidizing agents. Such species are involved in oxidative stress-related diseases as atherosclerosis, cancer, Alzheimer disease etc., which evidences the importance of research towards new MPO inhibitors.All isolates were assayed for their MPO inhibitory activity (Table 2), evidencing a key role of the B ring oxygenation pattern on the level of activity. Compounds 5-7, presenting a catechol derived B-ring, exhibited IC 50 values of 1.22, 3.75 and 3.60 nM, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds 1-4, which are kaempferol derivatives, thus presenting a monohydroxy phenolic B ring. The aglycone quercetin (5) was used as positive control (Kato et al., 2003) and presented higher activity than its glucosides isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7), suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-3 for enhancement of the MPO inhibitory activity. This trend has also been observed for kaempferol derivatives 1-4, as the glucosides pterogynoside (1), afzelin (3) and kaempferitrin (4) exhibited IC 50 values of 10.3, 13.9 and 15.8 nM, respectively, and were less active than the aglycone kaempferol (2, IC 50 8.3 nM). These results indicate a clear positive correlation between MPO inhibitory activity and antioxidant properties of flavonoids as shown in Table 2. The catechol on B ring and the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moieties have been extensively pointed out as the main features in flavonoids associated with enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant activity (Van Acker et al., 1996). The presence of a galloyl group, e.g. in flavonoids, has also been associated with increased antioxidant capacity (Heijnen et al., 2002). In this respect, the presence of an additional galloyl unit in compound 1 might explain its higher MPO inhibitory activity, when compared with compounds 3 and 4.The antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging effects using two different assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay. Quercetin derivatives 5-7 showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with values of IC 50 (lg/mL) of 4.12, 4.37 and 4.85, and DPPH with values of 2.60, 2.77 and 3.15, respectively, than kaempferol derivatives 1-4 (Table 2), indicating a major role of the catechol moiety on the B-ring b Quercetin was used as positive control (Kato et al., 2003).of flavonoids for enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, among compounds 1-4, increasing activities were observed for pterogynoside (1) and kaempferol (2), which confirms the importance of the free hydroxyl groups on C-3 (in 2) and the enhancement of RSA due to the galloyl group (in 1) in both assays. Among compounds 5-7, quercetin (5) exhibited higher activity than its 3-O-glucosyl derivatives 6 and 7, which confirmed the influence of the free-hydroxy group at C-3 for potentiating the free radical scavenging activity of flavonoids.
Concluding remarksIn summary, flavonoids with either the catechol moiety or a,b-unsaturated carbonyl with the free hydroxyl group at C-3 have shown best anti-radicalar and MPO inhibitory properties, which corroborates the involvement of MPO in redox processes. The absence of such features in pterogynoside (1) has been counteracted by the galloyl moiety on C-3 00 leading to MPO inhibitory activity comparable to kaempferol (2), and higher free radical scavenging ability than 2 or its glucosides 3 and 4.Flavonols from P. nitens presented potent inhibition towards the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory enzyme myeloperoxidase and potent radical scavenging effects, which may be particularly important because they are easily available in the plant kingdom (Middleton et al., 2000) and are able to protect biological systems against stress phenomena such as lipid peroxidation, as shown for a variety of kaempferol derivatives exhibiting high antioxidant selectivity (Gebre-Mariam et al., 2005), and for quercetin and its derivatives, which have been shown to protect cells against H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress and calcium dysregulation (Wang and Joseph, 1999).

Plant material
Extraction and isolationThe shade-dried fruits (2 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with n-hexane (15 L Â 5, at room temperature, for two weeks) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with EtOH (25 L Â 5) at room temperature. The combined ethanol extracts were concentrated in vacuo (< 40 °C) to yield 8.0 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with CH 3 OH:H 2 O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 2.5 and 3.8 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue was subjected to silica gel (230-400 mesh) CC eluted with EtOAc/MeOH gradient (0-100% MeOH) to afford eight fractions (E1-E8) and free aglycones 2 (220.9 mg) and 5 (150.8 mg). Fraction E6 (397.8 mg) was further purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH:-H 2 O:AcOH (58:42:0.1), UV detection at 254 nm; flow rate 10 mL/min], affording acylated flavonol 1 (115.9 mg) and two flavonol monoglycosides 3 (82.9 mg) and 6 (78.7 mg).The n-BuoH residue was dissolved into MeOH and submitted to gel filtration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 23 fractions (B1-B23). After TLC comparison, fractions B12-B19 were combined (488.3 mg) and purified by RP-HPLC using MeOH:H 2 O:AcOH (68:32:0.1) as mobile phase, with UV detection at 254 nm and flow rate of 12 mL/min, affording flavonol diglycosides 4 (150.7 mg) and 7 (299.0 mg). 
Kaempferol-3-O-(3
Assay for MPO inhibitory activityMPO inhibitory effects of flavonols 1-7 were evaluated through guaiacol oxidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 nM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mM). The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calculated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiacol (70 mM) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at different sample concentrations of compounds 1-7 (0.50-50 nM) and in the their absence (Kato et al., 2003). The IC 50 values were calculated from the rates calculated on the basis of inhibition percentage expressed in concentration-response curves.
Evaluation of radical scavenging activity (RSA)Radical scavenging activity (RSA) of compounds 1-7 was determined using DPPH Å (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS Å+ [2,2 0 -azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as reagents. Sample solutions of 1-7 and Trolox Ò at various concentrations (10-100 lg/ml) in EtOH were individually added to 0.6 mM DPPH in EtOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 30 min (Soares et al., 1997;Duarte-Almeida et al., 2006). Remaining DPPH was determined colorimetrically at 531 nm by blanking against absolute ethanol. ABTS Å+ was prepared by reacting 5 mL of ABTS (7 mM) water soln. with 88 lL of 140 mM potassium persulphate (ratio 1:0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12-16 h before use. Prior to assay ABTS Å+ stock soln. was diluted with KH 2 PO 4 / K 2 HPO 4 (100 mM, pH 7.0 diluted 1:10 before use) buffer soln. (ratio 1:88). One milliliter ABTS Å+ was added to glass test tubes containing different concentrations of compound 1 and Trolox Ò (0.5-7.0 lg/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical scavenging activity (Pellegrini et al., 1999). Anti-radical abilities against ABTS Å+ and DPPH Å species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (inhibition%) calculated from the equation: Inhibition % = [1 À (A sample /A) Â 100], where A is test absorbance without sample (only solvent and free radicals) and A sample is test absorbance with compounds 1-7 or Trolox Ò .Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.
