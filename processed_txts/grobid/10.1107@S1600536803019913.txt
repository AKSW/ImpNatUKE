The title compound (alternative names 7,8-dimethoxydictammine and 4,7,8-trimethoxyfuro[2,3-b]quinoline), C 14 H 13 NO 4 , is a natural product extracted from Adiscanthus fusci¯orus (Rutaceae). Our biochemical tests show that it has inhibitory activity against the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) from Leishmania, a tropical parasite causing endemic disease in poor countries. It crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group P2 1 /c, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, and has at least two CÐHÁ Á ÁO intermolecular interactions, leading to the formation of centrosymmetric dimers.
CommentLeishmaniasis is a disease caused by a protozoal parasite of the order Kinetoplastid. According to the World Heath Organization reports (WHO, 1998), 88 countries are affected, with 12 million infected people and approximately 350 million people at risk. The need for new drugs for the treatment of the leishmaniasis infections comes from a lack of safe drugs and the serious secondary effects observed in available chemotherapy (McGreevy & Marsden, 1986). The purine nucleotide salvage pathway in Kinetoplastid is a potential target for the development of new drugs, owing to its dependence on that biosynthetic pathway (Berens et al., 1995). In Kinetoplastid, the phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) protein family is responsible for purine nucleotide salvage. Looking for new bioactive substances, potentially useful against leishmaniasis, we used the PRTase adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) from L. tarentolae as a model system to screen the inhibitory capacity of several small molecule compounds from Brazilian plants.The screening was performed using the APRT inhibitory assay, either in the presence of extracts or with the puri®ed compound, and was monitored spectrophotometrically (Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1980). The title compound, (I), was isolated from A. fusci¯orus extracts and has been structurally investigated because of its inhibitory activity against APRT. Enzymatic tests of (I) at 50 mg/ml show an inhibition activity of 68%. Further investigations by molecular docking and dynamic simulations will be performed to study the interactions Acta Cryst. (2003). E59, o1503±o1505 between this compound and the APRT active site. In light of this interest, structural characterization will give us important information with respect to the interaction mode of compound (I) with APRT, and allow the investigation of possible inhibition of that compound by other PRTases.With the aim of obtaining more accurate structural data for comparison of (I) and other inhibitors against APRT enzyme, and in order to use this information in molecular docking and dynamic simulations, we undertook a structure determination at 120 K. An ORTEP view (Farrugia, 1997) of compound (I), together with the atom-labelling scheme, is shown in Fig. 1. All bond lengths and angles of this compound are close to normal values (Allen et al., 1983). The crystallographic structure of (I), measured at room temperature, has been previously published (Cox et al., 1989).The crystal packing of (I) does not show any strong hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, two weak intermolecular interactions of the type CÐHÁ Á ÁO (C10ÐH10Á Á ÁO3 i , C12Ð H12Á Á ÁO3 ii ) and two of the type CÐHÁ Á ÁN (C10ÐH10Á Á ÁN i and C14ÐH14Á Á ÁN iii ) stabilize the three-dimensional structure (symmetry codes as in Table 1). The latter type links two neighbouring molecules in a centrosymmetric dimeric form, as shown in Fig. 2. The C10ÐH10Á Á ÁO3 i interaction is responsible for the formation of in®nite chains along the b axis, and C12ÐH12Á Á ÁO3 ii for the formation of in®nite chains along the c axis. All structural details of the intermolecular contacts for compound (I) were interpreted as hydrogen bonds on geometrical grounds (Ellena et al., 2001).
ExperimentalThe roots and leaves of A. fusci¯orus were collected from the Manaus region of the Brazilian Amazon forest in December 2000. An authenticated specimen was deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto de Pesquisas da Amazonia±INPA (code 189859). The powdered parts (roots 2.380 kg and leaves 1.040 kg) were extracted successively with hexane (10 l) and methanol (8.5 l). The crude hexane crude extract of the root (5.0 g) was extracted by chromatography on a silica gel column (È Â h = 28 Â 2 cm). Fractions 6 and 7 were combined and subjected to silica gel column chromatography, using the isocratic system (hexane/ethyl acetate 7:3). Fraction 8 was collected according to TLC analysis (normal phase) and fractions 6 and 7 were combined and subjected to CCDP using hexane/ethyl acetate 7:3 as the mobile phase. 10 mg of compound (I) were obtained; this crystallized by vapour diffusion as a prismatic, light yellow solid, using 1:1 hexane/dichloromethane as solvent.
