DISTRIBUTION OF DIARYLPROPANOIDS IN AMAZONIAN VIROLA SPECIES*
Virolane [1-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-propane] and virolanol [2-hydroxy-l-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-propane], two diarylpropanoids recently isolated from the wood of Virolu multinervia Ducke' (Myristicaceae, INPA 2855121157, Ducke Reserve Manaus), were found to occur additionally in the wood of V. venosa (Benth.) Warb. (INPA 1947/13996, Ducke Reserve, Manaus), V. divergens Ducke (INPA 2818/14787, Ducke Reserve, Manaus), V. melinonii (Benoist) A.C.Sm. (INPA 1315/10356), Navio Mt., AmapB), V. pavonis (A.DC.) A.C.Sm. (INPA 599/5160, Ducke Reserve, Manaus) and V. surinamensis (Roland) Warb. (INPA 632/5593, Benjamin Constant, Amazonas); and to be absent from V. calophyZZu Spr. ex Warb. (INPA 2036/14207, Ducke Reserve, Manaus), V. elongata (Benth.) Warb. (CodajBs, Amazonas), V. rufila Warb. (INPA 2001/14013, Ducke Reserve, Manaus) and V. multicostata Ducke (IPEAN 31005/--, Madeira river, Pa&). Among the group of species which contain diarylpropanoids, V. multinervia and V. venosa were previously examined phytochemically, and it was shown that their bark, root and leaves are almost devoid of alkaloids.2 In contrast, most of the species of the second group are renowned hallucinogenic plants, due to the presence of tryptamine derivatives2 in V. theiodora (Spr. ex Bth.) Warb., by some considered to be synonymous with V. rufula,3~4 V. rufula and V. calophylla; and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-/?carboline derivatives in V. theiodora and V. rufula. V. cuspidata (Benth.) Warb. considered to be synonymous with V. elongata4*5 contains 1,2,3,4_tetrahydroharman derivatives.6 EXPERIMENTAL Trunk wood samples of Virolu species (INPA, Manaus, or IPEAN, BelCm, No. of wood sample/No. of herbarium sample) were reduced to saw dust and extracted with CHQ. The extracts were chromatographed on a silica (Merck, 0~05-0~20 mm) column. The fractions eluted successively with benzene and with CHC13 were compared by co-TLC (Merck, Kieselgel G, visualization of spots with I*-vapour) with authentic samples. &He-fraction (developing solvent CHCI,-Me,CO, 9 : 1): sitosterol (RP 0.55), virolane (RZ 0.65). CHCl,-fraction (developing solvent CHCl,-Me,CO, 17 : 3): unknown cmpd. (Rf 0.53), virolanol (R, 0.57) When present, virolane and virolanol appeared in approx. equal amounts (as determined by the spot areas). * Part II in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Myristicaceae".
