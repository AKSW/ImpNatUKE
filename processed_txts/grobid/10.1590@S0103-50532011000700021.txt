Prenylindole Alkaloids from Raputia praetermissa (Rutaceae) and their Chemosystematic Significance
O extrato diclorometano do caule de Raputia praetermissa levou ao isolamento de quatro compostos novos, 4-desóxi-raputindol C (1), raputimonoindol A-B (2, 3) e hexadecanil 2-hidróxi-4-metóxi-cinnamato (5), juntamente com os alcalóides 5-(4-metóxi-metilfuran-2-il)-1H-indol (raputimonoindol C), furoquinolinos maculosidine, robustine, evolitrine e dictamnine. O estudo do extrato hexano levou ao isolamento de N-metil-4-metóxi-quinolin-2(1H)-ona, skimmianina, cicloartenona, sitosterol, stigmasterol e sitostenona. Os alcalóides antranílicos isolados indicam que o gênero possui afinidade química relevante com aqueles da tribo Cusparieae, mas difere de Neoraputia devido à ausência de alcalóides prenilindois neste último, cujas espécies foram anteriormente incluídas em Raputia.The dichloromethane extract from the stems of Raputia praetermissa afforded four new compounds, 4-deoxyraputindole C (1), raputimonoindole A-B (2, 3), and hexadecanyl 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-cinnamate (5), besides the alkaloids 5-(4-methoxymethylfuran-2-yl)-1H-indole (raputimonoindole C), furoquinolines maculosidine, robustine, evolitrine and dictamnine. The hexane extract yielded N-methyl-4-methoxyquinolin-2(1H)-one, skimmianine, cycloartenone, sitosterol, stigmasterol and sitostenone. The anthranilate alkaloid content indicates that the genus is strongly related to those included in Cusparieae tribe, but differs from Neoraputia by the absence of prenylindole alkaloids in the late, whose species have previously been placed in Raputia.

IntroductionThe Raputia genus was established by Aublet in 1775, 1 and based on morphological characteristics of R. aromatica Aubl. Emmerich later dismembered this genus, 1 placing most of the species into Neoraputia Emmerich, Sigmatanthus Huber ex Emmerich, and Raputiarana Emmerich. Following the research of Kallunki and Pirani, 2-5 a total of eleven species have now been included in the Raputia genus: R. aromatica Aubl., R. maroana (R. S. Cowan) Kallunki, R. neblinensis (R. S. Cowan) Kallunki, R. ulei (K. Krause) Kallunki, R. brevipedunculata Kallunki, R. megalantha Kallunki, R. simulans Kallunki, R. amazonica (Huber) Kallunki (synonym: Ravenia amazonica Huber), R. szczerbanii (Steyerm.) Kallunki (synonym: Lubaria szczerbanii Steyerm.), R. hirsuta (Gereau) Kallunki and R. praetermissa Pirani & Kallunki. Raputia and Neoraputia are assigned to the tribe Cusparieae and are distributed from Venezuela and French Guiana to Amazonian Colombia, Peru and Brazil. 5 Previous investigations of Neoraputia reported the presence of eleven polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 5,6-(2",2"-dimethylpyrano)flavones, one 6,7-(2",2"-dimethylpyrano)flavone and one flavanone from N. alba (Engler) Emmerich; 6,7 five polymethoxylated flavones and two flavanones, 2'-hydroxy-3,4,4',5,6'pentamethoxychalcone, three 5',6'-(2",2"-dimethylpyrano)polymethoxylated chalcones from N. magnifica var. magnifica (Engler) Emmerich; 8,9 ten polymethoxylated flavonoids, six flavones, three 6,7-(2",2"-dimethylpyrano) flavones and one 6-(3"-hydroxy,3"-methyl-trans-but-1"enyl)flavone from N. paraensis. 10,11 A reinvestigation of N. paraensis searching for alkaloids afforded flindersine, skimmianine, 8-methoxyflindersine and dictamnine. 12 Vol. 22, No. 7, 2011   C-glycosylflavones were also reported from N. paraensis, 13 which was cited as Raputia paraensis, but this species was transferred to Neoraputia by Emmerich. 1 The first investigation about the chemistry of Raputia reported the presence of cyclopentyl bisindole alkaloids raputiindoles A-D from R. simulans Kllunki. 14 In this paper we report a phytochemical study on R. praetermissa Pirani & Kallunki, and the chemosystematic significance of isolated compounds is discussed in order to clarify the relationships between Raputia and Neoraputia.
Results and DiscussionThe dichloromethane extract from the stems of Raputia praetermissa afforded four prenylindole alkaloids (1-4), a cinnamic acid derivative (5) (Figure 1), and furoquinoline alkaloids maculosidine, robustine, evolitrine 15 and dictamnine. 16 The hexane extract yielded N-methyl-4-methoxyquinolin-2(1H)-one, 17 skimmianine, 17 cycloartenone, 18 sitosterol, stigmasterol and sitostenone.Compound 1, C 26 H 26 N 2 (HREIMS), was identified as a bisindole alkaloid. The presence of two indole nucleus was suggested by an UV absorption maximum at 328 nm, an IR band at 3426 cm -1 (NH), and 1 H NMR signals for N-H protons at d 8.00 and 8.04 (brs, no correlation in the HSQC spectrum) (Table 1), which in the COSY experiments showed cross peaks with the 1 H signals at d H 7.14 (dd, 3.2, 2.5 Hz), 6.50 (ddd, 3.2, 2.5, 1.0 Hz), 7.11 (dd, 3.0, 2.5 Hz) and 6.44 (ddd, 3.0, 2.5, 1.0 Hz), respectively. These signals were then assigned to 2N-H (d 8.00 and 8.04), 2H-a (d H 7.14 and 7.11) and 2H-b (d H 6.50 and 6.44) of the indole rings, respectively. HMBC cross peaks (Figure 2 led to the assignment of a 5',6'-dialkylindole system. Moreover, the observed cross peaks between the 1 H signals at d H 4.07 (H-6), 2.43 (H-5a) and 1.81 (H-5b), and the 13 C signals for C-5', C-6' and 48.5 (quaternary carbon, C-3) suggested a 3,3,6-trisubstituted cyclopentyl fused to the indole ring at C-5' and C-6'. An isobutene group was identified from the 1 H NMR signals at d H 5.22 (dsep, 9.0, 1.0), 1.82 (br s, 3H), and 1.79 (br s, 3H), assigned to olefinic proton and methyl groups, respectively. This was supported by the HMBC experiments which showed correlations from the olefinic proton at d H 5.22 to the methyl carbons at d c 25.9 and 18.3. The isobutene group was connected at C-6 due to coupling of H-6 to the olefinic proton at d H 5.22. A methyl group must be connected at C-3 due to the observed HMBC cross peaks between its 1 H signal at d 3H 1.59 and the 13  attachment of the ethylenyl bridge to C-3 and C-5'' was evidenced from HMBC correlations H-1 (d H 6.13)/C-3, C-4'' and H-2 (d H 6.40)/C-3, C-6'. These spectral characteristics are in agreement with those published for raputindole C (6, Figure 3), isolated from Raputia simulans. 14 The main difference observed in the1 H and 13 C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and2) of compound 1, when compared to those of 6, was the replacement of the signal for an oxymethylene by a methyl singlet (C-4, d 3H 1.59, d C 27.1). The relative stereochemistry of compound 1, named as 4-deoxyraputindole C, was determined from gNOESY experiments. The nOes of H-2, H-1, and H-5a, coming from H-6, indicated that H-6 and the ethylenylindole system are on the same side of the five-membered ring, whereas nOe between H-5b and CH 3 -4, required the methyl group to be anti (b) to H-6, and syn to the isobutene chain.Compounds 2-4 showed the spectral characteristic of a 5-substituted-1H-indole alkaloid (Tables 1,2). The 13 C NMR spectrum (Table 2) revealed resonances for C-2 to C-7a in close agreement with those for the corresponding carbons in the structural unit 5-substituted-1H-indole of compound 1, except for C-5 whose chemical shift was affected by a different substituent. Elemental analysis and MS indicated the molecular formula to be C 18 H 21 NO for compound 2, requiring the presence of an aliphatic chain of 10 carbons and one oxygen. A heterocyclic oxolane was identified from the 1 H NMR spectrum, which showed a proton at d H 2.73 (td, 7.0, 5.  As commented above compounds 2-4 showed the spectral characteristic of a 5-substituted-1H-indole alkaloid. Elemental analysis and MS indicated the molecular formula to be C 14 H 11 NO 3 and C 14 H 13 NO 2 for compounds 3 and 4, respectively, requiring the presence of an aliphatic chain of 6 carbons (C 6 H 5 O 3 and C 6 H 7 O 2 , respectively) and indole nucleus (C 8 H 6 N). Their 1 H NMR resonances, when compared to those of 2, showed low field shifts for the disubstituted furan ring potons. In  The 1 H NMR resonances for compound 4, when compared to those of 2, showed low field shifts for the disubstituted furan ring potons. In compound 4, the main difference observed in the 1 H NMR, when compared with 3, was the replacement of the resonance for a carbomethoxy group by two 1 H singlets at d 2H 4.11 (d C 66.0) and d 3H 3.44 (d C 57.6) from a methoxymethylene group. This was supported by the mass spectrum which showed a fragment at m/z 197 [C 14 H 13 NO 2 -H 2 CO] +• . These signals together with the mass and 13 C NMR spectral data are consistent with 4 being 5-(4-methoxymethylfuran-2yl)-1H-indole, which has previously been isolated from Raputia simulans Kallunki. 19 However, the isolation of 5-(4-methoxymethylfuran-2-yl)-1H-indole was cited without spectroscopic data in an congress whose abstracts were published in Planta Medica Proceedings. 19 Thus, its spectroscopic data are cite here for the first time, and it was named raputimonoindole C.The cinnamic acid (5)   13 C signal at d 167.3 (C-1'). The presence of a hexadecanyl chain was corroborated by the MS spectrum, which showed an ion at m/z 279 [HC≡C-COO-(CH 2 ) 14 -CH 2 ] + . The new compound was therefore identified as hexadecanyl 2-hydroxy-4methoxy-cinnamate (5). The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of its 13 C NMR spectrum with that of 4-hydroxy-2-methoxy-cinnamic acid. 20 A number of 3,5-and 3,6-diprenylated indoles have been reported for the Annonaceae genera Isolona, [21][22][23] Uvaria, 22 Annonidium, 24 Monodora, 25 Hexalobus, 26 Asteranthe, 27 Greenwayodendron, 28 and Polyalthia. 29 However, there are only a few examples of 3-, 5-, 6-and 7-and 3,7-prenylated indoles reported in the Rutaceae genera Raputia, 14 Esenbeckia, 30,31 Murraya, [32][33][34] Merrillia 35 and Glycosmis. 36,37 Four bisindoles (6-9; Figure 3) similar to compound 1 have been isolated from Raputia simulans. 14 One bisindole, yuehchukene, which may be regarded as the product of Diels-Alder-type condensation of two 3-isopentenylindoles, occurs in Murraya species. 32 While several bisindoles derived from 2-prenyltryptamine have been isolated from Flindersia species (Rutaceae), 38 pyrano [3,2-b]indole skeleton (koniamborine), a novel type of alkaloid was isolated from Boronella koniambiensis (Rutaceae). 39 The anthranilate alkaloid content found in R. praetermissa indicates that the genus is strongly related to those included in Cusparieae tribe. As mentioned in the introduction, the polimethoxylated flavonoids form an extremely good marker for the Neoraputia. Their use in this context shows that R. praetermissa differs substantially from Neoraputia species, and reinforce its inclusion in Raputia genus. Furthermore, the prenylindole alkaloids have been reported only from Esenbeckia and Raputia in Cusparieae, thus suggesting an affinity of this tribe with subfamily Aurantioideae, where similar prenylindoles occur in Murraya, [33][34][35] Merrillia 36 and Glycosmis. 37,38 It is noteworthy that Neoraputia shares with Murraya and Citrus a propensity for producing polymethoxylated flavonoids, 9,12,40,41 showing also chemical affinity with Aurantioideae.

Extraction and isolationGround stems (4.4 kg) were extracted 3 times at room temperature using hexane, followed by CH 2 Cl 2 and MeOH. The concentrated hexane extract (13.3 g) was subjected to silica gel (230-400 mesh) column chromatography with successive elution with hexane, CH 2 Cl 2 , EtOAc and MeOH, yielding 6 fractions. Fraction 2 was flash rechromatographed twice on silica gel with successive elution with hexane, CH 2 Cl 2 , EtOAc and MeOH, and then by preparative TLC (silica gel; hexane-acetone 9:1), yielding cycloartenone (10 mg). Fraction 3 was flash rechromatographed twice as above, and then by gel permeation column chromatography (Sephadex LH 20, CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH 2:8) affording N-methyl-4-methoxyquinolin-2(1H)-one (30 mg). Fraction 4 was chromatographed on silica gel and Florisil (1:1) with hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient elution to give two fractions (A and B). Fraction A was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel and eluted with hexane-acetone gradient, yielding a mixture of sitosterol and stigmasterol. Fraction B was purified by preparative TLC (silica gel; hexane-acetone 9:1), yielding sitostenone (60 mg). Fraction 5 was chromatographed on silica gel and Florisil (1:1) with hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient elution to give skimmianine (50 mg).The concentrated dichloromethane extract (30.0 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (70-230 mesh) under vacuum. Elution with hexane, CH 2 Cl 2 , EtOAc and MeOH yielded 4 fractions. Fraction 1 was flash rechromatographed on silica gel with hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, yielding compound 1 (700 mg) and a new fraction C. Fraction C was flash rechromatographed twice as above, and then by preparative TLC (silica gel; hexane-acetone 6:1), yielding compound 5. Fraction 2 was chromatographed on silica gel and Florisil (1:1) with hexane-acetone-MeOH gradient elution to give new fractions D, E and F. Fractions D and E were rechromatographed over Sephadex LH 20 (MeOH) to give compounds 2 and 4, respectively. Fraction F was flash rechromatographed on silica gel with hexane-acetone-MeOH gradient elution, yielding robustine (50 mg). Fraction 3 was rechromatographed as above using hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH gradient to yield two fractions. Both fractions were rechromatographed over Sephadex LH 20 (MeOH-CH 2 Cl 2 2:8) affording maculosidine (80 mg), and a new fraction containing compound 3 which was purified by preparative TLC (silica gel; hexane-acetone 5:1). Fraction 4 was rechromatographed on silica gel and Florisil (1:1) with hexane-acetone-MeOH gradient elution to give evolitrine (50 mg) and dictamnine 120 mg).

This structural unit was corroborated by the MS base-peak at m/z 223.13387 (100.0%) resulting from C-3-C-2 cleavage. The 1 H NMR spectrum also showed signals for three hydrogens with ortho and meta coupling constants, d H 7.50 (d, 0.7 Hz), 7.23 (dd, 8.4, 0.7 Hz) and 7.22 (d, 8.4 Hz), suggesting the second indole nucleus to be monosubstituted. In adition, the presence of a trans-disubstituted double bond was evidenced by two vinylic protons at d H 6.13 (d C 126.8) and 6.40 (d, 16.0 Hz; d C 136.0) with a vicinal coupling constant of 16.0 Hz. From HMBC experiments the observed cross peak between the signal with meta coupling constant at d H 7.50 and the 13 C signal for C-3'' (d C 102.7), permited the assignment of the signal at d H 7.50 to H-4'' (C-4'', d C 118.7). The meta coupling constant for H-4'' indicated that C-5'' Prenylindole Alkaloids from Raputia praetermissa (Rutaceae)

Observed HMBC cross peaks between the 1 H signals at d H 2.73 (H-3') and 4.64 (H-2') with the 13 C signals at This was supported by the mass spectrum which showed fragment at m/z 211 [C 18 H 21 NO -C 4 H 8 ] +• . The 1 H-1 H coupling between the methylene at d H 2.28 and H-3' (d H 2.73) indicated the linkage of the isopentene chain to C-3'. An exomethylene (dd C 132.7 (C-5) and 119.1 (C-4), respectively, as well asthose of H-5'a and H-5'b (d H 4.44 and 4.65) with C-3'(d C 51.6), suggested the attachment of the heterocyclicoxolane to C-5 of the indole nucleus. The presence of anisopentene group was deduced from the proton resonancesat d H 5.12 (tsep, 7.0, 1.2, H-8'), 1.64 (br s, 3H-10'), 1.60(br s, 3H-11'), 2.28 (br t, 7.0, 2H-7'), and corroborated bythe HMBC correlation between the methyl and methyleneprotons with the olefinic carbons at d C 132.7 (C-9') and121.7 (C-8').H 4.99, 4.97, J 2.3, 2H-6';

The nOes of the H-4 and H-6, coming from H-3', indicated that H-3' and the indole system must be on the same side of the oxolane ring. The above data confirmed the structure of 2, here named as raputimonoindole A.

In addition, the 1 H NMR showed signals for one methoxyl group at d H 3.92 (s, 3H; d C 55.9), three aromatic hydrogens at d H 7.07 (dd, 8.1, 1.7 Hz), 7.03 (d, 1.7 Hz) and 6.91 (d, 8.1 Hz), clearly indicating the aromatic ring to be 1,2,4-trisubstituted.
