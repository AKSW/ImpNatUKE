NEOLIGNANS FROM AN ANIBA SPECIES*
Aniba burchellii Kosterm. contains the neolignan burchellin (la) [2] whose biosynthesis probably involves oxidative coupling of isoeugenol and eugenol units [3]. Fractionation of a C6H6extract of an Aniba sp. akin to the gigantifilia 0. C. Schmidt [4]-guianensisAubl. [5]-hostmanniana (Nees) Mez [6]-group, whose classification will be possible upon completion of the revision of Lauraceae by Dr. K. Kubitzki, Hamburg, gave 3 additional burchellin analogues (lc, Id, le), also 2 a-allylcyclohexadienones(2b, 2c), 2 Oallylphenols (3c, 7), 2 C-allylphenols (4b, 4d) and a bicyclo [3,2,l]octane derivative (9). The formation of the compounds belonging to structural types 2, 3 (=7) and 4 can best be explained by * Part 30 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae". For Part 29 see Ref. [l]. Taken from part of the DOCtorate thesis presented by J.B.F. to the Universidade de Sgo Paulo (1975). Sponsored by Ministkrio do Planejamento (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos S.A.) through Academia Brasileira de Ci&ncias and by Funda&o de Amparo g Pesquisa do Estado de so Paulo.t Instituto National de Pesquisas da Amazania, Conselho National de Pesquisas, Manaus. sequential Cope, retro-Claisen and Claisen rearrangements of compounds belonging to type 1. Thus, although lb and 8 were not isolated during the present work, their natural occurrence is highly probable. In the laboratory, these reactions require high temperatures (Table 1). The instability of burchellin (la) upon treatment with 4 N KOH in MeOH at reflux temp. is known [2] and slight decomposition of le and 2c in boiling EtOH-C,H,NEt, 19: 1 was observed. Under plant extraction conditions, however, i.e. in refluxing neutral or acid treated CsH, or EtOH, le and 2c are completely stable. Compounds belonging to all 4 structural types, including the missing links 2a, 2d, 2e, 3a, 3b, 3d, 3e, 4a, 4c and 4e, may thus occur naturally.Structural assignments of type 1 compounds were based on comparison of data with published data for la. With the exception of signals due to differential substitution, significant PMR-spectral similarities and dissimilarities (Table 2) showed lc, like burchellin (la), to be a 2,3-tram derivative (Me-3 7 8.8) and Id and le to be 2,3-cis  2) were clearly again 2,3-t1~1rzs derivatives (Me-3 t 8.6) supporting the ally1 group on a sp3-C (CH, r 7.6). Since one of their methoxyls (T 7.0), however. had also to be placed on a sp3-C, and only one flllly substituted sp3-C can exist in these molecules. an r,/~L;~,<i rather than an K/Y-X',/? unsaturated cyclohexadienone system characterizes these compounds and determined, as expected [2]. the appearance of UV maxima at relatively higher wavelenth (315 mn, against 260 nm in all compounds of type 1). IR carbonyl maxima present at 1640~11~' in compounds of type 1 and 1685 cm-. ' in compounds of type 2, are absent from the spectra of compounds belonging to types 3, 4. 5 and 6. These are. indeed, either 2,3-tva~u (3~; 4a, 4b. 4c: 5~. 5b. SC; 6: Me-3 7 8.6) or 2,3-c& (4d, 4e; 5d, 5e: Me-3 z 9.3) dihydrobenzofurans with the ally1 groups either on oxygen (3c, 7: CH, T 5.5). carbon (4a-e: 6c: CH, z 6.     Pyrolysis of the compounds of type 1, 2 and 3, leading to expected products (Table I), confirmed the proposed structures and solved some of the stereochemical problems. Initially, since all the derived, natural and synthetic, trans-2,3dihydrobenzofurans (types %7, series a-c) give ORD curves [i(nm) of extrema: tr (3 15 _+ 7) 0 (301 + 4) pk (287 f 3) tr (267 f 3) pk 248 (+7)] of (2S,3S)-compounds [2], the absolute configuration at C-2 and 3 must be as shown in 1-7, series a-c, and only the stereochemistries of C-3a in la and lc, and of C-5 in 2b and 2c remain to be determined. The ORD curves of la and lc are different and the compounds must be epimerit at C-3a. Indeed, the PMR signals due to the CH,-groups at this chiral centre occur at significantly higher field in the spectrum of lc than of la (A 0.27 and 0 17 ppm). The ally1 group of lc must thus possess the 3aS-configuration, protruding into the relatively protected zone above the aromatic ring. In contrast, the trans-arrangement (2S,3aR-configuration) must exist between the ally1 group and the aromatic ring of burchellin (la). Since it is highly probable that 2c is the Cope rearrangement product of lc, it must show the SR-configuration. Although lb, the putative precursor of 2b, was not isolated, the (2S,3S,5R)stereochemistry can nevertheless also be assumed for 2b, due to the similarity of its ORD curve and the curve of 2c. . To our knowledge no correlations of stereochemistry and ORD curves of 2,3-cis-dihydrobenzofurans have yet been published. Thus, at this time, it can only be stated that all the natural and synthetic cis-2,3_dihydrobenzofurans (types 4, 5; series d, e), giving similar ORD curves [/Z(nm) of extrema: pK (314 f 7) 0 (295 f. lo), tr (282 ) 6), 0 (265 + 6), pk (245 + 0)], have identical absolute stereochemistry.The parent compounds, whose relative configuration is shown in Id and le, have of course not only this same stereochemistry at C-2,3, but also identical configuration A& (1 J 66,36,36,52(1) 15.12.7, 23 a carbonyl in saturated environment (v,,, 1705 cm-' ') and the PMR spectra of 9 and canellin-C were also very similar (Table 3). The significant differences concern the methoxyl which, situated on the aliphatic portion of canellin-C (z 6.72), substitutes the aryl group of 9 (z 6.20).The oxymethine proton at C-2 of 9 is thus not adjacent to a fully substituted bridgehead carbon, as in canellin C (T 5.90, s), and represented by a doublet (z 5.87). The H-8 signal continues as a singlet (canellin-C z 5.63, 9 z 540). The dihedral angle HC@)-C(5)H must, thus, measure around 82", a fact which requires the hydroxyl at C-8 to be directed towards the 5-membered ring (cf.[IS]). Since the benzylic CIJ is represented by a clean doublet, this group cannot be adjacent to C-5 and structure 9 results. The trans-arrangement of the aryl and methyl substituents is compatible with the CEI,-frequency which occurs at relatively high field (z 9.12). All prominent mass spectral peaks are easily rationalized on grounds of structure 9 (Scheme 2). Pyrolysis of the constituents (Table 1). A soln of the cmpd. in the indicated solvent under NZ was maintained at the indic. temp. for the indic. time. The cooled reaction mixture was ext. with Et,O. The Et,O-soln. was washed with 10% aq. HCI, HZ0 and d;ied. The solvent was evaporated and the residue fractionated bv TLC (conditions indic.) into products which were eluted w&h solvents and weighed. TLC%pots indicated quantitative conversion into the indic. products. The elution technique, however, resulted in losses of ca 40%. 
EXPERIMENTALand were fully consistent with the proposed structures. These were further checked by PMR double irradiation experiments involving H-3. In each of the cases studied (lc, Id, le; 2b. 2c; 4d) the doublets attributed to Me-3 and H-3 collapsed to singlets. Additionally, irradiation at the ally1 methine proton frequency of

Isolntion of the constituents. Plant material of an Aniba sp. from the Ducke Forest Reserve, Manaus, Amazonas, was deposited at INPA, Manaus, Herbaria Bot. 42237, Chem. 31/73. A description is available from the botanist W. Rodrigues. Trunk wood (5 kg) gave a C6H6 ext. (14.4 g) which was chro-matographed on a silica (300g) column, giving the following fractions with the indicated eluants: A,(C6H6), AZ (C6H6-EtOH 99.8:0.2). A, and Aa (C,H,-EtOH 995:05). A, was crystallized from MeOH -giving -sitosterol (1.58 kg).-The mother liquor was purified by TLC (SiOt, CHCl,-MeOH 95: 5) to give 2b (152 mg). AZ was fractionated by TLC (SiOZ, CHCl,-MeOH 99: 1) into 2b (35 mg), 9 (12 mg), 3c (25 mg) and lc (29mal. A, was fractionated by TLC (SiO,, Et,O) into 3c i145Gg), ic (27mg), a mixt. oi 4d + ib (37mg), ? (22 mg) and Id (59 mg). Similarly, A4 gave Id (347 mg), 2c (776 mg) and le (387 mg).
