SESQUITERPENES, TRITERPENOIDS, LIMONOIDS AND FLAVONOIDS OF CEDRELA ODORA TA GRAFT AND SPECULATIONS ON THE INDUCED RESISTANCE AGAINST HYPSIPYLA GRANDELLA
From the stem of Cedrela odorata grafted on Toona cil&ta var. austral& were isolated calamenene,  cycloeucalenol, sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, gedunin, 7-deacetylgedunin, 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin,  methylangolensate, febrifugin, azadiradione, 20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone, 3fl-deacetylfissinolide and, catechin, together with the new limonoid 1 a-methoxy-1,2-dihydrogedunin and the new cycloartane 3fl-Ofl-D-glucopyranosylcycloeucalenol. The limonoids were of little value to clarify the basis of the induced resistance in the graft against Hypsipyla grandella. The cycloartanes and catechin could have been translocated from Toona stock to the Cedrela graft.

INTRODUCTIONEfforts to establish large-scale homogeneous plantations of native Meliaceae have almost invariably failed due to larval attacks by the shoot borer Hypsipyla (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The host range of this oligophagous pantropical genus is limited principally to the Swietenioideae. Of this subfamily, important species of the genera Khaya and Entandrophragma in Africa, Swietenia and Cedrela in Latin America and Toona in Asia and Australia are attacked. However, Toona ciliata introduced to Brazil shows excellent growth and an absence of attacks by H. grandella, in contrast to the native Cedrela odorata. The latter has been grafted to stems of T. ciliata and the resistance has been translocated from the Toona stock to the Cedrela graft [1]. The natural products of these grafts have not been previously studied. Thus, we have now examined the stem of C. odorata grafted on T. ciliata var. australis, in order to determine if secondary metabolites present in the latter could be translocated into the former.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA dichloromethane-soluble fraction of the methanol extract of the stem of C. odorata graft afforded *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. the sesquiterpene calamenene [2], the cycloartane cycloeucalenol (1) [3], the sterols sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol, the limonoids gedunin (2) [4,5], 7-deacetylgedunin (3) [6], 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (4) [6], methylangolensate (5) [6], febrifugin (6) [6] and azadiradione (7) [7], the apotirucallane 20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone (8) [8], as well as the new limonoid 9.Compound 9 exhibited similar spectral data to 2 [4,5]. The ~ H NM R spectrum (Table 1), instead of signals for a ring-A 1-en-3-one, showed a signal for one methoxyl singlet (6 3.31) and ~H resonances for an ABX system associated with 2H-2 (6 2.86, J = 16.4, 4.0 and 2.65 Hz; J = 16.4 and 3.0 Hz) and H-l (6 3.34, br t, J = 3.2 Hz). The smaller coupling constant indicated that the methoxyl group was attached a to C-1. This was also supported by NOESY experiments, which showed correlations of the methoxyl signal with the signals of H-2~ (6 2.65) and H-9 (6 3.09) and of the signal of H-1 with the signal of H3-19 (6 1.12). In addition, the signal of H-7 (6 4.50) showed cross peaks with the signals of H-6fl (6 1.79), H-6a (6 1.88), H-15 (6 3.51) and H3-30 (6 1.12); this implies that the acetate is attached a to C-7, as in 2.The identification of the ring A as a 1-methoxy-3one was also supported by comparison of the IH and J3C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and2) with those of l~methoxy-l,2-dihydroepoxyazadiradione (10) [9]. *Data obtained in this study suggest that these resonances were previously incorrectly assigned.Moreover, the chemical shifts of the ring B-E carbons were comparable with those reported for 2 (Table 2) [4,5]. The new natural product was therefore identified as 1 ct-methoxy-1,2-dihydrogedunin.In order to confirm that 9 is a genuine natural product and was not derived from addition of methanol to the 1-en-3-one system, a solution of 2 in methanol with a small amount of silica gel added was stirred for three weeks at room temperature. After removal of solvent, the ~H NMR spectrum of the recovered material indicated that no reaction occurred. This observation, together with the fact that the stem examined did not give the two possible epi-mers at C-l, provided conclusive evidence that 9 is naturally occurring.The IH-IH COSY, TOCSY, HMQC and HMBC on 20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone (8) permitted minor corrections to previous IH and 13C NMR assignments [8]. The signals for H-5 and H-22 (Table 1) and C-4, C-9, C-10, C-16 and C-22 (Table 2) were reassigned.An ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the methanol extract of the stem of C. odorata graft afforded the limonoids 2, 3fl-deacetylfissinolide (11) [10], the flavonoid catechin [11] and the new cycloartane 12.Compound 12 showed the spectral characteristics of a triterpene glycoside. Acetylation of 12 with acetic anhydride in pyridine gave a tetra-acetate (12a). The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 12a and cycloeucalenol (1) [3] were very similar. The presence of a 2,3,4,6tetra-O-acetyl-fl-glucopyranose linked at C-3fl was indicated by the proton signal at 6 3.12 (dt, J = 10.5 and 4.8 Hz, H-3ct) and the 13C signal at 6 88.0 (Table 2). The configuration of the anomeric position of the glucose moiety was assigned to be fl from the coupling constant of the anomeric proton (6 4.58 d, J = 8.0Hz). The nature of the sugar was confirmed by a comparative analysis of the 13C NMR data for 12a with those of quinovic acid 3fl-O-~-D-glucopyranoside peracetyl dimethyl ester (13, a dimethyl urs-12-en-14, ! 7-dioate) [ 12]. Thus, compound 12 was concluded to be 3fl-O-fl-D-glucopyranosylcycloeucalenol.As reported previously [13], limonoid biosynthesis in Cedrela proceeds along only one route, which leads .,... to the ring-D lactone derivatives (2-5 and 9) and then to the mexicanolide group (6 and 11). Thus, C. odorata graft produces a considerable number of limonoids which are common in Cedrela, but 3, 7, 11 and the apotirucallane 8 were not previously found from the latter. Compounds 7 and 8 are typical of the Toona [13], but they might be the biosynthetic intermediates to Cedrela limonoids. Studies of the structure/anti-insect activity relationships for several limonoids have established that aside from the C-seco-limonoids, the most active compounds appear to be intact apo-euphol limonoids with a 14,15-epoxide and a 3-oxo-l-ene A ring. Absence of the 14, 15fl-epoxide results in reduced activity, as with 7 [14]. Thus, the finding of both limonoids 7 and 8 is of little value to clarify the basis of induced resistance in the graft.Stigmasterol and campesterol do not appear to have been recorded previously from C: odorata and T. ciliata. However, they are of widespread distribution and thus possibly of little chemotaxanomic interest. Representatives of the cadinene series of sesquiterpenes have been reported from the stems of C. odorata and T. ciliata [2,15], but calamenene is known only from the former. Flavonols and 3-glycoside derivatives were found in leaves ofC. sinensis [16], but not so far in any other Cedrela. Proanthocyanidins have otherwise been reported from only a single Toona species (stem of T. ciliata) [17].The genus Cedrela has been widely investigated, but, to date, there are no records of cycloartanes. Our own investigations of the stem and leaves of T. ciliata revealed the presence of cycloeucalenol (1) and 12 (unpublished results). Since the latter types and proanthocyanidins have not been found in C. odorata, the occurrence of both cycloartanes (1 and 12) and catechin (in great amounts) in the graft suggests that these constituents could have been translocated from the Toona stock to the Cedrela graft. However, both species should be re-examined for condensed tannins and their precursors (as catechin), and C. odorata for cycloartanes.
