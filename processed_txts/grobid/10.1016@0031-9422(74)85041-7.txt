OF LICARIA CANELLA"
INTRODUCTIONLicariu canella (Meissn.) Kosterm. is a tree which grows in the Amazon region. The trunk wood yielded sitosterol, dillapiol (l-allyl-2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene), elemicin (5-allyl-1,2,3_trimethoxybenzene) and three new compounds for which the names canellin-A, -B and -C are proposed.The oxygen functions of canellin-A, C1 ,H180h, were easily assigned by PMR spectrometry, warranting expansion of the formula to C1 sH1 8. 20H. 20Me. 02CHz. The C, ,-skeleton is of the guianin (1) type;2 thus, the MS contains a prominent m/e 162 peak attributable to 2 (Scheme), since PMR evidence accounts for all protons in the C,2H,,,02 unit of the partial structure 3. In contrast to guianin, however, here both undefined centres are fully substituted. The cc-proton (T 6.75, d, J 9.0 Hz) is coupled to one vicinal hydrogen, and the /?-proton (signal analyzable in the NMR of dihydrocanellin-A: T 7.63, apparent quintuplet, J apparently 2: 8 Hz, in reality J 7.0 and 9.0 Hz) is coupled to four hydrogens.Both hydroxyls have secondary alcohol functions, since two of the oxymethine proton signals suffer 1 ppm paramagnetic shifts on acetylation. One of these protons is represented by a singlet (z 6.49) and the respective CHOH group must, consequently, be located * Part 26 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae". between two quaternary carbons. The other proton is represented by a doublet (z 5.97) whose coupling constant (J 6.5 Hz) reveals its axialkxial interaction H ith a neighbouring proton. This could. u pr.io~i, belong tither to the CHOMe or to the CH2 units. The oxymethine hydrogen, however. is represented by a triplet (r 6.38, .I 6-5 Hz) and is thus subject to two axial interactions, while the axial methylene hydrogen is represented by a doublet (T 8.46, J 15.8 and 6.5 Hz) and thus vicinal to only one axial proton. This karbon system must, consequently, be formulated as shown in 3, a sequence which agrees with the obscrvation that only the CHOMe signal (A -0.3 ppm). but not the CH, signals. is shifted on acetylation. Both the remaining methoxyl and ally1 groups. must be attached to non-protonated carbons. The PMR spectrum contains only the ether methine proton signal assigned above. and the allylic methylcnc protons (r 7.50 7.62. m: 1; 7.95. c/r/. .I 9.2 and 13.5 Hz) are nonequivalent and coupled only to each other and the adjacent olcfinic hydrogen.
I--The units of partial structure 3 can be assembled in four ways (4a. b: 5a. b). The nllylbenzenes, which arc presumed biogenetic precursors of canellin-A. arc uniformly oxygenated at the ptrrw-position so that the pair of alternatives 4b and 51 are hiphly improbable. By contrast. the biosyntheses of 4a and Sb involve reasonable metabolitrs. such as 6a or 7a. derived by oxidation of an clemicin precursor, or 6b or 7b. derived by oxidation of a dillapiol precursor. Radicals of type 6 are certainly formed in Lauraceae. as documented in the structures ofguinnan (1 ).' porosin (8)" and burchellin (9).5 In addition. since I7lrr.a~sub-stitution is favoured over ortho-substitution,5 canellin-A is probably formed by coupling of 6a or b with a radical derived from isoeugenol'j leading to 10 or 11, both of which would yield 4a, rather than 5b.The MS fragmentation (Scheme), is, of course, consistent with either alternative. A tentative decision in favour of 4a, with the relative stereochemistry 13a, was reached by the following set of experiments. Treatment of canellin-A with the Jones reagent led to a mixture of ketones with carbonyls in 5-(v,,, 1745 cm-') and 6-(v,,, 1720 cm-') membered cycles. Since oxidation of dihydrocanellin-A failed to give a pure product, a partially protected substrate was prepared. Selective acetylation of canellin-A at the C-4 hydroxyl, diagnosed by the shift of the carbinolic proton doublet (A -1.04 ppm), led to a monoacetate. This was oxidized to give a pure ketone (12) which, as well as its hydrolysis product, has the carbonyl in a five-membered ring (v,,,1760cm-'). Oxidation of dihydrocanellin-A monoacetate also afforded a pure ketone (dihydro-12, v,,,,,1750 cm-'). The acetate carbonyls of the mono-and di-acetates show bands at lower frequency (1735 cm-'). Transformation of the secondary alcohol at C-8 into a carbonyl (dihydro-13b-+ dihydro-12) was accompanied by two PMR phenomena. Thus, there are diamagnetic shifts of the ArH (A H-2' 0.54, H-5' 0.25, H-6' 0.23 ppm) and the H-7 (A 0.50 ppm) signals, which contrasts with the virtual constancy of the H-6 (A -0.05 ppm) and Me-7 (A -0.04 ppm) signals. The exo-endo arrangement, which thus becomes obvious for the aryl-methyl substituents, imposes the tram configuration on the 6,7-bond, a fact which is consistent with the relatively large coupling J6,7 9.0 Hz [porosin (8) burchellin (9) and guianin (l), admittedly imperfect analogies, J resp. 5.4, 9.5 and 7.0 Hz] and the normal chemical shift of the Me-7 protons (r 9.13). The cis configuration would place these protons into the positively shielded region above the aromatic plane [see porosin (8) T 9.483. The second PMR feature is the large paramagnetic shift of the high field (A 0.10 ppm). which contrasts with the low field (A 0.02 ppm) methoxy signal. The former signal must thus be correlated with the bridgehead methoxyl situated in the plane of the introduced carbonyl. The high field but not the low field signal is sensitive to change of solvent. Thus, on changing from CDCl, to Ccl, solutions of canellin-A and its derivatives this signal is shifted to even higher field (4a: A 0.14 ppm, dihydro-13b:A 0.06 ppm). Formation of a D-bridge between the basic aryl group and the solvent molecule is possible, evidently. only in CDC'l,.-The fact that the heightened magnetic anisotropy of the aryl group in Ccl, produces additional shielding of methoxyl is taken as an indication that thcsc groups are vicinal and excludes structure Sh as a vlablc alternative. The equatorial conformation of the acetoxyl is consistent ~+ith the relative resistance of 7 to hydrolysis \vhich requires hot _"'~,) aq. NaOH. The PMR spectrum of the resulting alcohol showed, besides the expected changes, the carbinolic proton signal with an unexpectedly small J (W 2 Hz) and the OMe-5 signal at an unexpectedly high field (~7.20). These facts probably reflect a retroaldol-aldol equilibrium.The consequent inversion at C-4 pushes the H-4 into the equatorial position (hence diminishing Jl,_ 3 f, s ) and the methoxyl over the aryl group (hence increasing ~~~~~~ Finally. acet>lation of t6c hydroxyl at C-8 shifts the H-7 signal (A --0.X ppm), but leaves the signals due to the protons of the e-membered ring unaltered. Its orientation towards the Smembered ring is. consequently, indicated. Only in this configuration would it bc able to contribute towards the molecular asymmetry caused 1~1 the ar}I group and portrayed by the slight non-equivalence of the methylenedioxy protons (AB system. r 4.1 1 and 4.13). This non-equivalence would be expcctcd to be enhanced through xubstitution of the C-X carbinol by a cnrbonyl and this is indeed the case (AB s!'stem. 7 4.19 and 3.11). 
J (Hz)Mult.  The bisarylpropanoid nature of canellin-B was inferred by the formula C21H,,0,, determined by high resolution MS, and expanded to C, nH, ,,02 . O,CH, .20Me after inspection of the PMR spectrum. This showed additionally that canellin-B (~,,,I660 cm-') is of the porosin (v,,,1667 cm-', 8)3 type (Table 1). With the exception that the two aromatic methoxy signal in porosin are replaced by a 02CH, signal, and that its H-4 singlet is replaced by a signal due to an enolic methoxyl, all spectral features are duplicated, and must, consequently be interpreted in an analogous manner, leading to structure 14 for canellin-B. In contrast to the situation in porosin where the multiplicity of the pertinent PMR signals indicate the relative locations of the functions on the aliphatic 6-membered ring, in the case of canellin-B structure 15 has to be considered as a valid, albeit less probable, alternative. The stereochemistry of the 2,3-bond constitutes an additional difference between the two neolignans. Clearly cis in porosin (JH_-2,H_3 5.4 Hz), where the Me group (z 9.48) falls into the shielded region above the aryl group, it is truns in canellin-B (JiI_-2,H_-3 10.0 Hz, tMe 8.96). The MS is compatible with the proposed structures, revealing the expected facile loss of an ally1 radical ([M-C,H,]+ lOOoi,, [M-C,H,-CO]+ 847;) and cleavage of the heterocycle ([CH202C,H3CH=CHMe]+ 90%). Canellin-C, C20H240h, is also a bisarylpropanoid, since functional analysis establishes the partial structure C1 (lH 1 70. 20H. OMe. O,CH,. The undefined oxygen in this formula, however, is not part of an ether, but of a carbonyl function in saturated environment (v,,,,,1720cm-'), and thus the compound could be a structural analogue of canellin-A (4a), rather than of canellin-B (14 or 15). Indeed, comparison of the PMR spectra (Table 2) clearly favours this. The significant difference reveals replacement of the methoxymethine at position 4 in canellin-A (4a) by the carbonyl in canellin-C. This fact rationalizes the appearance of the C-4 oxymethine signal as a singlet and of the C-2 methylene signals at lower field. Alternatives to structure 16a, which thus is tentatively proposed for canellin-C, could not be disproved, due to lack of material.
J (Hz)The relationship between canellins A and C extends to their stereochemistry. While the hydroxyl at C-8 of guianin (1)2 is acetylated with ease, only the 4-0-acetyl derivatives (13b, 16b) result upon treatment of the two canellins with AclO:C,,H,N at room temp. Attack of the hydroxyl at C-S seems to be hindered by the proximity of the aryl group, the exe-attachment of this group being evident, additionally, by the non-equivalence of the methylenedioxy protons. The benzylic hydrogens at C-6 are thus in& oriented in the canellins A and C, the diamagnetic shift of the respective signal upon passing from A to C being due to shielding by the carbonyl of the latter cmpd.

,Acetylation of the hydroxyl at C-4 leaves the ArH and H-7 signals unaffected. but causes significant shifts of the H-6 (A -0.40 ppm) and H-3 (A -1.00 ppm) signals. The modified group must thus occupy the ~~I&~ face of the molecule and. since the proton at C-4 is axial. as shown by its axial axial interaction (.J 6.5 Hz) with the ncighbouring H-3, the h-membercd ring occurs in the chair conformation.
