Piperamides and their derivatives as potential anti-trypanosomal agents
We describe herein an evaluation of the trypanocidal effect of eight piperamides (1-8) isolated from Piper tuberculatum bearing dihydropyridone, piperidine, and isobutyl moieties against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease. Based on such results, three hydrogenated and two hydrolyzed derivatives (10-14) were prepared and evaluated as well. The dihydropyridone amides (1-3) displayed higher anti-trypanosomal activity. The (Z)piplartine (1) showed higher activity with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC 50 ) value of 10.5 lM, almost four times more potent than the positive control, benznidazole (IC 50 = 42.7 lM), and should be further evaluated as a suitable hit for the design of new antiprotozoal agents.

IntroductionDiscovery and development of new drugs from natural sources is not a new phenomenon. Natural products have long been used as templates for the design of new lead compounds which may be useful against infectious diseases, such as blactams, tetracyclins, echinocandins, and macrolydes (Newman and Cragg, 2007). In this context, several metabolites of different structural patterns have proven active against microorganisms, and screening of extracts is a valid strategy being exploited to discover novel antimicrobial agents (Acharya et al., 2008;Singh et al., 2008;Tripathi et al., 2004;Viswanathan et al., 2004;Wang et al., 2007).Chagas' disease (or American trypanosomiasis) is caused by the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and affects an estimated 16-18 million people. About 30-40% of infected patients develop chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, which represents a major public health problem concern in Latin America (Dias et al., 2002). Current chemotherapy for this disease involves two drugs, nitrofurans (nifurtimox) or nitroimidazoles (benznidazole), which are efficient only during the acute and short-term chronic phase. Unfortunately, the usefulness of these drugs is limited by their narrow therapeutic windows, strong side-effects, and variable susceptibilities among T. cruzi strains, resulting in low clinical efficacies. Efforts are thus urgently necessary to identify, design, and develop new anti-chagasic drug candidates (Castro et al., 2006).As part of our ongoing screening program for new anti-trypanosomal compounds in Brazilian Piper species, we have previously reported the occurrence of chromenes in P. aduncum and P. gaudichaudianum (Batista-Ju ´nior et al., 2008). Additionally, hydroquinones and flavanones from leaves of P. crassinervium have been described (Lopes et al., 2008). In this context, we found that the crude extracts obtained from seeds and leaves of P. tuberculatum Jacq. (Piperaceae) showed remarkable proliferation inhibition of T. cruzi, showing a high activity, with IC 50 values of 25.0 and 46.0 lg/ml, respectively.Therefore, the main aim of this work was to evaluate the trypanocidal activity of natural piperamides and piperamides derivatives in the search for new potential hits for Chagas' disease treatment, as well as to investigate preliminary structureactivity relationship for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi effects exhibited.
Materials and methods
GeneralAll reagents were of analytical grade. The structures of all natural compounds (1-9) and the semisynthetic derivatives (10-14) were confirmed by 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 13 C-NMR spectral data and were compared with those described in literature. NMR experiments were recorded by Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz ( 1 H) and 125 MHz ( 13 C) using the solvents as an internal standard. Benznidazole was purchased from Roche (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).
Plant materialThe plant material was collected in September of 2005 from a specimen of P. tuberculatum growing under greenhouse conditions at the Institute of Chemistry (UNESP, Araraquara-SP, Brazil), and was identified by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru). The voucher specimen (Kato-163) was deposited at the Herbarium of the Institute of Biosciences, USP, Sa ˜o Paulo-SP, Brazil.
Extraction and isolation of compounds 1-9Shade-dried and powdered leaves (147.0 g) and seeds (22.0 g) of P. tuberculatum were extracted with ethyl acetate:methanol (2:1) during 2 weeks at room temperature. The crude extracts from leaves (3.6 g) and seeds (1.2 g) were fractionated on silica-gel chromatographic column followed by preparative thinlayer chromatography (TLC) as previously described (Navickiene et al., 2000;Silva et al., 2002), and resulted in the isolation of seven piperamides from seeds, namely (Z)-piplartine (7.0 mg, 1) (Silva et al., 2002), (E)-piplartine (45 mg, 2) (Duh et al., 1990), 8,9-dihydropiplartine (19.0 mg, 3) (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991), piperine (46.0 mg, 4) (Arau ´jo-Junior et al., 1997), 10,11-dihydropiperine (22.0 mg, 5) (Bernard et al., 1995;Parmar et al., 1997), 5,6-dihydropiperlonguminine (45 mg, 6) (Bernard et al., 1995;Parmar et al., 1997), and pellitorine (88 mg, 8) (Rosario et al., 1996). Further phytochemical studies carried out on leaves of P. tuberculatum afforded two compounds, fagaramide (35.0 mg, 7) (Isao, 1984) and methyl (E)-6,7,8-trimethoxycinnamate (42.0 mg, 9) (Settimj et al., 1976).
Preparation of derivatives 10-14Piperamide derivatives 10-14 were prepared according to modified procedures described in literature (Nozoe et al., 2001;Ribeiro et al., 2004).An aliquot of 10 mg natural piperamides 3, 5, and 8 was dissolved in 20 ml chloroform containing 50 mg activated charcoal (10% Pd). Then, the reaction mixture was maintained stirring overnight at atmospheric H 2 pressure. After usual work-up the crude product was fractionated by preparative TLC using hexane:dichloromethane:acetone (3:1:1) yielding tetrahydropiplartine (10) (77%) (Joshi et al., 1968), tetrahydropiperine (11) (81%) (Madhusudhan and Vandana, 2001), and tetrahydropellitorine (12) (83 %) (Molina-Torres et al., 2004).For alkaline hydrolysis, 4 (25 mg) and 9 (30 mg) were dissolved in 3 ml alcoholic potassium hydroxide (20 %), and then stirred at 90°C for 48 h. The ethanol solution was concentrated to dryness, and resulting solid was dispersed in water acidified with HCl (pH 2.0), filtrated, and washed with water. Finally, the solid was purified by recrystalization in ethanol to yield piperic acid (13) (88%) (Mishra et al., 2005) and (E)-6,7,8-trimethoxycinnamic acid (14) (75 %) (Lebedev et al., 2005).The molecular structure of natural compounds (1-9) and their semisynthetic derivatives (10-14) are showed in Fig. 1.
Trypanocidal activity in vitroAll experiments were performed with the Y-strain epimastigote forms of T. cruzi. They were grown axenically at 28°C in liver-infusion Tryptose (LIT) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and harvested during exponential phase of growth (7-day-old culture forms). Compounds 1-14 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and further added to a 96-well tissue culture plate (TPP) in different final concentrations. T. cruzi (1 9 10 7 parasites/ml) were added to each well and the same quantity of LIT medium was added into the controls wells. These plates were maintained at 28°C for 72 h. Thus, an aliquot of 10 lL 2.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide-phenazinemethosulfate (MTT-PMS) solution was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 75 min in the dark at 28°C. A solution of 10% (100 lL) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added to the anterior solution and maintained at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Absorbance of the samples was read at 595 nm. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values were determined by linear regression analysis after a 72-h incubation period. The IC 50 values of compounds 1-14 and benznidazole (positive control) were determined. For the statistical analysis, probit's method was employed (Muelas-Serrano et al., 2000). 
Results and discussionPiperamides are among the secondary metabolites of interest since many of these compounds display a broad range of biological activities. Kapil reported an investigation of piperine (4) activity against promastigote forms of Leishmania donovani (Kapil, 1993). More recently, Ribeiro described the highly significant antitrypanosomal activity of piperine and its toxic effects on epimastigote forms of T. cruzi (Freire-de-Lima et al., 2008;Ribeiro et al., 2004). Raay et al. (1999) related in vivo testing in hamsters infected with L. donovani with piperine incorporated into liposomes. Piperlongumine (2) displayed in vitro and in vivo activities towards amastigotes of L. donovani, antiproliferative effect against tumor-cell lineages, and in vivo growth inhibition of Sarcoma 180 (Bezerra et al., 2006;Bodiwala et al., 2007). To pellitorine ( 8), an antibacterial activity has been attributed and it is known to be effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Reddy et al., 2004;Rukachaisirikul et al., 2004).The natural piperamides bearing dihydropyridone (1-3), piperidine (4-5), and isobutyl (6-8) moieties as well as methyl (E)-6,7,8-trimethoxycinnamate ( 9) isolated from P. tuberculatum were evaluated against epimastigote forms of T. cruzi (Table 1). These results encouraged us to prepare a series of derivatives (10-14) in order to determine the chemical features responsible for the anti-trypanosomal activity observed.Dihydropyridone amides (1-3) showed a concentration-dependent trypanocidal effect with IC 50 values (lM) ranging from 10.5 to 30.0. Both geometric isomers of piplartine (1 and 2) displayed potent activity when compared with the positive control, benznidazole (IC 50 = 42.7 lM). The (Z)-piplartine (1) was twice as active as its isomer E (2, IC 50 = 21.0 lM) and four times as active as benznidazole, evidencing a key role of configuration pattern in the antiprotozoal activity observed.  The hydrogenated derivatives (10-12) were also assayed and allowed some insights. Reduction of the double bonds of the piplartines interferes with the antiparasitic activity, suggesting that conjugations are critical for trypanocidal activity. It is noteworthy that derivatives of piplartine lacking either one or both double bonds were seen to be less active. 8,9-Dihydropiplartine (3, IC 50 = 30.0 lM), lacking one double bond, was slightly less active than piplartines 1 and 2, whereas tetrahydropiplartine (10, IC 50 [ 250.0 lM), lacking both double bonds, was seen to be even less active than 3. Results are summarized in Table 1.Recently, the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety has already been implicated in the biological activity of other natural products such as cytostatin and fostriecin. This behavior is most probably due to its susceptibility to 1,4-addition nucleophilic (Michael's acceptor) by attachment from amino-acid residues (e.g., cysteine, lysine, serine or threonine) present in the biological receptors, which interact with these compounds via Michael's addition (Bialy and Waldmann, 2003;Buck et al., 2003). Furthermore, it has been possible to recognize a Michael's acceptor on the molecular structure of the piplartines (1-3), which is presented as an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl at dihydropyridone ring (C-2/C-3/C-4) (Fig. 2).Similar to piplartines, the reduction of the double bonds of the piperine (as in compounds 5 and 11) gave rise to a significant decrease in toxicity, indicating their essential role in trypanocidal activity. Finally, these findings suggest that double bonds conjugated with a carbonyl group are critical for the highest anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity. Fagaramide (7) and its analogue, 5,6-dihydropiperlonguminine (6), with a fivecarbon extended side-chain were also shown to be inactive against T. cruzi at the concentration tested (IC 50 [ 250.0 lM). On the other hand, ester 9 and acid compounds 13 and 14 did not show any activity at the maximum concentration tested (IC 50 [ 250.0 lM), which is evidence that a nitrogen-containing functional group is required for significant anti-trypanosomal activity.Pellitorine (8, IC 50 = 57.1 lM) showed similar activity when compared with benznidazole and piperine (4, IC 50 = 233.0 lM), which suggests that exchange of the piperidine moiety of the a,b,c,d-unsaturated amides (3) for the isobutyl group enhanced potency. To confirm the requirement for the a,b,c,d-unsaturated carbonyl Fig. 2 Hypothetical pharmacophores of (Z)-piplartine (1) identified by their trypanocidal activity against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi system for anti-trypanosomal activity, piperamide 8 was subjected to hydrogenation, furnishing tetrahydropellitorine (12), an alkylamide, which was not active (IC 50 [ 250.0 lM).In conclusion, we have isolated a series of piperamides (1-3 and 8) from P. tuberculatum seeds, which potential inhibit proliferation of T. cruzi parasites and may be considered suitable as template compounds for the design of novel and more potent hit compounds for the treatment of Chagas' disease.Fig. 11Fig. 1 Chemical structures of compounds 1-9 isolated from Piper tuberculatum and derivatives 10-14
