NEW ALKALOIDS FROM CONCHOCARPUS GAUDICHAUDIANUS
The methanol extract from stems of Conchocarpus gaudichaudianus yielded four new alkaloids: 3-(2- (7,7-dimethyl-3,7-dihydropyrano[3,2-e]indol-1yl)ethyl)quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (1), 3-(2-(7,7-dimethyl-3,7-dihydropyrano-[3,2-e]indol-1-yl)ethyl)-1-hydroxyquinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (2), 3-(2-(7,7dimethyl-3,7-dihydropyrano[3,2-e]indol-1-yl)ethyl-1-methylquinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (3), (E)-3-(6,7-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyloct-2-enyl)-4-methoxy-1methylquinolin-2(1H)-one (6), in addition to the known alkaloids N-transcoumaroyltyramine and N-trans-feruloyltyramine. The structures of these compounds were identified by IR, UV, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, gHSQC and gHMBC spectral analysis and comparison of data from the literature.Conchocarpus gaudichaudianus, a tree, is used by the aboriginal natives in northern Brazil. 1 Of the 45 species in the genus Conchocarpus, only C. heterophyllus, C. inopinatus and C. paniculata have been investigated by spectroscopic analysis. Extracts from leaves of C. heterophyllus and the dichloromethane fraction of C. inopinatus show in vitro trypanocidal activity 2,3 and C. paniculata exhibits molluscicidal activity. 4Indolopyridoquinazoline type alkaloids, like rutaecarpine isolated from Evodia rutaecarpa, shows a variety of pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory 5 antithrombotic and vasorelaxant effects. 6 We report studies on the stems of C. gaudichaudianus, which afforded three new indoloquinazolone alkaloids (1, 2 and 3) and one 2-quinolone alkaloid (6).

The methanol extract from stems of Conchocarpus gaudichaudianus yielded six alkaloids 1 -6, including the known N-trans-coumaroyltyramine (4) and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (5).
Figur e 1. Compounds from Conchocarpus gaudichaudianusThe molecular formula of compound (1) was established to be C 23 H 21 N 3 O 3 by analysis of its HR-MS (ESI) [m/z: 410.1519 (M+Na) + ] and NMR data (Table 1). IR spectrum showed absorption of a tertiary amide function at 1660 cm -1 . The UV results (see Experimental) were also in agreement with a highly aromatic conjugation system. The 1 H NMR spectrum (300 MHz) of 1 showed two symmetrical triplets at δ 4.13 and δ 3.02, corresponding to protons H-7 and H-8, an NH indolic group at δ 10.44, and six aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.56 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, H-11); 7.08 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, H-12) and at δ 7.19 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, H-1); 7.65 (td, J = 8.1 and 1.3 Hz, H-2); 7.21 (t, J = 8.1 Hz, H-3); 7.95 (dd, J = 8.1 and 1.3 Hz, H-4). The presence of a 2,2-dimethylchromene ring was evidenced by a methyl singlet at δ 1.35 integrating for six hydrogens and two doublets H-9' and H-10' at δ 5.72 (d, J = 9.8 Hz, H-10') and 7.28 (d, J = 9.8 Hz, H-9').Full assignments of the hydrogens and protonated carbons of alkaloid 1 were attained by 1 H-1 H gCOSY and 1 H-13 C heteronuclear correlated 2D NMR spectra (gHMQC). Also, by a hydrogen detected multiple bond 1 H-13 C correlation spectrum (gHMBC) all of the quaternary carbon signals were assigned (Table 1).Based on the above data and by comparison with data from goshuyuamide-II 8 (3a) structure 1 was Compound (2) was obtained as a yellow oil. The UV spectrum of 2 showed it to be related to 1. In the IR spectrum, the absorption at 3397 cm -1 indicated the presence of a hydroxyl group. Evidence for a hydroxyl at N-14 was given by the mass spectrum, which exhibited a fragment at m/z 226 [m/z 404-178(C 15 H 16 NO)] and 179 [m/z 404-225(C 8 H 7 N 2 O 3 )] and by correlation for a HN-13 at δ10. -dimethyl-3,7-dihydropyrano[3,2-e]indol- 1-yl)ethyl) -1-methylquinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione.The known N-trans-coumaroyltyramine (4) and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (5) were also isolated and identified by 1 H and 13 C NMR, mass spectrometry, and comparison of published spectral data. 9,10,11 Compound 6 was obtained as an amorphous yellow solid. The [α] D 0° obtained indicated that this compound is a raceme mixture. Its UV and IR spectra showed the characteristic absorption of a 2-quinolones. 9 The ESI-MSMS mass spectrum indicated the [M+H] + at m/z 360 (base peak), and the characteristic fragment ion of the 4-methoxy-1-methyl-2-quinolone alkaloids the [M+H] + at m/z 203. 12 The 1 H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two signals at δ 3.94 s and 3.69 s due to methoxyl and N-methyl groups (Table 2), four aromatics at δ 7.84, (dd, J=7.8 and 1.5 Hz), 7.27, (td, J=7.8 and 0.9 Hz), 7.55, (td, J=7.8 and 1.5 Hz) and 7.38, (dd, J=7.8 and 0.9 Hz). There were two methyl singlets at δ 1.07, thus placing an isopropyl group at the end of the side chain, and one signal at δ 1.80, br s, H-10'. The observed signals for a hydroxyl-tertiary carbon at δ 72.8 and three methyl singlets at δ H 1.07 (s, 6H), 1.80 (brs, 3H), a signal at δ 5.30 (td, J=6.6 and 1.1 Hz), 3.37 (d, J=6.6 Hz), in the 13 C (Table 2) and 1 H NMR, and complete assignment of chemical shifts for all carbons, confirmed the presence of a 3',7'-dimethyl-6',7'dihydroxy-2'-octenyl chain. Using the prenylquinoline alkaloid 11 as a model, the structure of this new alkaloid was established as (E)-3-(6,7-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyloct-2-enyl)-4methoxy-1-methylquinolin-2(1H)-one.
