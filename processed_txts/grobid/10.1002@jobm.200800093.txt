Endophytic fungi found in association with Smallanthus sonchifolius (Asteraceae) as resourceful producers of cytotoxic bioactive natural products
Smallanthus sonchifolius is a traditional Andean plant which has been cultured mainly in Brazil, Japan and New Zealand due to its medicinal properties. A study of the endophytic fungi associated to the plant was carried out in order to characterize new cytotoxic agents. Thirty two fungal strains were isolated and submitted to cultivation and extraction producing 186 extracts. Of these, 12% displayed moderate to high cytotoxic activities and were considered promising anticancer compound sources. The ethyl acetate fractions of Nigrospora sphaerica and Phoma betae liquid fermentations contained the synergistic compounds 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3methylisocoumarin and (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8( 14),22-tetraen-3-one which are potential compounds for drug discovery. Another isolated compound, pimara-7,15-dien-3-β-ol diterpene is being characterized for the first time through a detailed spectroscopic analysis including GC/MS, homo-and hetero-nuclear correlated NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOEdiff) along with its optical rotation.

Introduction *The Asteraceae Smallanthus sonchifolius (Poepp. and Endl.) H. Robinson, a commonly employed Andean-originated medicinal plant, has antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. Some unique substances like the antimicrobial melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones [1 -3] are present in the plant. Its tuberous roots, rich in enzymes and fructose derivatives (FOS, GF 2 -9), but deficient in starch, are indicated and consumed as healthy diet foods and prebiotics, specially in South America, New Zealand and Japan [4 -7]. The plant is also a special and unusual biological niche for fungal colonization.Interactions involving plants and fungi are quite complex. They may have qualitatively different relationships with a single host plant, from parasitism to mutualism, and/or interact with other fungi inside the same plant. As mutualists, endophytic fungi are considered innocuous to the host plant. They live in a reciprocally balanced stable state that disadvantages none of the partners, including the absence of external manifestation of diseases in the host [8]. Associated fungi may produce substances with specific functions inside and outside the host plant in which they normally reside. Thus, several bioactive natural products have been isolated from endophytic fungi showing a range of effects, for instance antimicrobial and anticancer [9].As part of the bioprospecting program in endophytic fungi associated to therapeutic Asteraceae [10 -13], it was considered that S. sonchifolius, commonly named Yacon, could host endophytic fungi able to produce bioactive secondary metabolites for pharmaceutical and biotechnological purposes. Using this approach, 32 endophytes have been isolated and characterized yielding several cytotoxic extracts and compounds. Some of the compounds isolated in this research are being reported for the first time as secondary metabolites produced by the studied fungi. The relevance of the cytotoxic outcome in the fungi and host plant associations is discussed.
Materials and methods
Isolation, identification and preservation of fungal strainsYacon leaves, roots and stems were collected in February 2006, in the city of Ribeirão Preto (S 21°11.933′ NO 47°46.699′), State of São Paulo, Brazil. A voucher specimen was deposited at the herbarium of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities of Ribeirão Preto campus, University of São Paulo (FFCLRP-USP) Ribeirão Preto, Brazil.The collected plant material was washed with running tap water and dried with absorbent paper. Surface sterilization procedures for epiphytic microbes were carried out by sequentially submerging the plant material in 70% aqueous ethanol (2.5 min), 2.5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (30, 60 or 90 min), 70% aqueous ethanol (1 min) and sterile distilled water (1 min). The borders of the sterilized segments were discarded and four tiny pieces each about 5 mm in length were excised with a sterilized scalpel from the remaining plant tissue. The excised pieces from each tissue type were plated on triplicate Petri dishes containing PDA medium supplemented with pentabiotic (100 μg/ml) and incubated initially at 30 °C for 48 h, followed by 72 h at 23 °C. The effectiveness of the sterilization procedure was verified by plating aliquots of the final water rinse on the same medium used for the endophyte cultures. Each grown fungus from plant tissues was repeatedly subcultured on PDA antibiotic-free medium until pure cultures were obtained.Conidia producing strains were identified at the Department of Mycology, Center of Biological Sciences of the Federal University of Pernambuco, PE, Brazil. Sporulating fungi were stored at 10 °C in tubes containing silica gel (6 to 12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated). The isolates, deposited at the Laboratory of Industrial Enzymology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo (FCFRP-USP), have been maintained by serial transfers onto PDA slants at 4 °C.
Cultivation and extraction proceduresTwo culture media, Czapek and rice, were selected for cultivation and screening of biological activities of the isolated fungi, respectively, in liquid and solid cultures.Liquid cultures were conducted in two steps (Fig. 1). First, the silica or slant stored fungi were inoculated onto PDA-containing medium in Petri dishes and incubated at 30 °C for 7 d. After this period, aqueous suspensions obtained either with fungal conidia or mycelia were transferred to 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of seed medium [14] and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h in a rotatory shaker (120 rpm). As a second step, this resulting pre-culture was filtered on a Büchner filter through gauze or filter paper and the obtained mycelia was transferred to a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask containing 400 ml of Czapek medium [15] and incubated at the same pre-culture conditions for 20 d. This procedure was carried out for a small scale extract production for bioprospection. Fifteen Erlenmeyer flasks were used for a large scale extract production, aiming to isolate secondary metabolites. Fungi in the 20 day cultures were killed by addition of 50 ml of methanol (MeOH), the suspension was vacuum-filtered and the filtrate fractionated by liquid-liquid partition with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The resulting organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to produce the ethyl acetate fraction of liquid cultures (EaL) and a residue (RL), which was lyophilized. The mycelial mass collected from the filter was soaked overnight in EtOH, followed by filtration and solvent evaporation to pro- duce the mycelial ethanolic extract (EtM). An Erlenmeyer flask containing seed medium without inoculum was submitted to the same preculture conditions. The resulting solid filtrate was transferred to Czapek medium and treated in the same way for control purposes.For the solid culture (Fig. 1) 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 90 g of parboiled rice in 90 ml distilled water per flask, previously twice autoclaved at 120 °C for 40 min, were employed. For a small scale preparation, one flask sufficed, but thirty flasks were needed for large scale extract preparations. Agar plugs (about 2 × 2 cm) cut from the 7 day-old original cultures on PDA agar were used for inoculation. One flask, without inoculum, was kept for control use. After 20 days incubation in a BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) device at 30 °C, EtOH was added to each flask and the contents were allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The EtOH was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure yielding the ethanol extract (EtS), which was submitted to the previously described liquid-liquid partition affording the ethyl acetate fraction (EaS) and the residual fraction (RS).
Isolation of compoundsEaS fraction (20.2 g) of Nigrospora sphaerica was fractionated by chromatography over a XAD-4 column (22.0 × 4.5 cm) using water, MeOH and EtOAc as eluents (step A, Fig. 2). Fraction M2EaS (9.9 g) was fractionated over silica gel column (CC, 230 -80 mesh, 26.0 × 4.5 cm) using a gradient from with hexane : EtOAc (95 : 5) to MeOH (100%; step B) to provide 22 fractions. Fraction 13 (30.1 mg) was identified as compound 1. Fraction M1EaS (3.1 g) was crystallized from a heated solution of MeOH/H 2 O 9 : 1 yielding compound 3 (101.0 mg; Fig. 2). Fraction EEaS (1.64 g) chromatographed over silica gel (400 -200 mesh, 25.5 × 5.0 cm) and eluted with the same gradient as above mentioned (step C) produced 9 fractions. Fraction 5 (246.6 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel (CC, 230 -80 mesh, 28.0 × 3.0 cm) and using a gradient from hexane : EtOAc (95 : 5) to EtOH (100%; step D) to yield 9 fractions. Fraction 6 (46.3 mg) was rechromatographed again on silica gel (CC, 230 -80 mesh, 20.0 × 1.3 cm) using the same gradient elution (step E) to yield compound 2 (16.9 mg).N. sphaerica fraction EaL (474.3 mg) was fractionated over silica gel (CC, 400 -200 mesh, 24.0 × 3.5 cm) by elution with gradient hexane : EtOAc (95 : 5) to EtOH (100%) (step F) yielding 7 fractions. Fraction 7 crystallized spontaneously to afford compound 3 (98.0 mg).Fraction EaS (16.5 g) originated from 20 day cultures of Phoma betae (19 flasks) was chromatographed over silica gel (400 -200 mesh, 11.0 × 12.0 cm) under gradient elution from hexane : EtOAc (9 : 1) to MeOH (100%; step G; Fig. 3) to afford 9 fractions. Fraction 5 (686.7 mg) was rechromatographed over silica gel (CC, 230 -80 mesh, 25.0 × 4.0 cm) by using gradient elution from hexane : EtOAc (8 : 2) to MeOH (100%; step H) to afford 12 fractions. Compound 2 (14.7 mg) was precipitated from fraction 5 (99.7 mg) using CHCl 3 (step I).Fraction EaS (888.2 mg) originated from 32 day cultures of P. betae (1 flask, fungus sporulation time) was chromatographed over silica gel (400 -200 mesh, 27.0 × 3.0 cm) using gradient elution with hexane : EtOAc (9 : 1) to MeOH (100%; step J, Fig. 3) to provide 13 fractions (Pb-1 to 13). Fraction 4 (Pb-4, 21.9 mg) was submitted to HPLC using an isocratic solvent system containing hexane : EtOAc (9 : 1) delivered to the a semiprep Nucleosil 100 -7 column (250 × 10 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min -1 , and monitored at 254 nm detection wavelength at 25 °C (step K). Compound 4 (12.1 mg) was collected at 41 min. The residual fraction (5.0 mg) collected at 45 min was resubmitted to HPLC employing a prep C18 Shimadzu column (250 × 20 mm I.D.) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min -1 , using MeOH as eluent, and monitored at 254 nm (step L). Compound 5 (0.6 mg) was collected at 28 min. Fraction 13 (Pb-13, 426.8 mg) was chromatographed over sephadex LH-20 column (60.0 × 2.5 cm) using EtOH as eluent (step M) to afford 7 fractions. Fraction 4 crystallized spontaneously to yield compound 6 (18.8 mg; step N). 
Spectroscopic data of compound 1
Tumor cell cultures and cytotoxic bioassayHuman tumor cell lines MDA-MB435 (breast), HCT-8 (colon), SF295 (brain) and HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia) were obtained from National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 atmosphere. The cytotoxic effect was assessed using the MTT-dye reduction assay for cell viability described by Mosmann [16] according to an established protocol [17]. Briefly, tumor cells were placed in 96-well plates at the following densities: 0.7 × 10 5 (HCT-8), 0.6 × 10 5 (SF295), 0.3 × 10 6 (HL-60) and 0.1 × 10 6 (MDA-MB435) cells/ml. Extracts and fractions were tested in a single concentration (100 μg/ml) and pure substances in a range between 0.048 and 25 μg/ml during 72 h. Control groups received the same amount of vehicle and doxorubicin (Doxolem®, Zodiac Produtos Farmacêuticos S/A, Brazil), which was used as a positive control. Growth inhibition rates were quantified as the percentage of control absorbance by the reduced dye at 550 nm in accordance with the following equation:
Inhibition rate = [(OD control well -OD treated well)× (OD control well) -1 ] × 100 .Each sample was tested in two independent experiments performed in triplicates. The results consisted of the average value for each experimental unit. The IC 50 values and their 95% confidence intervals were obtained by non linear regression using the GraphPad Prism program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA). An activity scale was utilized to appraise the cytotoxic potential of the tested samples: inactive samples (I), samples with low activity (LA, cell growth inhibition between 1 -50%), moderated activity (MA, cell growth inhibition between 50 -75%), and high activity (HA, cell growth inhibition between 75 -100%).
Results and discussion
Isolation and identification of fungal strainsAltogether 32 species of fungi were isolated and labeled using the plant name initial letters and a number, for example, SS29 (Table 1). The results indicated an uneven distribution of endophytic fungi within S. sonchi- folius tissues possibly demonstrating tissue specificity. Hence, it was possible to isolate eleven, six and nine species from stems, roots and leaves, respectively. A single species, SS21, displayed a systemic colonization and five other species occurred simultaneously in two tissues. Species SS13 was recovered from leaves and roots, SS36 grew from leaves and stems, while SS42, SS65 and SS67 were isolated from both stems and roots. Some strains did not sporulate or grow in the culture conditions employed. They remain unidentified and were named sterile mycelia. Isolates that sporulated were identified by traditional taxonomical methods based on morphological features as established in Table 1.The isolated genera Drechslera, Fusarium, Phoma, Alternaria, Curvularia, Nigrospora, Glomerella and Aspergilus have been previously reported as plant pathogens in a range of hosts [18 -20]. They also have proven to be endophytes in several plant species [21 -26] strengthen-ing the argument that disease is an exception in the plant-microbe interaction, which could be more properly regarded as an unbalanced status in a symbiosis [27]. Genus Papulaspora is a well-known competitive soil mold in the culture of mushrooms [28,29] and it has just been recently reported as an endophyte in a few species as Vitex negundo [24], Manilkara bidentata [30], Taxus chinensis [31], Amomum siamense [32] and Solanum tuberosum [25]. Preussia, however, is recognized either as a soil or a coprophilous genus [33,34] but has never been mentioned before as an endophyte.
Cytotoxic activity of extractsFrom the 32 fungal isolates, 186 extracts were obtained and tested against three tumor cell lines. EaL fractions had the most pronounced cytotoxic effects together with EaS fractions (Table 2), whereas fractions EtM, RL and RS were practically inactive (data not shown). The exceptions were RLSS33, RLSS75 and RLSS84, which Cytotoxic effects and ecological importance of isolated compounds N. sphaerica (SS67) and P. betae (SS84) were chosen for large scale cultures and isolation of bioactive compounds due to the cytotoxicity of their extracts.Three substances were isolated from the N. sphaerica EaS fraction (SS67, Fig. 4): compound 1 was identified as pimara-7,15-dien-3β-ol, compound 2 as ergosterol peroxide and compound 3 as aphidicolin. Spectral data of compound 2 were in agreement with literature data [35], while compound 1, recently detected in a plant essential oil, was not characterized by the authors [36]. This is the first report of compound 1 obtained from a fungal source and having its structure completely elucidated by 1 H and 13 C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, MS and NOEdiff spectral data. Both compounds 1 and 2 showed weak cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell lines tested (Table 3).Compound 3, isolated from the EaL fraction of N. sphaerica (SS67) had its structure established as the diterpene aphidicolin (Fig. 4) on the basis of its NMR data that are in agreement with reported data [37]. Aphidicolin showed a remarkable cytotoxic activity against all cell lines (Table 3), but its direct in vivo administration is difficult due to its poor water solubility and fast metabolization. Aphidicolin also may damage a fragile site of the mammalian genome [38,39]. How-ever, it is a valuable tool to study eukaryotic DNA synthesis and cell cycles.P. betae (SS84) EaL fraction actually showed maximal efficacy against all the three cancer cell lines and was considered highly active (Table 2). In liquid potatosucrose medium, P. betae is reported to produce an assortment of bioactive diterpenes [40,41], including aphidicolin (3), an specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Hence, the low cytotoxic activity of SS84 EaS fraction was intriguing (Table 2) and led us to investigate its chemical composition. For this purpose the fungus was cultivated for two different time periods: for 20 days according to the general protocol and for 32 days leading to sporulation. EaS fraction from 20 day cultures was subjected to chromatographic procedures and the resultant subfractions were monitored by GC/MS and 1 H NMR techniques. Several fatty acids were detected but only compound 2 was isolated corroborating the initial low activity. However, the EaS fraction resulting from 32 day cultures yielded compound 6, which was identified as dimethyl terephthalate (Fig. 4) [42], and a subfraction that inhibited 100% the proliferation of tumor cell lines tested. The subfraction 1 H NMR spectrum revealed a mixture of two substances in a 1 : 1 ratio, later separated and identified as (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8( 14),22-tetraen-3one (compound 4) and 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methylisocoumarin (compound 5) in accordance with literature data (Fig. 4) [43,44]. When compounds 4 and 5 were tested alone they showed moderate and weak activities, respectively (Table 3). The low cytotoxicity of compound 4 against other tumor cell lines had been previously described [45,46] but the results in this report suggest that isocoumarin (compound 5) and ergosteroid (compound 4) are acting synergistically. In fact, it has been reported that an isocoumarin propionic acid derivative has recently entered clinical trials as an anticancer and anti-angiogenic agent with the property of potentiating or improving either the therapeutic effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs [47,48] or radiotherapy [49].Our results suggest that compounds 4 and 5 might be considered as hits for drug development of a novel anticancer combination therapy. The amounts of pesticides employed in S. sonchifolius cultivation are relatively small leading some authors to suggest that sesquiterpene lactones [50] and kaurene diterpenoids [51] occuring in plant leaves may act as resistance factors. In fact, the endophytes P. betae and N. sphaerica and their host have similar biosynthetic pathways [52,53], and the fungal cytotoxic compounds may provide extra protection for the plant (Table 1). N. sphaerica is also known to cause both reduction of spore germination [54] and growth inhibition of some pathogenic fungi, i.e, Fusarium oxysporum [55,56], one of the isolated endophytic species in Yacon roots (Table 1). Therefore, maintenance of N. sphaerica and P. betae as endophytes seems to be an ecological benefit to S. sonchifolius.((Funded by: • Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) within the Biota-Bioprospecta-FAPESP; grant number: 05/56259-6 Figure 1 .1Figure 1.

It is noteworthy that only ethyl acetatefractions from both culture types of P. immersa (SS13),N. sphaerica (SS67) and A. tenuissima (SS77) produced goodresults on all tested cells indicating that productionof bioactive molecules by these fungi does not dependon the culture medium employed. These observationsemphasize the significance of these species in futurebiotechnology studies.
