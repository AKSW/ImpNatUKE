MOLLUSCICIDAL ACRIDONE ALKALOIDS FROM ANGOSTURA PANZCULATA: ISOLATION, STRUCTURES, AND SYNTHESIS
TWO novel acridone alkaloids, cuspanine [l]  and cusculine [2], were isolated from the CH,CI, extract o f the leaves ofAngostwapanirrrlataa (Rutaceae). Their structures were established as l-hydroxy-2,3,5,6-tetramethoxy-9-acridone for 1 and 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acridone for 2 by means of spectroscopic studies, in particular nmr. These structural assignments were confirmed by synthesis, using a direct metallation method as a key reaction. Both alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against an aquatic snail, B i aphalaria glabratu, and cytotoxicity against several types of carcinoma cell lines.

We have recently described the isolation of various alkloids from Brazilian Rutaceous plants: two molluscicidal quinoline alkaloids from the leaves of Gafipeu brarteata (l), and two insect-growth-inhibitory 4-quinolinone alkaloids from the leaves of Esenh k i a feiocarpa (2). In our continuing search for biologically active phytochemicals, two novel acridone alkaloids have been isolated from the leaves of another Brazilian Rutaceous plant, Angosturapanicufata (Engler) Elias. These alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal and cytotoxic activities and were designated cuspanine El} and cusculine [21.Their structures were established based largely on nmr studies. However, the structures established are rather uncommon among the known acridone alkaloids. Therefore, in order to confirm the structures, their syntheses were carried out. This paper reports the isolation, structure determination, and syntheses of 1 and 2.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAfter repeated and various column chromatographies, the CH,Cl, extract of the leaves ofA. panicufata yielded two new acridone alkaloids, cuspanine [I] and cusculine 121. In conjunction with both 'H-and ',C-nmr and eims data, the molecular formula C1,Hl,NO6 was assigned to cuspanine 111. In addition, together with the uv and ir data, an acridone-type structure could be assigned to cuspanine. This was apparent because keto group signals, characteristic of acridone at 6 181.14 (s) and 1635 cm-', were observed. The presence of a free phenolic group was deduced from the uv spectrum by using AICI, as the shift reagent. Thus, when afew drops ofAIC1, solution was added to cuspanine in MeOH, a typical bathochromic shift was observed. However, the region of 3000-3600 cm-' in the ir spectrum showed only weak and broad absorption, because the phenolic group forms a stable 6-membered ring intramolecular hydrogen bond with the keto group. The 'H-nmr spectrum of 1 showed two aromatic proton signals at 6 6.92 and 8.06 ( J = 8.0 Hz for each) which can be attributed to H-7 and H-8, respectively (3). This indicated the tetrasubstituted nature of ring C. The remaining signal at 6 6.23 (s) could be attributed to the aromatic proton at either H-2 or H-4. This was confirmed by 'H nmr using nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY). In the NOESY spectrum of cuspanine, an nOe was observed between the aromatic proton H-4 at 6 6.23 and the amine proton at 6 8.44. This result, itself, was conclusive for the assignment of the remaining proton to the 4 position in ring C. This conclusion also established the position of the remaining M e 0 group at the 2 position of ring A. Therefore, the structure 1 was proposed for cuspanine.Cusculine E21 is very closely related to cuspanine I l l . The only difference observed in the 'H-nmr spectrum was an additional peak for an M e 0 group, suggesting the presence of five M e 0 groups in the molecule. In addition to this observation, the bathochromic shift observed in the uv spectrum of 1 was not detected with 2, indicating that an M e 0 group was substituted for the phenolic group of 1. This was further supported by the 13C-nmr spectrum which showed three signals in lower field at 6 61.89, 61.53, and 60.94, indicating the presence of three hindered Me0 groups ( 4 ) and leading to structure 2 for cusculine. Cuspanine 121, 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acridone, was synthesized from 2bromo-3,Cdimethoxybenzoic acid [6]. The first method that was tried for the preparation of 6 was the bromination of isovanillin in refluxing CHCI,, followed by methylation (Me,S04) and oxidation (Jones' reagent). However, the bromination gave a poor yield (18%), so the following alternate approach, using a directed metallation method, was adopted.Wol. 55, No. 8 The methoxymethyl ether (MOM ether) 141, prepared from 3,4dimethoxybenzyl alcohol [3] and methoxymethyl chloride, was lithiated in Et,O with n-butyllithium at 0". The resulting yellow precipitates were treated with 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane (5)at -78', and the mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature to give a bromide 5 with a 66% yield. Hydrolysis of the MOM ether of 5 with HBr in warm EtOH, followed by oxidation with Jones' reagent, gave 6 in a 69% yield. Ullmann condensation (6) of 6 and 3,4,5-trimethoxyaniline [7l in the presence of freshly prepared copper powder and K,C03 in DMF gave 8 with a 56% yield appearing as orange plates. Treatment of 8 with polyphosphoric acid and xylene (7) at 150' gave 2 in the form of yellow prisms with a yield of 55%. Selective hydrolysis of the 1-MeO group of 2 was achieved by refluxing in MeOH with concentrated HCl and 70% HC104 to afford 1 (Scheme 1).The physical data for both 1 and 2 were identical with those of the natural products. The structure of 1 was unambiguously determined by a single crystal X-ray analysis (Figure 1). Both alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail Bimphakaria gkbrata. The LC5, of cuspanine fl] was 5 ppm and that of cusculine 121 was 20 ppm. There are only a few examples in the literature (8,9) where alkaloids exhibiting high toxicity to snails are observed. These two alkaloids also showed moderate cytotoxic activity against several carcinoma cell lines. The IC5,'s of 1 and 2 against HeIa epithelioid carcinoma cells were 2.5 and 8.5 pg/ml, respectively. In addition, they also inhibited the growth of BT-20 human breast carcinoma cells. were acidified with dilute HCI, extracted with CHCI,, dried, and evaporated.

The mixture was mechanically stirred vigorously at 140-150" for 1 h. After the reaction flask was cooled to mom temperature, H,O was added, and the solution was made basic with 5% aqueous NaOH and extracted with CHCI,.

Further elution gave the recovered 2 (89 mg, 40%). Other physical data were identical with those of natural product.CELL LINES AND MEDIA.-AII cell lines used for the assay were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). They are HeLa ATCC CCL 2 19, epithelioid cerevix carcinoma from human, and BT-20 ATCC HTB 19, breast carcinoma from human. Both cell lines were maintained on minimum essential medium (Eagle) with non-essential amino acids supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and incubated in a humidified atomosphere of 5% C02-95% air at 37". These human monolayer cultures were subcultured with a 0.25% trypsidEDTA solution.CYTOTOXICITY ASSAY.-The cytotoxicity assays were performed by a microculture tetrazolium (h4YY) (Sigma) method (12). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated into 96-well microtitre plates at 4@304000 celldwell, with various concentrations ofthe samples. After incubation, 50 pl M l T ( 3 mglml in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The formazan dye ws solubilized by adding 100 pl DMSO to each well, followed by gentle shaking. The extinction ccef6cient was measured for each well using a Uniskan I Photometer Labsystems, at a wavelength of 620 run.SCHEME 1. Syntheses of 1 and 2.

EXPERIMENTAL GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.-AII the pnxedures were the same as previously described (2). ISOLATION OF CONSTITUENTs.-The leaves ofA. pnicvhtu were collected in Minas e r a i s , Brazil, in February 1988, and identified by Dr. Jd R. Pirani, Instituto de BiociEncias, Universidade de So Paulo, So Paulo, SP. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium ofthis institute. The dried pulverized leaves were first extracted with CH2C12 followed by MeOH at ambient temperature. A subsequent molluscicidal bioassay using B . gkzbrata indicated the CH2CI, extract to be active. The CH2CI, extract (2.983 g) was chromatographed over Si gel, using CH,CI,, EtOAc, and MeOH. This process yielded 11 fractions. The bioactive fraction, eluted with EtOAc, was rechromatographed over Si gel (Lichroprep), affording c u s p i n e [l] (60 mg). The fractions eluted with MeOH after the same procedure gave cusculine 121 (200 mg).
