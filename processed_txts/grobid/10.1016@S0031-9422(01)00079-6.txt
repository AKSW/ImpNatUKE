Antifungal polysulphides from Petiveria alliacea L
Bioactivity-directed fractionation of the CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (2:1, v/v) extract of the roots of Petiveria alliacea, using mutant yeast strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum led to the isolation of dipropyl disulphide (1), dibenzyl sulphide (2), dibenzyl disulphide (3), dibenzyl trisulphide (4), dibenzyl tetrasulphide (5), benzylhydroxymethyl sulphide (6) and di(benzyltrithio) methane (7). Of these, 5-7 are new compounds and this is the first report of the natural occurrence of 2 and 3.

IntroductionPetiveria alliacea L. (Phytolacaceae) is a shrub widely distributed in South and Central America. It grows in all regions of Brazil where it is known by many popular names. Among these, ''erva-guine´'', ''guine´'', ''pipi'' and ''tipi''; and the Tupi-Guarani ''macuracaa´'' are noteworthy (Hoehne, 1939;Pio Correa, 1969). In the State of Minas Gerais the roots of this plant are used to treat rheumatism (De Sousa et al., 1987) and in other Brazilian regions, both the roots and the leaves are popularly used as stimulants and abortefacients (Da Silva, 1935). Previous work on P. alliacea revealed the occurrence of coumarins, triterpenes and flavonoids (Rocha and Da Silva, 1969;Delle Monache and Suarez, 1992), amino acids and trisulphide (Adegosan, 1974). In continuing our search for biologically active compounds from the Brazilian flora (Carbonezi et al., 1999), a CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (2:1 v/v) extract of the roots of this plant was selected for phytochemical investigation due to its significant activity against some mutant yeast strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Gunatilaka et al., 1994) and inhibition of the growth of Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). This study led to the isolation of five new polysulphides (2, 3, 5, 6 and 7), together with two known compounds (1,4). Among the known compounds described in this study, only compound 4 had been previously isolated from this plant species (De Sousa et al., 1990).
Results and discussionThe CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (2:1) extract of roots of P. alliacea L. inhibited strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RS 188N, RS 52YK and RS 321) indicating strong activity of this extract towards the mutant strains of yeast. This extract was also shown to possess potent inhibitory activity against Cladosporium cladosporioides and Cladosporium sphaerospermum fungi. Solvent-solvent partitioning of the bioactive crude extract afforded hexane, CHCl 3 and EtOAc fractions, in which the activities were concentrated. These fractions were individually subjected to silica gel column chromatography, using CH 2 Cl 2 or CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH as eluents, to obtain six major bioactive fractions. The purification of these fractions was performed on silica gel preparative TLC, reversed-phase Sep Pak cartridge and HPLC affording seven bioactive polysulphide compounds.The molecular formula of compound 1 was determined as C 6 H 14 S 2 , by 1 H, 13 C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Three resonances at 2.66 t (J=7.25 Hz), 1.72 dq (J=7.5, 6.5) and 0.99 t (J=7.26 Hz) in the 1 H NMR spectrum were characteristic of a propyl moiety (Table 1). The 13 C NMR data also supported the propyl skeleton (Table 2). The proton resonance at 2.66, corresponding to a methylene group, was attributed to a sulfur-bearing carbon atom, which was confirmed by elemental analysis and interpretation of its mass spectrum. According to these data the structure of 1 was assigned as dipropyl disulphide, which is reported as a natural derivative in Phytolacaceae for the first time.Compounds 2-5 exhibited common features in their MS, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra. The presence of a significant ion peak at m/z 91, which is characteristic of a benzyl fragment was observed in all mass spectra of these compounds. The benzyl portion appeared to bear one, two, three and four sulfur atoms, respectively, based on the elemental analyses. The 1 H NMR spectra (Table 1) of 2, 3, 4 and 5 presented the same signal, around 7.30, compatible with a monosubstituted aromatic ring. The major differences observed in the 1 H NMR spectra of each compound was due to the chemical shift of the methylene benzylic hydrogens linked to the sulfur, which in compound 2 appeared at 3.66; 3 at 4.05; 4 at 4.15 (De Souza et al., 1990) and 5 at 4.19, respectively. The 13 C NMR spectral data (Table 2) of these compounds, interpreted with the aid of DEPT spectra, indicated the presence of one quaternary C and five CH's sp 2 carbons attributable to an aromatic monosubstituted ring and one sp 3 CH 2 assigned to a benzylic carbon. The elemental analysis and HRMS data of compounds 2-5 firmly established the number (and amount) of sulfur atoms in these polysulphides and confirmed their identities as dibenzyl sulphide (2), dibenzyl disulphide (3), dibenzyl trisulphide ( 4) and dibenzyl tetrasulphide (5), respectively. Polysulphide 4 has previously been reported from this species (De Souza et al., 1990).Compound 6, isolated as an oil, gave IR absorption bands at 3335 (OH), 1580, and 1495 cm À1 (Ar). The EI MS showed a molecular ion peak [M] + at m/z 154 that together with 13 C NMR and elemental analysis established a molecular formula of C 8 H 10 SO. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and2) of this compound resembled closely those of dibenzyl sulphide (2). Prominent differences in the 1 H and 13 C spectroscopic values between 2 and 6 were observed only in the aliphatic region; one extra methylene signal was observed at 5.03 s ( 78.50, CH 2 ). These results allowed us to deduce that compound  6 had an hydroxymethyl group linked to the sulfur in place of the second benzylic group as in compound 2. Interpretation of some HMBC data (Fig. 1) aided elucidation of this structure. Correlations observed between the methylene protons signal at 5.03 with the benzylic carbon at 44.27 and the methylene protons signal at 3.60 with the carbons at 78.50 and 127.42 established compound 6 as benzylhydroxymethyl monosulphide.Polysulphide 7 is closely comparable with dibenzyl trisulphide (4); comparison of the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and2) data with those of 4 showed that the only differences observed were due to chemical shift of the benzylic hydrogens, which in 7 appeared at 4.20 ( C =43.19) and the presence of an additional singlet signal at 5.30, which was attributed to methylene protons by the analysis inferred by COSY, HMQC and DEPT spectral data. Analysis of 13 C NMR spectroscopic data recorded a methylene benzylic carbon at 43.19 and a second one, extremely unshielded at 106.32, whose chemical shift could be explained by the stereoeletronic effects of several sulfur atoms linked to methylene carbon. In fact, no correlations were observed in the spectra of the 1 H-1 H COSY and HMBC (Fig. 1) of the corresponding methylene protons with other protons or carbons, respectively in 7. The elemental analysis, together with HRMS analysis established its molecular formula as C 15 H 16 S 6 and thus confirmed 7 to be di(benzyltrithio) methane.Bioautography with the plant pathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum was employed to guide fractionation and isolation of the polysulphides 1-7, these being responsible for the fungicidal activity detected in the crude extract (Table 3). Similar or higher to the reference compound Nystatin, the polysulphides 1-4 showed potent inhibition, while compounds 5-7 showed marginal activity against fungal growth (10.0 >25 and 5.0 mg, respectively), in both phytopathogenic strains tested. Furthermore, their potential anticancer activities were also tested, using a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents (Gunatilaka et al., 1994). Compounds 1, 3 and 5 had moderate effect on DNA, as deduced by the selective inhibition of the mutant strains RS 321 and RS 52YK, relative to the wild strain RS 188N (Table 3).
Experimental
Instrumentation1 H NMR (300 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX-300 spectrometer, using TMS as an int. standard. The 13 C NMR (50 or 75 MHz) spectra were recorded on Bruker AC-200 and DPX-300 spectrometer. EI-MS were measured at 70 eV on a HP 5990/ 5988 A spectrometer and on a VG platform II spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer CHN Elemental Analyzer 2400. IR spectra were recorded on a FT-IR 1750 Perkin Elmer and FT-IR 510 Nicolet. UV spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer UV/vis Hitachi U-3000.
Plant materialThe species Petiveria alliacea L. was collected in September and October (1997) in the Instituto ButantaR eserve, in the city of Sa˜o Paulo. Whole shrubs were collected and separated in their distinct parts: leaves, stems and roots. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botaˆnica-SMA, under the number SP112.6.84.
Biological testingDNA-damaging assay with mutant yeast S. cerevisiae: Experimental screening methods utilizing mutant strains of S. cerevisiae have been described elsewhere (Gunatilaka et al., 1992). The IC 12 values refer to the concentration in mg/ml required to produce a inhibition zone of 12 mm in diameter around a 100 ml well during a 48 h incubation period at 30 C. TLC bioautography assay: Cladosporium cladosporioides Fresen de Vries SPC 140 and Cladosporium sphaerospermum Penzig SPC 491 were maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica-SMA. Ten microliters of the solutions of crude extracts, fractions and pure compounds were prepared, in different concentrations: corresponding to 20, 10, 1, 0.1 mg for pure compounds and 100, 50, 30 and 20 mg for the crude extracts or fractions, respectively. The samples were applied to TLC plates, these being eluted with the appropriate solvent system followed by complete removal of the solvent. The chromatographic plates were sprayed with spores suspension of C. sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides in a nutritive medium and incubated for 48 h at 37 C. After incubation, clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background chromatogram.
Extraction and isolation of constituentsRoots, stems, and leaves of P. alliacea L. were dried at room temperature, powdered and extracted three times with CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH (2:1, v/v), for two days, at room temperature. The resulting extracts were filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield 7.0, 8.0 and 15 g of root, stem and leaf extracts, respectively. Due to the higher bioactivity noted, half of the root extract was suspended in MeOH:H 2 O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol. After liquid/liquid partition, the resulting residue was concentrated in vacuo and extracted with H 2 O. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the hexane, CHCl 3 , and EtOAc solubles, using silica gel column chromatography and hexane, CH 2 Cl 2 , CH 2 Cl 2 :EtOAc and CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH (with increasing polarity) as eluants, afforded several fractions, whose bioactivities were detected only in six of them. The first hexane fraction was applied to a Si gel column eluting with a hexane:CH 2 Cl 2 gradient to afford compound 1 (22 mg). The fractions eluted with CH 2 Cl 2 :EtOAc were further subjected to silica gel column chromatography using a MeOH:H 2 O gradient. The intermediary fractions of this column, purified by HPLC using a C-18 Econosil column, 5 mm, 250Â4 mm i.d., with an elution gradient of MeOH:H 2 O (70:30) 7 min; MeOH:H 2 O (90:10) 15 min. and MeOH (100%) 20 min with flow rate of 1 ml/min yielded the compounds 2 (7.8 mg), 3 (4.5 mg), 4 (15.0 mg) and 5 (3.6 mg). The EtOAc soluble fraction, was subjected to Si gel column chromatography using CH 2 Cl 2 :EtOAc with increasing polarity. The fractions obtained with CH 2 Cl 2 : EtOAc (7:3) afforded 6 (3.8 mg). Compound 7 (2.0 mg) was isolated from the hexane fraction, by further purification over column chromatography on Si gel eluted with CH 2 Cl 2 :EtOAc (8:2).Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.
