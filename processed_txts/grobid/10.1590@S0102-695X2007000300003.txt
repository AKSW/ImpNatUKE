INTRODUCTIONSpecies of the Ochnaceae family are distributed in tropical and subtropical zones throughout the World (Hegnauer, 1969;Carvalho et al., 2000) This family is characterized by the presence of fl avonoids and bifl avonoids and terpenoids as main secondary metabolites (Oliveira et al., 2002;Estevam et al 2005). Several members of the Ouratea genus are employed for the extraction of edible oil, and are used as medicinal plants (Moreira et al., 1994;Agra et al., 2007). As part of our research program on the bioactive constituents of Atlantic Forest plant species, we have investigated Ouratea multifl ora collected in Juréia Reserve, São Paulo State. As result, four fl avonoid dimers: heveafl avone (Geiger, 1986) amentofl avone-7′′,4′′′-dimethyl-ether (Geiger, 1986), podocarpusfl avone-A (Geiger, 1986;Markham et al., 1987) and amentofl avone (Geiger, 1986;Markham et al., 1987;Felício et al., 2001), were isolated from the ethanolic extract of the leaves. Additionally, the biological activity of the isolates was also evaluated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
General procedure1 H and 13 C NMR, inverse heteronuclear HMQC and HMBC as well as COSY experiments were performed on a Varian Inova 500 MHz instrument operating at 500 MHz for hydrogen, and 125 MHz for carbon, respectively. Pyridine-d 5 or DMSO-d 6 were used as solvents and TMS as internal standard. TLC was performed on precoated aluminum sheets (silica F 254 , 0.25 mm, Merck, Parmtadt, Germany) with detection provided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and by spraying with anisaldeyde reagent followed by heating (120 °C). Silica gel (230-400 mesh ASTM, particle size 0.040-0.063 µM, Merck) or Sephaex LH-20 (Pharmacia) were used in the CC fractionations.
Plant materialOuratea multifl ora was collected at the Botanical reserve of Juréia, São Paulo, Brazil and a voucher was placed at the Botanical Institute, São Paulo State, Brazil.
Extraction and isolationDried powdered leaves of Ouratea multifl ora (118.0 g) were extracted by maceration using ethanol at room temperature. The extract was fi ltered and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude extract (3.44 g) was dissolved in n-BuOH. Subsequent addition of water afforded two phases which were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The n-BuOH fraction (2.10 g) was solubilized with methanol/water (8:2 v/v) and partitioned with n-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate, successively. The ethyl acetate phase after concentration of the solvent (980.0 mg), was chromatographed on a Sephadex LH-20 column with a gradient elution of MeOH/H 2 O. The separation was monitored by TLC, and eluted fractions exhibiting similar appearances were combined, yielding 20 fractions. Fractions 7 and 8 showed a solid precipitation. The solid was washed with cold methanol to afford heveafl avone (Geiger, 1986) (1) (21.2 mg). Fraction 13 was chromatographed on silica gel yielding amentofl avone 7", 4"'-dimethyl ether (2) (10.8 mg). Fraction 15 gave a powder after precipitation. This powder was washed with cold methanol to afford podocarpusfl avone-A 3 (Markam et al., 1987) (8.9 mg). Fraction 17 was chromatographed on silica gel using CHCl 3 :MeOH (4:6) yielding amentofl avone 4 (Geiger, 1986;Markham et al., 1987) (15.0 mg).
Antimicrobial assaySterile fi lter paper disks were impregnated with 20 mg of samples using DMSO as carrier solvent. The impregnated disks were then placed on agar plates previously inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 2592) and Bacillus subtilis (DSM 2105). Solvent controls were incubated at 37 o C for each organism, and after incubate time of 24 h at 37 o C, antimicrobial activity was recorded as clear zones (in mm) of inhibition surrounding the disk. The sample was considered active when the inhibition surrounding the disk was greater than 7 mm.
Cytotoxicity assayAntiproliferative activity was examined against two cell lines and was determined through an MTT assay as described earlier (Edrada et al., 1996).
TLC screening for acetylcholinesterase inhibitorsThe protocol adopted for this in vitro assay is described by Ellman and co-workers (Ellman et al., 1961).
Determination of the radical-scavenging activityThe determination of the antioxidant activity was tested according to a protocol described elsewhere (Cardoso et al., 2004;So;Lewis, 2002). H 1 (δ H , J in Hz) 2 (δ H , J in Hz) 3 (δ H , J in Hz) 4 (δ H , J in
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe chromatographic fractionation of the ethanol extract from the leaves of O. multifl ora afforded heveafl avone (1), amentofl avone-7′′,4′′′-dimethyl-ether (2), podocarpusfl avone-A (3), and amentofl avone (4). Table 2. 13 C NMR spectral data for compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 (125MHz, DMSO-d 6 )The 1 H NMR spectrum showed signals for two chelated hydroxyls at δ H 13.19 and 12.93 (OH-5 and OH-5"), three aromatic methoxyl groups, a 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic ring (B ring) and a 1,4-disubstituted (B' ring).The 1 H NMR spectra [1D and 2D ( 1 H-1 H-COSY)] showed a para-substituted aromatic ring at δ H 7.55 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-2"', H-6"'), δ H 6.82 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-3"', H-5"'), two meta aromatic hydrogens at δ H 6.23 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-6), 6.49 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-8), commonly observed in a fl avone nucleous. The structure of 1 was established on the basisi of HMBC spectra, which showed heteronuclear longrange couplings of quaternary carbons C-7'' (δ C 161.2), C-7 (δ C 164.8) and C-4"' (δ C 162.4) with the hydrogens of methoxyl groups at δ H 3.72 (OMe-7''), 3.77 (OMe-7), and 3.81 (OMe-4"'), respectively, and by comparison of their spectral data with those reported for heveafl avone (Geiger, 1986).Compound 2 also showed spectral features of a fl avonoid dimer derivative (Table 2). The 1 H MNR spectrum (Table 1) of 2 showed the presence of to chelated hydroxyl and at δ H 3.83 and δ H 3.75 two methoxyl groups. The 1 H-1 H-COSY spectrum of compound 2 showed a set of doublets at δ H 7.66 (d, J 9.5 Hz, H-2"', H-6"') and δ H 6.91 (d, J 9.5 Hz, H-3"', H-5"') of an AA'BB' system, besides the signals at δ H 7.98 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-2'), 7.14 (d, J 8.5, H-5') and 8.01 (dd, J 8.5; 2.5, H-6') attributed to a 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic ring. Furthermore, the 1 H-1 H-COSY spectrum showed signals with a meta coupling pattern at δ H 6.17 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-6) and 6.45 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-8) corresponding to an A ring of a fl avone. The HMBC spectrum of 2 revealed correlations of the hydrogen-bonded OH-5 (δ H 12.94) with C-5 (δ C 161.4), C-6 (δ C 98.8) and C-10 (δ C 103.7), while OH-5" (δ H 13.20) correlated with C-5" (δ C 161.4), C-6" (δ C 95.6) and C-10" (δ C 104.2). From the long range coupling of H-6 (δ H 6.17) and H-3 (δ H 6.82) with C-10 (δ C 103.7); H-3"' and H-5"' (δ H 6.91) with C-1"' (δ C 122.9); and H-3" (δ H 6.92) with C-10" (δ C 104.2) thus, the structure of 2 was established to be a dimer. A literature search confi rmed the structure of 2 as 7",4"'dimethoxy-amentofl avone (Geiger, 1986).1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of 3 showed signals at δ H 13.05, δ C 182.2, δ H 12.95, and δ C 181.8 of two hydrogen of chelated hydroxyl groups, and an O-methyl group at δ H 3.74 (δ C 55.5). A detailed analysis of cross peaks from the 1 H-1 H COSY spectrum showed two doublets for a mono-oxygenated para disubstituted system at δ H 7.65 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-2"', H-6"') and 6.91 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-3"', H-5"'), one trioxygenated tetra substituted ring with alternating oxy-substituents at δ H 6.17 (d, J 1.5 Hz, H-6) and δ H 6.45 (d, J 1.5 Hz, H-8), and one mono-oxygenated trisubstituted system at δ H 7.98 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-2'), 7.15 (d, J 8.5 Hz, H-5') and 8.00 (dd, J 8.5; 2.5 Hz, H-6'). Additional 1D and 2D NMR data indicated a pentasubstituted aromatic ring with a 5,7dioxygenation pattern for the A' ring of a fl avone (δ H 6.41, H-6") and two singlets (δ H 6.81 (H-3), δ H 6.86 (H-3'') of both fl avones units in compound 3. Analysis of HMBC spectra revealed characteristic correlations which defi ned the positions of aromatic rings and their substitution patterns. Correlations of H-3 (δ 6.81) with C-2 (δ 163.8), C-4 (δ 181.7), C-10 (δ 103.7), C-1' (δ 121.1) and H-3" (δ 6.86) with C-2" (δ 163.2), C-4" (δ 182.2), C-10" (δ 103.7), C-1"' (δ 123.0) established the linkages between rings C/B and C"/B", respectively. Moreover, the correlation between H-2' (δ 7.98) and C-8" (δ 104.0) showed the linkage between C-3'and C-8". The ROESY correlation observed between methoxyl group at δ H 3.74 and the aromatic protons at δ H 6.91 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-3"', H-5"') justify the location of the methoxyl group at C-4"' of the B' aromatic ring. These data are in agreement with those published for podocarpusfl avone-A (Geiger, 1986;Markham, et al., 1987).1 H NMR spectrum of 4 showed two signals at δ H 13.09 and 12.96 due to chelated phenolic hydroxyls, and two doublets at δ H 7.56 (J 9.0 Hz, H-2"', H-6"'), and 6.70 (J 9.0 Hz, H-3"', H-5"') assigned to an AA'BB' aromatic system. Signals of a trisubstituted aromatic ring containing one oxygenated carbon were observed at δ H 8.00 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-2'), 7.14 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-5'), and 7.99 (dd, J 9.0; 2.5 Hz H-6'), along with doublets of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring containing three oxygenated carbons at δ H 6.18 (J 2.5 Hz, H-6) and 6.45 (J 2.5 Hz, H-8). Analysis of the HMBC spectra evidenced correlations of the hydroxyl group with hydrogen bonded by cross peak at δ H 13.09 (OH-5) with C-5" (δ 161.1), C-6" (δ 98.7), and C-10" (δ 103.6) and δ H 12.96 (OH-5") with C-5 (δ 162.1), C-6 (δ 98.9) and C-10 (δ 103.7), which are in agreement to those of amentofl avone (Geiger, 1986;Markham et al., 1987).Previous studies on 13 C NMR data for amenthofl avone derivative dimers indicated a close relationship between substituent effects and chemical shift for the inter-fl avonoid linkage: a) amenthofl avones; I-3' (+ 6 ppm), II-8'' (+ 10 ppm), b) dihydroamenthofl avone; I-3'(+ 4 ppm), II-8" (+ 9 ppm), which can be diagnostic values in the recognition of new bifl avones in the amenthofl avone series (Markhan, et al., 1987;Felício, et al., 2001). The values of 13 C NMR spectra of 1-4 (Table 2) followed logically the average found to the series reported and indicated that O-methylation induced shifts that are in the same direction as those reported for monofl avonoids (Markham, 1978).The bifl avonoids were assayed for cytotoxicity toward mouse lymphoma (L5178) and melanoma cancer cell line (KB) (Edrada et al., 1996). None of the compounds were active toward the cell line, however, they showed weak activity against the Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus and B. subitilis at the concentrations of 0.5 and 10 µg/mL (Table 3). The reference antibiotic, streptomycin sulfate, inhibited the growth of all bacterial species tested in this study at 5 µg/mL (zone inhibition = 30-35 mm). Compounds 1-4 also were submitted to preliminary TLC screening for selecting potential  Table 1 .1Hz)1 H NMR data for compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 (500MHz, DMSO-d 6 )
The13 C NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed 31 signals, which were attributed to twelve sp 2 CH, including signals at δ CH 114.1 and 127.6, each representing two carbon atoms, three sp 3 carbons (δ CH3 55.1, 55.5 and 55.9), sixteen sp 2 quaternary carbons and two carbonyl groups (δ C 181.6 and 182.2) (Table2).C1 (δ)2 (δ)3 (δ)4 (δ)2163.9163.6163.8163.93103.1103.1103.0102.94181.6181.8181.7181.85162.0161.4161.5162.1697.798.898.898.97164.8164.1164.1164.2892.094.194.094.19157.1157.4157.4157.410104.6103.7103.7103.71'120.9121.2121.1120.92'130.9131.3131.4131.43'119.4119.6119.9120.14'159.3159.4159.5159.75'116.0116.2116.2116.26'127.5128.0127.9127.82"163.4163.7163.2163.73"102.9103.2103.2102.64"182.2182.4182.2182.25"161.5161.4160.6161.16"95.095.698.798.77"161.2162.8161.9160.68"104.7105.0104.0104.19"153.6153.7154.5154.510"104.2104.2103.7103.61'"122.8122.9123.0121.42'"127.6128.1128.0128.23'"114.1114.5114.5115.84'"162.4162.3162.2161.55'"114.1114.5114.5115.86'"127.6128.1128.0128.2CH 3 O-4'''55.956.555.5-CH 3 O-7''55.555.5--CH 3 O-755.1---
