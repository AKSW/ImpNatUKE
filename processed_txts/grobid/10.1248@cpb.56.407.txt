Antinociceptive Profile of 2,3,6-Trisubstituted Piperidine Alkaloids: 3-O-Acetyl-spectaline and Semi-synthetic Derivatives of (؊)-Spectaline
Several species of Cassia are widely used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial, laxative, antiulcerogenic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, which could be correlated with the accumulation of phenolic compounds in their bioactive extracts. [1][2][3][4][5] In previous investigations, we re-ported the isolation, the structural elucidation and the bioactivity profile of (Ϫ)-spectaline and other related piperidine alkaloids from Cassia spectabilis (sin. Senna spectabilis). 6,7) More recently we have identified (Ϫ)-spectaline (LASSBio-754, Chart 1) as a potent antinociceptive agent in the

writhing test (ED 50 ϭ48.5 mmol/kg) and capsaicin induced pain (ED 50 ϭ20.8 mmol/kg). 8) Extending our research program concerning the bioprospection of natural products and its derivatives, we have selected, to conclude this investigation, another abundant piperidine alkaloid, (Ϫ)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755, Chart 1) and synthesized other 10 semi-synthetic derivatives prepared from natural (Ϫ)-spectaline, i.e. a series of 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine alkaloids. The present study was focused on the synthesis, evaluation of antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of these new derivatives in order to verify the stereoelectronic contributions and requirements of the pharmacophoric groups A, B and C for the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities (Chart 1).
Results and DiscussionThe antinociceptive profile of all new 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine derivatives developed herein was initially evaluated using classical acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constriction test, 9) with indomethacin as standard. The results are disclosed in Fig. 1. Some of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 mmol/kg significantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than (Ϫ)-spectaline and indomethacin. Among them, the natural acetate derivative (LASSBio-755) and its O-Boc analogue (LASSBio-776) were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. Based on these results some preliminary structure-activity relationships were analysed. Comparing the inhibitory profile of compounds LASSBio-782, LASSBio-821 and LASSBio-775 with LASSBio-776 and LASSBio-755 indicates that the presence of groups that blocked the hydrogen bond donnor character of the piperidine nitrogen seems to be deletery for the analgesic activity. On the other hand, the antinociceptive activity showed to be inversely dependent of the volume of the groups at C-3 (OR 1 group) once that the inhibition of the constrictions follows the order R 1 ϭHϾAcϾBoc. The introduction of more polar and hydrogen bond-donating hydroxy groups at C-13Ј in the alcohol or oxime derivatives, i.e. LASSBio-781, LASSBio-820 and LASSBio-784, did not result in a increase of the antinociceptive activity but indicated through the direct comparison of the bioprofile of compounds LASSBio-781 and LASSBio-820 that the stereochemistry at C-3 seems to be a pharmacophoric requirement for an adequate fit in the target receptor. Additionally, the introduction of an acetyl group at C-3 of LASSBio-755 modify drastically the toxicological aspect of these alkaloids, once that it did not show any sign of toxicity when administered at a single dose of 500 mmol/kg (data not shown) in contrast with (Ϫ)-spectaline (LASSBio-754). 8) Considering the significant antinociceptive activity observed for LASSBio-755 and its analogue LASSBio-776 we decided to investigate its effects on other models of pain and compare the results with that showed by (Ϫ)-spectaline (LASSBio-754). 8) In the formalin-induced pain 10) only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the inflammatory phase, (Ϫ)-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity (Fig. 2). Indomethacin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the later phase without interfering on the earlier one in the formalin-induced pain test. 11) These results on the formalin test led us to investigate the anti-inflammatory profile of these same compounds on the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. 9) LASSBio-755 and, unexpectedly, LASSBio-776 did not show an anti-inflammatory activity at the dose used. Only (Ϫ)-spectaline was able to inhibit the edema formation, showing an ED 50 value of 56.6 mmol/kg (Fig. 3). The same order of potency was observed for both antinociceptive (ED 50 ϭ48.5 mmol/kg) 8) and anti-inflammatory (ED 50 ϭ56.6 mmol/kg) (Fig. 3) activities of (Ϫ)-spectaline (LASSBio-754), indicating a common pathway of action.Despite the absence of effect on the neurogenic phase of the formalin test at the dose used, LASSBio-755 and LASS-Bio-776 showed a significant increase in the latency time in the hot-plate test, 12) similar to morphine, while (Ϫ)-spectaline (LASSBio-754), even at a dose of 300 mmol/kg, was inactive (Fig. 4).The hot-plate and formalin test differs in some aspects. Hot-plate test is based on the use of a short-duration nociceptive thermal stimulus (phasic pain) while formalin use a long-duration chemical stimulus (tonic pain). Tissue injury leads to a persistent afferent input in the latter. The nociceptive response in the first phase of formalin and hot-plate models seems to result from direct activation of nociceptors and is inhibited by drugs which act mainly at central sites. 13,14) Centrally acting analgesics are also effective in the second phase. 10) This phase is attributed mainly to the development of an inflammatory reaction at the site of injection and increased synaptic transmission in the spinal cord. 13)   Considering the central activity observed for LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 in the hot-plate test, it was expected to observe some activity in the earlier phase of the formalin that could be dependent of the magnitude of the dose. The first phase of formalin is brief and occurs in the first 5 min. The first measure in the hot-plate test was at 30 min and only LASSBio-755 showed a significant activity. LASSBio-776 showed a significant activity from 60 min. Since the compounds were administered orally and the dose used was the same in both tests, the lack of activity on the neurogenic phase could be related with the pharmacokinetics profile of the compounds and somewhat with the mechanisms of the pain processing in these different models.Recently, searching for new candidates compounds useful for treating Alzheimer's disease, the chloride analogues of some of these semi-synthetic piperidine alkaloid derivatives were described as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. 15) The cholinergic system was involved in the transmission of nociceptive information and cholinergic drugs, such as muscarinic and nicotinic agonists, and also acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were described to induce antinociception. [16][17][18] The acetylcholine-induced constriction test has been used for screening analgesic compounds. 19) In this model (Ϫ)-spectaline and LASSBio-776 similarly inhibited the constrictions by 44.7% and 47.9%, respectively, while LASSBio-755 showed a more important antinociceptive effect, inhibiting the constrictions by 82% (Fig. 5). These results in addition with the hot-plate test and the acetylcholinesterase inhibition 15) suggest the involvement of the cholinergic system in the antinociceptive response elicited by LASSBio-776 and LASSBio-755.Taken together these results suggest differents mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio-776 (3-O-Boc-spectaline) and LASSBio-755 (3-O-acetylspectaline), acting mainly by modulation of receptors located at central nervous system, and for (Ϫ)-spectaline (LASSBio-754) that showed to be a peripheral analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.In conclusion, this study revealed new analgesic compounds derived from (Ϫ)-spectaline without apparent toxicity and gave support to the strategy of modifications of isolated natural products from brazilian biodiversity seeking the optimization of the biological activities in the search of new drug candidates.
ExperimentalChemistry The natural alkaloids (Ϫ)-spectaline (LASSBio-754) and (Ϫ)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) were obtained from the ethanolic extract of flowers of Cassia spectabilis (DC.) IRWIN et BARN (Leguminosae), as previously described. 6,7) For the preparation of the target derivatives from (Ϫ)-spectaline (LASS-Bio-754) the reaction sequences outlined in Chart 2 were followed. Reaction of LASSBio-754 with HCl under anhydrous conditions in CH 2 Cl 2 yielded the hidrochloride LASSBio-768. Carbamate LASSBio-775 and carbonate LASSBio-776 were prepared, as a 1 : 2 mixture, by reaction of LASSBio-754 with (BOC) 2 O/Et 3 N in CH 2 Cl 2 . [20][21][22] Silyl ether LASSBio-777 was obtained by reaction of LASSBio-754 with tert-butyl dimethyl silyl triflate (TBSOTf)/2,6-lutidine in CH 2 Cl 2 . 23,24) Treatment of carbonate LASSBio-776 with BzCl/4-DMAP/Et 3 N 25,26) and MsCl/Et 3 N in CH 2 Cl 2 afforded Nbenzoyl carbonate LASSBio-782 and N-methanesulfonyl carbonate LASS-Bio-821, respectively. Oxidation of LASSBio-754 under Jones conditions yielded the diketone LASSBio-766, that was subsequently reduced with LiAlH 4 in THF to afford LASSBio-820. Reduction of LASSBio-754 with NaBH 4 in MeOH furnished LASSBio-781, that differs from LASSBio-820 at the absolute configuration on C-3. Finally, LASSBio-754 was converted into the oxime LASSBio-784 by reaction with NH 2 OH • HCl in pyridine/ EtOH. 27,28) Melting points were determined with a Microquimica MQAPF-301 melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra were

Then, catalytic amount of 4-DMAP, 0.1 ml Et 3 N and 0.36 mmol BzCl were added in sequence. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature and N 2 atmosphere for 3.5 h period. After total conversion of starting material, 10 ml CH 2 Cl 2 of added and the solution washed with aqueous HCl 10% and saturated NaHCO 3 . The organic extract was dried over MgSO 4 , evaporated and purified by preparative TLC using EtOAc (4) : hexane (6) as eluent, furnishing 51.1 mg of a pale yellow oil. Yield 79%.  solution was added until the change of its color was observed to become permanently green. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h period, and the precipitated formed was removed by filtration; 5 ml of saturated NaHCO 3 was added to resultant solution, that was kept stirring for additional 10 min up to pH 10. This solution was extracted with EtOAc, dried over MgSO 4 , evaporated and purified by Al 2 O 3 column chromatography using EtOAc (3) : hexane (7) as eluent, furnishing 70.9 mg of a brown oil.

Then, 0.31 mmol (100 mg) of 2-(R)-methyl-6-(S)-(tetradecyl-13Ј-one)-piperidin-3one, dissolved in 0.5 ml THF, was added, drop to drop, and reaction carried out for 2 h period. Reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.43 ml of H 2 O, 0.43 ml of aqueous NaOH 15% and more 1.3 ml of H 2 O, subsequently. The mixture was stirred overnight, filtrated, extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 , dried over MgSO 4 and concentrated, resulting in 90 mg of de diol as oil. Yield 90%. Pharmacology Experiments were carried out in albino swiss mice (20-25 g) and rats (150-200 g) of both sexes from LASSBio (Faculty of Pharmacy, UFRJ, Brazil) breeding unit. All animals were kept in standardized conditions, maintained only with water ad libitum for 12 h before the experiment. Animal experiments were performed according to the "Principles of Laboratory Animal Care and Use in Research" (Colégio Brasileiro de Experimentação Animal-COBEA/Instituto Brasileiro Carlos Chagas Filho-IBCCF O , Brazil), based on international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and ethical guidelines for investigation of experimental pain in conscious animals. 29) All compounds were administered orally (0.1 ml/20 g) as a suspension in arabic gum (0.5% in saline) (vehicle) 1 h before the noxius stimulus. Indomethacin was used as standard. Results are expressed as meanϮS.E.M. of "n" animals per group and the activities expressed as percentage of inhibition when compared with the vehicle control group. The data were statistically analyzed by the Student's t test for a significance level of * pϽ0.05. When appropriated, the ED 50 values (i.e. the dose able to elicit 50% of the maximum effect observed) were determined by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software.Acetic Acid-Induced Abdominal Constriction in Mice The antinociceptive activity was determined in vivo using the mouse abdominal constriction test induced by acetic acid 0.6% (0.1 ml/10 g; i.p.). 9) Compounds and indomethacin were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. Ten minutes after i.p. injection of the acetic acid the number of constrictions per animal was recorded for 20 min. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle.Acetylcholine-Induced Abdominal Constriction in Mice Constrictions were induced by acetylcholine (4.0 mg/kg; i.p.) and the number of constrictions per animal was recorded for 10 min. 30) (Ϫ)-Spectaline, LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle.
Formalin-Induced Pain in MiceThe formalin-induced pain test was carried out as described by Hunskaar and Hole. 10) Animals were injected subplantarly with 20 ml of 2.5% formalin in hind paw. (Ϫ)-Spectaline, LASSBio-755, LASSBio-776, indomethacin were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. The time that mice spent licking or biting the injected paw or leg was recorded. Two distinct periods of intensive licking activity were identified and scored separately unless otherwise stated. The first period (earlier or neurogenic phase) was recorded 0-5 min after formalin injection and the second period (later or inflammatory phase) was recorded 15-30 min after injection.Anti-inflammatory Activity The anti-inflammatory activity was determined in vivo using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test as previously described. 9) (Ϫ)-Spectaline and indomethacin were administered at a range dose of 10-300 mmol/kg and 0.3-100 mmol/kg respectively, LASS-Bio-755 and LASSBio-776 at 100 mmol/kg. Animals were then injected subplantarly with either 0.1 ml of 1% carrageenan solution in saline (0.1 mg/paw) or sterile saline (NaCl 0.9%) into one of the hind paw, respectively. The paw volumes were measured using a glass plethysmometer coupled to a peristaltic pump, 3 h after the subplantar injection. The edema was calculated as the volume difference between the carrageenan and salinetreated paw.Hot-Plate Test Central analgesic activity was investigated using the hot plate test as described earlier. 12) In these experiments, the hot plate apparatus (Ugo Basile, Model-DS 37) was maintained at 56Ϯ1 °C. Mice were placed on the heated surface and the time between placement and the first sign of paw licking or jumping was recorded as latency. Latency was recorded at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after oral administration of vehicle, morphine (39.5 mmol/kg, used as positive control) or compounds (100 mmol/kg). The basal latencies were found to be 6-10 s. A cut-off time of 30 s was followed to prevent any injury to the paws.Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.
