DIARYLHEPTANOIDS OF CENTROLOBZUM SPECIES*'
Ahstraet-The heartwoods of two Centroiobi& species (Legumhosae) were examined. C. robustum Mart. was found to contain piceataunol, (-)-ccntrolobine (VIIa), (-)-de-O-xnethyhxntrolobiie (VIIb) and (-)centrolobol (VI). C. tomentosum Bed. was found to contain (+)-centrolobine (IXa), (+)daO-methylcentrolobine (IXb) and (+)-centrolob~l (VIII). THE TRUNK wood of Centrolobium robusturn Mart. contains the antibiotic, centrolobine.2 Its structure (Ia) is known through the work of Marini-l3etti)Io and associates,3 who synthesized the racemates of 0-methylcentrolobine (Ib)3 and of centrolobine.4 The absolute configuration of the two asymmetric centres of centrolobine, however, remained to.be established. In the quest for a sample of centrolobine, needed to accomplish this objective, the heartwood of C. robustum was re-examined. RZ (Ia) Rt=Me,Rz=H (Ib) Rt=Rs=Me (Ic) Rt = R2 = II The plant material was secured in the State of Espirito Santo.

was identified with piceatannol(3,3',4,S-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene) by direct comparison with an authentic sample. Piceatannol was isolated previously from the heartwood of Vouacapoua macropetala Aubl. and V. americana Aubl.,' other South American species of the Leguminosae.The i.r. and NMR spectra of a second substance were identical to the corresponding spectra which had been published for centrolobine. 3 Co-chromatography with a sample of centrolobine, obtained during the previous study of C. robusturn, using a number of solvents for development, led to a single spot in all cases. Nevertheless, whereas the m.ps of the old and the new isolates were identical, the mixed m.p. was considerably depressed. This fact suggested immediately examination of the optical rotation of both samples, and, indeed, the sample of centrolobine isolated in the previous study ([a]?' +97")3 gives rise, in the 600-400 nm region in MeOH solution, to a plain positive o.r.d. curve, whereas the sample isolated in the present study ) gives rise to a plain negative o.r.d. curve. The optical activity of the centrolobines is caused by two asymmetric centres, including one directly attached to an aromatic ring. An examination of the c.d. data showed that the expected Cotton effects,6 associated with the two electronic transitions in the 3W200 nm region of this aromatic chromophore, are both negative in (-)-centrolobine.Upon comparison with the analogous spectra of (-)-centrolobine, the i.r., u.v., NMR and o.r.d. curves indicated the structure of (-)-de-0-methylcentrolobine (Ic) for the third substance isolated. This proposal was confirmed by conversion of both compounds (Ia and Ic) to the common derivative (-)-0-methylcentrolobine (Ib). More interesting was the fourth compound, designated centrolobol. Its close structural relation to the centrolobines was revealed by the U.V. spectrum, practically superimposable on the analogous spectrum of Ic. The mass spectrum, however, showed the molecular ion peak at two more mass units than would be expected for de-0-methylcentrolobine (Ic), and the facile loss of a water molecule. This suggested the structural derivation of centrolobol by hydrogenolytic opening of the pyran-ring of the centrolobine system. Indeed, i.r. as well as NMR evidence, obtained on centrolobol triacetate, pointed to the presence of one alcoholic and two phenolic hydroxyls in centrolobol itself. The aromatic region of this NMR spectrum contained signals related to two symmetrical AA"BB" systems. The signals of the aliphatic region were attributed to two benzylic and four unconjugated methylenes, besides one carbinolic proton. The structural moieties (IIa, b, c) which became evident through this analysis could be linked in three different ways. The symmetrical alternative (IIIa) cannot represent the optically active centrolobol ([algo -WY).A compound of structure IIIb should be easily dehydrated. Formation of the styryl chromophore was, however, not observed when a benzene solution of centrolobol was heated under reflux with p-toluenesulfonic acid.   (IVa) Ra = Me, R2 = H (IVb) R, = R2 = Me (IVc) R1 = R2 = HThe asymmetry of centrolobol is caused by the substituents of the secondary carbinol: two flexible chains which differ by two methylenes. Its absolute configuration could, consequently, be derived by comparison with analogous compounds, the correlation of whose molecular rotation and absolute configuration had been established by Brewster.' According to this treatment, an alcohol of absolute configuration (V), in which M -n = 2, should have the molecular rotation of -24 which characterizes (-)-centrolobo1. The definition of the compound as 3%1,7-di-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-heptan-3-01 (Newman formulation VI) followed.H-&+3,),-R 6H (v)The absolute configuration of (-)-centrolobine (Ia) could now be deduced. The spatial arrangement of the substituents at C-6 cannot suffer alteration during hydrogenolysis to (-)-O-methylcentrolobol (IVa), and thus it clearly also occurs in the S-configuration. Marini-Bettblo et al. already stated that the two a-hydrogens of the pyran ring of (+)-centrolobine (Ia) are probably in the axial conformation. The arguments presented in favour of this deduction were the appearance of the corresponding NMR signals at relatively low field,' and the synthesis of (&centrolobine.For reasons of stability, it was assumed that the acid catalysed etherifkation of 1 ,%dihydroxy-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1 -(4-methoxyphenyl~heptane should lead to a bisequatorially substituted pyran derivative.' The authors did not use the arguments based on magnitude of coupling constants which are usually employed for the assignment of conformation to protons on a cyclic system. The signal due to the proton at C-6 is not sufficiently resolved at 60 MI-Ix to allow the direct determination of these constants. A dramatic improvement of this situation is apparent upon inspection of the 220 MHz spectrum (Fig. 1). The multiplets due to the protons at C-2 and C-6 clearly show that these protons have an axial conformation. This is particularly evident in the pair of doublets which represent H-2 (T J-70, Ju-= 105 Hz, J,,,, = 2-O Hz) and may be inferred from the pattern width of 25 Hz for the signal due to H-6 (7 6.56). This width is in accord with the summation of one axial-axial coupling, one axial-equatorial coupling and two vicinal couplings to the or of the specimen which we used to give (-)-centrolobine. The questions, whether different stereoisomers are produced by different varieties, different geographical forms, or even if one of the two specimens was incorrectly classified as C. robusturn, must, at present, be considered unsolved. However this may be, the configurational identity of C-6 in (-)-centrolobine (VIIa) and (-)-de-O-methylcentrolobine (VIIb) and of C-3 in (-jcentrolobol (VI) extracted from our specimen of C. robusturn suggested the biosynthetic interconnexion of these compounds. It was anticipated on these grounds that in specimens which produce (+)-centrolobine as the most abundant metabolite, dextrorotatory companion substances should occur. We were fortunate to be able to demonstrate the correctness of this prediction analysing C. tomentosum  ,,l,,,,,.,,,l1,,,,,,,,l,,,,,,,.,i,,,,.,,,,I,,,,,.,,,I ,.. l,,,,,.,,.l.,11,,.,,l,.,...1.',,,,,,.,,,1,,,.,,,,,1~ Benth. from the Rio Dote region of the State of Espirito Santo. The ethanol extract of its heartwood yielded (+)-centrolobine, (+)-de-O-methylcentrolobine and (+)-centrolobol. The NMR data for (+)-centrolobine were identical in all details, including the coupling constants of the two doublets which represent the proton at C-2 and the pattern width of the C-6 proton signal, with the analogous data for (-)-centrolobine. The structure of ZS-(p-methoxyphenyl)-6R-[@(phydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-tetrahydropyran (IXa) was consequently assigned to (+)-centrolobine, while 3R-1,7di-(phydroxyphenyl)-heptan-3-01 (VIII) was considered to represent (+)centrolobol.The centrolobines and di-(phydroxycinnamoyl)-methane, constituent of Curcumu longa L. (family Zingiberaceae), '* have identical carbon skeletons and aromatic oxygenation patterns. The biosynthesis of this and other curcuminoids seems to involve coupling of 2 'O K. R. SIWNW, J. Pharm. Pharmad. 5,448 (1953). cinnamate units with the carbon atom of a precursor of unknown nature. This hypothesis was extrapolated to the biosynthesis of centrolobine. 3 Alternatively, chain extension of 1 cinnamate unit by 5 acetate units could also represent a possible route to the natural diarylheptanoids.

R3 = OH, RI = Rz = H Centrolobol must thus correspond to 111~. Indeed, only a 3-heptanol should be derivable through the.hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether linkage of a centrolobine. Hydrogenation of (-)-centrolobine (Ia) in presence of a Pd/C catalyst was carried out, and afforded the expected (-)-O-methylcentrolobol (IVa). Conversion of this derivative to (-)-di-O-methylcentrolobol (IVb), equally accessible from (-)-centrolobol (IVc = 111~) itself, was achieved by diazomethane methylation.
