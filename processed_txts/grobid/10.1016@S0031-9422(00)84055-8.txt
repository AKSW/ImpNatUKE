The seeds of Virola sebifera Aubl. were found to contain, besides the previously reported l,ll-diarylundecan-l-one and Caryltetralone neolignans [2], the cis-dibenzylbutyrolactone lignan, 1. In the pericarp, however, two equally novel trans-dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans (2a, 2b) were found to accompany (-)-hinokinine (2~). The IR carbonyl absorptions (v,, 1773 + 6 cm-') ofall four isolates suggested the presence of a butyrolactone system. Indeed, as 13C NMR evidence (Table 1) suggests by comparison with the known derivative 2c [3], all compounds must be 2,3-dibenzylbutyrolactones. The nature of the substituents at C-2 and C-3 can be determined by mass spectrometry [4] (Table 2). According to Corrie et al. [S], relative configurations in 2,3-dibenzylbutyrolactones are given by NMR comparison of the methylene protons at C-4. Equivalence of these protons corresponds to the cis-configuration, while nonequivalence corresponds to the trans-configuration. In this respect, 1 as well as the model compound 3 [S, 61, must be cis-oriented, while Za-2c as well as the model compound 2d [4] must be trans-oriented (Table 3). Finally the opposite ORD curves for the cis-derivative 1 (C91476 -m CdJl:'ocI -2700), and the model compound  2c and2d [6].  I 2a R'-R'=CH,, R'=Me 2b R'=R'=Me 2C R'-R'=R'-R'=CH, 2d R'=Me, R2-R2=CHz
EXPERIMENTALIsolation ofconstituents. Fractionation ofa seed extract [2] was carried out by dry CC. The column was cut into 33 portions. Portions 15-23, purified by repeated TLC, gave a major constituent (2.1 g [2]). Elution of one of the remaining bands on the plate gave 1 (35 mg). An additional quantity of fruits was collected from a specimen growing near Cajuru, %o Paulo State, by Hipolito F. Paulino Filho, UNESP, Araraquara. The seeds were removed and the pericarp was dried, reduced to powder (1 kg) and extracted with C&H, at room temp. The solvent was evaporated and the residue (31 g) crystallized from MeOH to give acylglycerols (10 g). The mother liquor was evaporated and the residue (21 g) submitted to dry CC (400 g Si gel, CHCl,-EtOAc, 19: 1). The column was cut into three equal portions which were extracted with MeOH. Evaporation of the solns gave three residues corresponding to the lower (L), the middle (M) and the top (T) portions of the column. The residue L (7.1 g) was, in part (1.6 g), separated by TLC (Si gel, CHCI,-EtOAc, 9: 1) into 2a (130 mg) and 2c (120 mg). The residue M (6.8 g),. chromatographed on a Si gel column, gave 2b (300 mg); besides other products which, as also the residue T (5.5 g), were not further examined.(2R, 3s) -3-(3,4_Dimethoxybenzyl) -2-(3,4+nethylenedioxybenzyf)-butyrolactone (1).

Abstract-A new biflavonoid, semecarpuflavanone, has been isolated from the nut shells of Semecarpus anacardium. Its structure has been assigned on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence. Two new compounds 4 and 5, besides the three known shells of Semecarpus anacardium L. The structure of 4 has biflavanones [l] 1-3, have been isolated from the acetone already been assigned[2]. The present study deals with soluble fraction of an ethanolic extract of the defatted nut the structural determination of 5.
