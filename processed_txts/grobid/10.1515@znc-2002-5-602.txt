New Spirorotenoids from Tephrosia candida
Tephrosia candida, Fabaceae, SpirorotenoidsThe ethyl acetate extract of roots of Tephrosia candida afforded three new spirorotenoids belonging to a new class of spirocompounds, named tephrospirolactone, tephrospiroketone I, and tephrospiroketone II. The structures of these compounds were determined mainly based on spectral analysis. The only known spirorotenoid described in the literature is amorphispironone, isolated from Amorpha fruticosa.

IntroductionThe genus Tephrosia belongs to the family Fabaceae, which is well-known to be a rich source of flavonoids, besides the rotenoids among their secondary metabolites. Rotenoids, an interesting class of compounds showing mainly activity against insects, have also shown powerful ictiotoxic activity, fish poison. Rotenone was the first rotenoid identified and had been used as insecticide before the advent of the organosynthetic insecticides (Jacobson, 1971). Recently, properties as anticarcinogenic activities have also been attributed to rotenoids. Tephrosin and amorphispironone (1) isolated from Amorpha species have shown a potential use against tumours including skin cancer (Konoshima et al., 1993 andLi et al., 1993).We have been interested in the chemistry of T. candida and have described the isolation of rotenoids from this plant (Andrei et al., 1997 andPereira et al.,1998). In continuation of the study of the roots of T. candida we now describe the isolation and identification of three spirorotenoids, which represent a new spiroclass system formed by the rings B and C, a different spiro system type of amorphispironone, the only known spirorotenoid (Li et al.,1991).

Plant materialRoots of T. candida (Roxb.) DC were collected and identified in the Instituto Agrono ˆmico do Parana ´, PR, Brazil, January 1988. Voucher specimens are deposited at the Herba ´rio of Instituto Agrono ˆmico, Londrina, PR, Brazil.
Extraction and isolation of compoundsThe roots were dried in an open stove at 60 ∞C and powdered affording 2.7 kg. Exhaustive extraction with ethyl acetate after hexane extraction, gave 36.5 g of crude extract (dry weight). A part of the ethyl acetate extract (8.0 g) was submitted to droplet countercurrent chromatography (DCCC) using an ascending system obtained from the mixture of the following solvents hexane:CHCl 3 :CH 3 CN (10:3:7 v/v/v). A fraction (2275 mg) was submitted to column chromatography (70Ð230 mesh) eluted with hexane and ethyl acetate with increasing polarity. Purification of the fractions with silica gel columns (230Ð400 mesh), preparative tlc on silica eluted with hexane:CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH (50:49:1 v/v/v) and recycling preparative HPLC on silica gel using as eluent a mixture hexane:CH 2 Cl 2 :i-PrOH (80:10:1 v/v/v) afforded tephrospirolactone (2) (7.3 mg), tephrospiroketone I (3) (5.2 mg) and tephrospiroketone II (4) (1.2 mg).Tephrospirolactone (2): [α] 25 D +9.5∞ (4.5 mg/ml Ð CH 2 Cl 2 ).

Results and DiscussionThe infrared spectra showed absorption of carbonyls at 1681, 1748 and 1675 cm Ð1 , and 1716 cm Ð1 for 2 and 3 respectively. The absorption 1748 cm Ð1 was attributed to a carbonyl of an α,β-dihydro-δlactone ring and the one 1716 cm Ð1 to the α,βdehydro-cyclopentanone, while absorptions close to 1680 cm Ð1 , are usually observed for carbonyls of 6a, 12a-dihydrorotenoidsThe 1 H NMR of the three compounds displayed an AB coupling system for two geminal hydrogens, neighbouring the quaternary carbon of the Table I. 1 H NMR data for spirocompounds (CDCl 3 , 400 MHz). Rotenone (Birch et al., 1985) and deguelin (Andrei et al.,1997)  spirorings (Table I). This system has never been observed before for any rotenoids. Other signals showed to be characteristic of hydrogens in the rings A, D and E, exhibiting differences of the chemical shifts, in comparison with deguelin (5) (Andrei et al. 1997) and rotenone (6) (Birch et al. 1985) as models. The chemical shifts observed for H-1 and H-4 in the ring A (Table I) exhibited accentuated differences indicating the presence of an electron withdrawing substituent at the aromatic system. The hydrogens in the D and E rings showed closer chemical shifts when compared with those of the above deguelin and rotenone. The pair of doublets attributed to H-6 in the spirocompounds showed similar chemical shifts with those of the homoisoflavanone scillascillin ( 7). The diastereotopic protons of this compound (H-2) appear as an AB system, displayed at δ 4.52 and 4.62 (J = 11.0 Hz) (Heller and Tamm, 1981).The 13 C NMR chemical shifts were attributed to the carbons of compounds 1, 2 and 3, having rotenone (6) (Crombie et al., 1975) and deguelin (5) (Andrei et al.,1997) as models (Table II). The chemical shifts of C-6a and the additional carbonyl in C-12a of the new compounds have never been described for common rotenoid skeleta before. The data of Table II are in agreement with the proposed structures.When compared with the model compounds the main differences observed were: deshielding of C-3 and C-4a (∆δ ~8 ppm), suggesting the addi- tional withdrawing effect of the conjugated carbonyl at C-12a; C-6 is deshielded (∆δ ~5 ppm) due to β-effect of the quaternary carbon (6a); C-7a of the spiroketones showed deshielding of 9 ppm due to their presence in a five membered ring; the spirolactone with a six member ring showed a shielding for C-11a (∆δ = 6.1 ppm) that can be explained by the electron donor effect of the lactone oxygen to C-12 and the chemical shifts for C-7a , C-8, C-9 and C-10 of spiroketones are deshielded in comparison with the models, while C-11 are shielded of 4 ppm in both cases.The HMBC spectrum of tephrospirolactone (2)(Table III) showed cross peaks between hydrogens and carbons ( 2 J and 3 J) that confirmed the proposed structure. The main correlation was observed between C-6a and the diasterotopic hydrogens at C-6.EI/MS also corroborated the structures proposed for the spirocompounds. The spectrum showed two possibilities of a retro Diels-Alder rearrangement. The base peak for 2, could be explained by a retro Diels-Alder between C and D rings, followed by a common loss of a methyl Table II. 13 C NMR data* for spirorotenoids (CDCl 3 , 100 MHz). Rotenone (Crombie et al., 1975) and deguelin (Andrei et al., 1997) , 1984 andCrombie andWhitting, 1998). These two last reviews show the main biosynthetic pathways. The biosynthetic pathway for amorphispironone 1, isolated from Amorpha fruticosa (Li et al., 1991;Terada et al.,1993) was discussed by Li (1991), and also mentioned by Crombie (1998). For the spiroketones 3 and 4, a similar first step mechanism with an epoxidation, like in amorphispironone, can be suggested. Therefore, the starting compound should be the 6a,12a-dehydrodeguelin. The epoxidation should occur between C-6a and C-12a. In a hydrate form at C-12 carbonyl, a pinacol-pinacolone type rearrangement could lead to the spiro compounds, after interconversion to the carbonylated form and oxidation of C-12a into a keto group. Subsequent oxidation by a Baeyer-Villiger reaction type at C-12 and expansion to a six membered lactone ring could explain the formation of the spirolactone 2.Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.
