20_EPIHEYNEANINE, AN IBOGA ALKALOID FROM PESCHIERA AFFXNIS
20-Epiheynenine, an epimer of the known iboga alkaloid heyneanine, is the major base of the root bark of Peschiera afinis. It is accompanied by lesser quantities of coronaridine, coronaridine pseudoindoxyl, affinisine and olivacine, as well as sitosterol, fi-amyrin, lupeol and 3-0-acetyllupeol.

INTRODUCI-IONAntitumor [l] and spasmolytic [2] properties of a crude extract and the major alkaloid [3] from the root bark of Peschiera a&is (Muell. Arg.) Mikrs (= Tabernaemontana c&is Muell. Arg., Apocynaceae Plumieroideae) were reported. The fractionation of this extract has now led to the terpenoids sitosterol, fl-amyrin, lupeol and 3-O-acetyllupeol, besides the alkaloids coronaridine [4], coronaridine pseudoindoxyl, whose natural occurr-was anticipated [S], afIinisine [6] and olivacine [7]. The major alkaloid was characterized as 2O-epiheyneanine (lb).(lalR=Mc,

RESULTSThe molecular formula Cz1H,,N,03, determined by high resolution MS, the qualitative composition of the low resolution MS Fable 1) and the UV of the major alkaloid were registered previously for heyneanine (20-hydroxycoronaridine) [89]. The mp, however, was depressed upon admixture of an authentic sample, kindly supplied by Dr. S. M. Kupchan, and the IR spectra, though very similar, were not superimposable. The sole significant difference of the 'HMR spectra (Table 2) referred to the frequencies due to the protons of the side chain. This is locked in a tixed conformation by the intramolecular hydrogen bridge, whose existence was ascertained through the invariance of the IR 3470 cm-' band upon dilution in CHC13. Thus the substituents at C-20 are exposed to two possible environments, according to their con&nation.The C&-20 MR signal of heyneanine and the H-20 signal of the novel isolate appear upfield relative to the corresponding signals of the respective epimers. These substituents (R in 1) may thus be located in the anisotropically protected region above the ring systems, as tentatively proposed in the formulae la for heyneanine and lb for epiheyneanine.Mp's, as well as UV, IR, 'HMR and MS, of four additional alkaloids were identical with lit. data for coronaridine [4,10], coronaridine pseudoindoxyl [S], afTi& sine [6,11] and olivacine [7,12]. The identification of coronaridine was confirmed by saponification of the base with KOH followed by decarboxylation in HCl to iboga-, mine [4], compared with an authentic sample kindly supplied by Dr. E. Wenkert. The identification of affinisine and of olivacine was confirmed by direct comparison with authentic samples kindly supplied, respectively, by Dr. M. P. Cava and Dr. C. W. Mosher.
DISCUSRIONThe major alkaloids of P. afinis are, according to previous work [6,11], of the vobasine (vobasine and ffiine) and the sarpagine (a@nisine) types. In contrast, P. lundii @. C.) Miers from Port0 Seguro, Bahia, Bras& contains substantial amounts of iboga alkaloids, as well as olivatine, usually associated with the genera Taberwmnantunu, Tubernunrhe and Voaeangu; only trace amounts of vobasine and no sarpagine type alkaloids were isolated. Thus, it appeared to the authors [S] that P. lundii might be better viewed as a Tabernaemontana species than as a species of Peschieru. The present reinvestigation of P. a&is, however, again revealed the presence of iboga alkaloids (20_epiheyneanine, coronaridine, coronaridine pseudoindoxyl) and olivacine in the genus Peschiera, and confirmed the presence of afhnisine. This seems to suggest that the indicated chemical differences are of little systematic significance. It should, neverthelesq not be forgotten that the close botanical relationship between these two genera has often led to confusion and either generic name has been assigned to a species, according to a botanist's individual preferences [5].Furthermore, the previous study on P. afinis [11] employed an EtOH extract of the "whole plant" in which our root bark constituents could have played a relatively minor role and escaped detection. Both analyses refer to specimens collected in north-eastern Brazil. This origin eliminates doubts about correctness of identifications of the plant material. P. a&is is one of the more frequent and characteristic shrubs of the sandy plateaus around Fortaleza and no other species of these two genera is known to grow in Ceara State. The identification was based on studies by Adolf0 Ducke [13], and confirmed by Dr. C. M. Barroso (Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden) and Dr. J. Monachino (New York Botanical Garden).  mp 194-197" (lit.
