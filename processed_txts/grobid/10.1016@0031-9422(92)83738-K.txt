QUINOLONE ALKALOIDS FROM ZANZ-BOXYLUM ACUTIFOLIUIW*
The leaves of Zanthoxylum acutfolium afforded five new quinolone alkaloids which were identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis as acutifolin, acutifolidin, 0-methylacutifolin, acutifolin pahnitate and neoacutifolin. In addition, the known compounds (E, E)-N-(2-methylpropyl)-2Ptetradecadienamide, (E)-3,4-dimethoxycirmnamic acid and /%sitosterol were also isolated and characterized.

~anthoxyium ~~t~~liurn Engl. (syn. Fagata ac~t~~~~~~ is a small tree of the tropical forests of Minas Gerais State (Lagoa Santa) and Slo Paulo State [l]. As part of a continuing study of the chemistry of Zanthoxylum [23, we have examined the leaves of this previously uninvestigated species.
RFSUX,TS AND IWXXJSSIDNThe dichlo~methane and methanol extracts of the leaves of 2. ~~~~~~~~ on chromatography over silica gel and preparative TLC, afforded five new quinolone alkaloids, ~u~olin (I), acutifo~din (2}, O-methylacutifolin (3), acutifolin palmitate (4), and neoacutifolin (5), in addition to the known compounds (E, Q-N-(2methylpropyl)-2,4_tetradecadienamide, (E)-3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid and fi-sitosterol. The known compounds were identified by comparison with published data [3-61.Acutifol~ (1) exhibited similar spectral data to lunacridine {6), which has previously been isolated from Lunusia amuru and L. c&data (Rutaceae) [7, 81. The 'HNMR spectrum (Tabie i), instead of signals for an isopropyl moiety, showed two broad 1H singlets for an exomethylene (6 5.06,4.83) and a broad singlet for a viny& methy (6 1.86). These signals and the mass spectral fragm~t at m/z 232 [M -C,H,O] + required the presence of exomethylene at C-3' of the sidechain of hmacridine. This was supported by the i3C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which agreed closely with published data for l-demethyl-8-demethoxyacutifolin    2) spectral data are consistent with 2 being an ~-dem~hylacutifolin derivative. The alkaloid 3 also showed the spectral characteristics of an acutifolin derivative, except for the presence of an aliphatic methoxy group @3.16,56.2, Tables t and2). The mass spectrum gave a base peak at m/z 85 (C5M90) which indicated a methoxyl at C-2' of the sidechain. The new alkaloid is, therefore, U-methylacutifol~.Compound 4, was also found to be an acutifolin derivative, with the IH and 13CNMR spectra (Tables 1  Table 1.

The 'H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and2), in addition to signals typical of a dihydrofuroquinolin-4one, revealed the presence of an isopropenyl system. The mass spectrum showed peak for loss of C,H, from the [Ml+ ion (m/z 230) which pointed to an isopropenyl group attached to the dihydrofuran ring on C-2', confirming that neoacutifolin has structure 5.The range of albaloids found in 2. acutifolium is typical of the Rutaceae [7]. Murray [9] has pointed out that coumarin production is generally highest around the time of flowering. The leaves of Z. acutzfolium were collected in December, before the flowering and fruiting season. This appears to explain the absence of coumarins in this species.EXPERIMENTAL NMR: CDCI, with TMS as int. standard; MS: 70 eV, direct probe insert and elevated temp.Plant material: Aerial parts of Zanthoxylum acutifolium were collected from the Jatai Reserve, Slo Paulo, Brazil (Dec. 1987) and a voucher is deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de Biociincias, Universidade de Sgo Paulo, SHo Paulo, SP.Extraction and isolation of compounds l-5. The leaves (190 g) of Z. acutifolium were dried and extracted with CH,Cl, and MeOH. The CH,Cl, extract (5.3 g) was subjected to VLC over silica gel eluting with hexane, hexane-CH,Cl,(1: 1), CH,Cl,, CH,Cl,-Me,CO (19: l), Me,CO and MeOH to give 7 frs, three of which were rechromatographed as above. Frs 5 and 6 gave 1 (52 mg), 2 (8 mg), 4 (19 mg), 5 (8 me) and (E)-3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid (4 mg). Fr. 4 was then purified by prep. TLC on silica gel using CHCl,-Me,CO (49:1), to afford (E&)-N-(2methylpropyl)-2,4-tetradecadienamide (29 mg) and /3-sitosterol (30mg). The MeOH extract (23.7 g, used only lO.Og) was subjected to VLC over silica gel eluting with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc to gve a polar fr. which was purified by prep.
