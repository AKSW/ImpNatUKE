SONDERIANIN, A FURANOID DITERPENE FROM CROTON SONDERIANUS
From the heartwood of Croton sonderianus was isolated a new furanoid diterpene, sonderianin. The structure was elucidated by spectral analysis, X-ray studies and chemical evidence.

INTRODUCTIONThe benzene extract of the heartwood of Croton sondeiianus Muell. Arg. has been shown to have specific activity against
Mycobacterium smegmatisand Staphylococcus aureus (J. D. McChesney and L. A. Mitscher, unpublished results). From this extract was isolated a novel diterpene, sonderianin (l), bearing the backbone-rearranged clerodane-type carbon skeleton.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The molecular formula of sonderianin (l), CziH,,O,, was determined by high resolution MS [M+' obs. 358.1756 (12"/,), talc. 358.17731. The IR spectrum revealed the presence of carbonyl groups (y-lactone, 1760cm-i and x,/l-unsaturated ester, 1710cm-I), one double bond (1645cm-i) and one /3-substituted furan system (1515 and 880cm-') [1,2].The 'H NMR spectrum in CDCl, (270 MHz) showed signals for three furan protons (6 7.45, H-15; 7.43, H-16; 6.40, H-14), one olefinic proton (6 6.53, H-3), one tertiary methyl (6 1.46, Me-18), one secondary methyl (6 1.02, Me-17), one methoxy group (63.70, MeOCO-19) and one -CHzCHOCO system (6 2.40,CH,. The other assignments for the additional proton signals and their correlations were determined by extensive decoupling experiments (Table 1). The i3C NMR spectrum (Table 1) allowed the assignments of two quaternary carbons, three CH, five CH,, and confirmed the presence of two methyl groups.The occurrence of a mono-/I-substituted furan moiety, an a&unsaturated ester, a y-lactone and a secondary methyl and analysis of analogous diterpene structures in the literature [1,3-61 made it possible to propose a clerodane-type diterpene structure (1).The multiplet at 6 1.48 (H-8) ('H NMR spectrum) changed to a pair of doublets (J = 4,10 Hz) on irradiation * Instituto de Ciencias Exatas, Universidade Rural do Rio de Janeiro, 23.460~Seroptdica-RJ, Brazil.t Instituto de Fisica e Quimica de SLo Carlos. Universidade de Sgo Paulo, 13.560~SZo Carlos-SP, Brazil.of the methyl at 1.02 (Me-17). These J values indicated that the H-8 is axial. The signal at 1.59 appeared as a pair of doublets (J = 4, 10Hz) and revealed that the H-10 is axial.The structure proposed for sonderianin (1) was confirmed by ' 3C NMR analysis. Table 1 lists the carbon shifts, assigned by comparative analysis of the protonnoise decoupled and single-frequency off-resonance decoupled spectra, by standard chemical shift theory and comparison with the data reported for other furanoid diterpenes with the clerodane skeleton [l, 3-61.Catalytic hydrogenation of 1 gave a neutral crystalline hexahydro derivative (mp 169-171") and an acid octahydrosonderianin, the latter formed by catalytic hydrogenolysis of a y-lactone allylically situated to a furan ring, a reaction well documented in the literature [7,8]. In both derivatives, the 'H NMR spectrum showed the disappearance of the bands at 6 7. 45, 7.43, 6.40, 6.53 and 5.40, assigned to the furan, oxymethine and olefinic protons respectively. In their place appeared a fourprotonmultiplet centred at 3.80. In addition the 'H NMR of the octahydro derivative presented a broad signal at 10.80 interchangeable by addition of D,O.Unequivocal proof of the structure and relative configuration of sonderianin (1) was achieved by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The colourless crystals of 1 have the space group P2,2,2, with a = 7.314, b = 10.481 and c = 24.276A. Independent data were obtained for 2098 planes of which 955 had F > 3a(F) and were used in the refinement. Intensities were measured using graphite monochromaticCuKcc radiation. The structure was solved by the MULTAN method.
