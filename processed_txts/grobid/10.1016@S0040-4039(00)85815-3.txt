In order to establish the complete connectivity of the molecular framework of velloziolone and to confirm the lD-n.m.r. results , a two-dimensional study was undertaken on (1) as described by Freeman lb .The two-dimensional spectrum was recorded on the sample used in the lD-INADEQUATE experiment , at 60°C in order to shorten spin-lattice relaxation times.  6 The6via double quantum coherence , the structural determination of VELLOZIOLONE (1) , a new diterpene , has been carried out. During the course of a continuing phytochemical survey of Brazilian Velloziaceae , we have examined a sample of Vellozia caput-adeae L.B. Smith & Ayensu , a species occuring in Diamantina , State of Minas Gerais , Brazil , from which a new diterpene , velloziolone (1) was isolated.With the help of 'INADEQUATE' n.m.r. experiments 1 we establish herein its structure.To our knowledge , this example is the first application of the two-83 , CHC13) , was determined by microanalysis and by mass spectrometry [m/e 304.2377 (M+')] .Its 100 MHz 'H n.m.r. spectrum (CDC13) showed the folloing clearly resolved signals : three methyl singlets at 0.75 , 0.92 and 1.15 ppm and two olefinic protons at 4.92 and 5.02 ppm.Based on conventional carbon-13 n.m.r. data (Table) , on the results given above and on the structure of other compounds isolated from Vellozia species 2 , two different seco-ent-kauren-16-eno structures (1) and (2) were considered as a working hypothesis for the new diterpene. Carbon-13 n.m.r. spectral analysis of velloziolone was first attempted at 50.31 MHz with a Bruker WM-200 spectrometer.The double quantum pulse sequence was used la-This allowed the detection of carbon-carbon coupling constants at natural abundance with suppression of the strong signals from molecules with a single carbon-13 nucleus.Although , a number of matching satellite pairs were identified from this experiment , the structure of velloziolone (1) could not be es- tablished.Ambiguities were due to the close chemical shift of some resonances (Table) and especially to coupled nuclei forming strong AB systems with reduced satellite intensities 3 .Therefore , the spectral study was attempted again at 100.62 MHz with a Bruker WM-400 spectrometer. A solution of velloziolone (1) was prepared in dioxan-d8 [850 mg of (1) in 1 ml solvent] .As a preliminary experiment , first an APT-type spectrum was measured 4.This defines the multiplicit;, bound protons) for each carbon signal and allows the determination of the maximum number of carbon connectivities possible for each carbon atom.Then , the double quantum pulse sequence was optimized for 'JCC = 44 Hz (Jr = l/4) in order to observe coupling constants for both sp3-sp3 and sp*-sp3 type linkages with the maximum intensity in one experiment.Data was accumulated at 95°C overnight using a recycle time of 4.33 sec.The number of data points was 16K with a frequency range of 6040 Hz giving a digital resolution of 0.75 Hz/point.Resolution enhancement with the Gaussian multiplication technique was applied 5. Analysis of the results permitted to recognize 17 one-bond and 1 two-bond matching satellite pairs (Table and Figure).Although , this lD-INADEQUATE experiment suggested structure (1) for velloziolone , 5 one-bond coupling constants (J8 g , J,, g , J13 16 , J15 16 and J16 ,7) were missing from the spectrum based on formula (i).A choice betwien struciures (1) and'(*) was extremely simple with the help of this powerful new n.m.r. technique.For instance the latter structure would imply the 73.69 ppm carbon signal to be coupled with three methylene type carbon resonances.However , inspection of the spectral data indicates clearly that the neighbours of the 73.69 ppm carbon signal are a methine , a methylene and a methyl type resonance , in agreement with structure (1). Missing satellites were due to carbon atoms involved in bonds with each of the two carbon atoms C-9 and C-16 , expected to have especially long relaxation times.It has been shown previously that couplings to carbons exhibiting long T, values were suppressed or have given strongly reduced satellites in intensity if the recycle time used was too short 2b,6 .However, unambiguous evidence was afforded for the connectivity between C-8/C-9 and C-9/C-11 by the detection of the two-bond coupling constant J8 ,, (Table).Such coupling constants (*Jcc) through a ketone have been shown to be of the &der of 9 -12 Hz in cyclohexanone systems . lD-INADEQUATE spectral analysis of terpenic molecules at high magnetic field is often very difficult.Complications are due to the similarity of most coupling constants and to the rather important isotope shifts.Furthermore , the coupling carbon pairs display AX or only weak AB systems.

The digital resolution in this 2D-study was insufficient to determine precise coupling Constants-The latter (Table and Figure) result from the lD-INADEQUATE experiment described above.It is worth noting that the low values of the coupling constants (Table) corresponding to J8,14 and J11,12 reflect the o< , P position of these linkages with respect to the C-9 6 ketone.Such an effect has been demonstrated previously on cyclohexanone systems . This investigation illustrates the advantages of high magnetic field for structural studies based on natural abundance 13c _ 13 C coupling constants.The study could be completed in spite of the unfavourable dispersion of the carbon signals , five of which appear in (1) within 1.46 ppm in the 42 -44 ppm region.
