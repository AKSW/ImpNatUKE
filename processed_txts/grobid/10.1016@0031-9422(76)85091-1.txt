STRUCTURE AND ABSOLUTE CONFIGURATION OF THE SESQUITERPENOID EMMOTINS*
The trunk wood of Emmutum nitens (Icacinaceae) contains the aromatic sesquiterpenes (2R,3S)-2-hydroxy-3-(2'-hydroxyisopropyl)-5,8-dimethyl-l-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthale @mot&F), 2-hydroxy-3-(2'hydroxyisopropyl)-5,8-dimethylnaphthalene (emmotin-G) and 3-(i'-hydroxyisopropyl)-5,8-dimethyl-l,2-naphthoquinone (emmotin-H). The identity of the carbon skeletons of these emmotins was proved by conversion of all three into an identical quinoxaline derivative. The nature of this skeleton and the absolute configuration of emmotin-F, as well as of the previously described emmotins A and B, was established by conversion of emmotin-F into (+ )-occidol.
Rl2WL.l-S AND DISCUSSIONEmmtum nitens (Benth.) Miers, an arboreous Icacinaceae species, has a wide geographical distribution. A trunk wood sample from a specimen growing in the vicinity of Diamantina, Minas Gerais, contained two sesquiterpenoid tetralins, designated emmotin-A (la) and -B (lb), and two sesquiterpenoid naphthalenes, designated emmotin-C (2) and -D (3). Their structural proposals were based mainly on PMR evidence, and, consequently, only the relative configurations for C-2 and C-3 of emmotin-A and -B were established. Allocation of the substituents to C-5, based on 13C NMR evidence in the case of emmotin-A and -B, was considered a reasonable postulate also for emmotin-C and -D in the light of a probable biogenetic relationship [ 11.The chemical investigation of another trunk wood sample, collected from a specimen growing in the Linhares Reserve, Rio Dote, Espirito Santo, where the species is known as "faia", revealed three different wmpounds. Elemental analysis and MS MW determination indicated their formulae to be CI,HzOO, (emmotin-F, lc), C15H1sOa (emmotin-G, 4a) and C15H1603 (emmotin-H, 5).Formation of a diacetate (Id) upon Ac@-C,HSN acetylation at reflux temp and of a trio1 on NaE%H4 reduo ' 43 (56). A soln of -l&a (IW mg) in EtQH (10 mt) was reffuxed (7 hr) with 5% KOH in EtOH (15 ml). Standard work-up

tion assigned the three oxygens of emmotin-F to two OH and one CO functions. The CO function must be substituted by a benzene ring and one of the carbinols. Evidence for conjugation with the benzene ring are UV (k,, 259 nm, E 11200) and IR (vmax 1680 cm-') spectra, as well as ease of catalytic hydrogenolysis of emmotin-F to a diol (6a). Evidence for vicinality with a CHOH group was found in the formation of a red oquinone (7) upon dehydrogenation of emmotin-F with Pd-C in refluxing xylene. Functionality and structural features of 7 were established by derivatization with o-phenylenediamine to a quinoxaline, CZIH1sN1 (8). An isopropenyl group (z 7.47, t, J 1.5 Hz [3H] and 4.53, q, J 1. 5 Hz [2H]) is present in this compound (8), as well as in a derivative (9) obtained by heating emmotin-F or its diacetate (Id) in TsOH-Ac,O, and shows the additional carbinol of emmotin-F to be part of a hydroxypropyl unit.
?&;& Hofi These facts, in conjunction with the interpretation of the PMR spectrum, which was very similar to those ofemmotin-A (la) and -3 (1h) (Table l), led to the tentative classification of emmotin-F as the tetralone emmotin lc. Both emmotin-A diacetate (le) El] and emmotin-F diacetate (ld) were d~~toxyIat~ on reduction with Zn. The derivative (lOa), submitted suceessivefy to catalytic hydro~nolysis and ~~~~tion* gave (+)-occidol (#lb), characterized by mp, opticaf rotation [2] and direct UV, IR and PMR spectral comparison with a sample of synthetic (k)-occidol kindly supplied by Dr. Y. Hirose, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Tokyo, Japan. This correlation es~b~h~ not only the carbon skeleton and 3~o~guration, but also the 2R-configuration of emmotin-F, in view of the traptsdiaxiai relationship of H-2 and H-3, evidenced by PMR data (Table 1).The ORD curve of emmotin-F is su~r~~~b~e on those given by emmotins A (la) and B (lb), compounds in which the substituent~ at C-2 and C-3 also are trms. Ah three tetralone emmotins, thus, possess identical absolute configurations. The constitution and absolute configuration of the previously mentioned dial can now be confidently formulated as 6a. The racemates of 6a and lob were prepared during a synthesis of (A)-rishi-tin01 (6b) [3]. The published data on these products, however, are insuf%cient to validate comparisons with our ~rn~un~.If it is admitted, as a working h~~~~ that the carbon skeleton of emmotin-F prevails in emmotin-G and -Ii, only the respective formulae 431 and 5 can represent these ~m~unds.Indeed, ~otin-G is a   naphthol (&,,, 243 nm, e 53900; a?" 254 nm, e 55xX))with a pair of o-related protons (r 2.82 and 2.92, doublets, J 8 Hz) and a pair of p-related per&protons (z 2.27 and 2.58, singlets); and emmotin-H is an ortho-naphthoquinone (&, 265 nm, E 40800; Y,, 1649 cm-'; intense red colour slowly di~~ged by addition of aq. Na,S,O, to a CHQ ~lu~o~) with a pair of o-related protons (7 2.64 and 2.87, doublets, J 8 Hz) and a single periproton (z 2.14, singlet).As expected acetylation of e~ut~-G (to 4b) caused a strong ~r~gneti~ shift {A 0.59 ppm) of the H-l singlet, and oxidation with Fremy's salt at room temperature yielded emmotin-H (9. Attempted direct a~tyla~on of 5 under a variety of conditions led to mixtures. in contradistinction, either reductive acetylation in presence of zinc or acetylation of the quinoxabne derivative 12 gave good yields of isopropenyt compounds, 13 and 8 respectively. Since the dehydra~on product 8 is equally avaitable from emmotin-F the initial hypothesis is correct. and also the emmotins G and H must possess the carbon skeleton of occidol @lb).The 3S~o~~a~on of the emmotins is typical of the natural eudesmane type sesquiterpenes. This fact suggests their biogenetic relationship with this class of cornpounds. It is, cons~u~dy, proposed that their biosynthesis, by analogy with that of occidol [4], should involve a one carbon shift by a dienol-benzene rearrangement of an eudesmane type precursor.
