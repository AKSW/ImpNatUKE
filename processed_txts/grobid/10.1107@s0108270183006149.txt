Introduction.The title compound is one of the components of the extract from the heartwood of Cyclobium claussene Benth., a tree originating from the region of Pedro Leopoldo, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The main component of its benzenic extract is an orange pigment that was named claussequinone in view of its quinonic character. The proton NMR and mass spectroscopy analysis of this compound disclosed its isoflavanquinonic skeleton and pattern of substituents. ORD studies of this compound and of a synthetic compound allowed the determination of the configuration shown in Fig. 1 (Gottlieb, Oliveira, Gonqalves, Oliveira & Pereira, 1975). This X-ray diffraction study was carried out to elucidate the precise molecular conformation of the heterocyclic ring, and to look for any hydrogen bond present in the crystalline structure.
Experimental.Red-orange single crystals, tetragonalpyramidal habit, obtained by slow evaporation of ethanol-chloroform solution, single-crystal dimension about 0.4 mm. Cell dimensions from setting angles of 25 high-angle reflections, CAD-4 automatic diffractometer, room temperature, 0 < 70 °, 0--20 scan mode, graphite-monochromatized Cu Ka radiation, Lp corrections, absorption and extinction corrections ignored. 1537 measured unique reflexions, 1237 observed [F2> 2tr(F2)]; structure solved by direct methods (Germain, Main & Woolfson, 1971)  where w= [a(Fo) 2 + (0.05Fo)2] -1 for observed and w = 0 for unobserved reflexions, until all the atomic-parameter shifts were smaller than their standard deviations. The final unweighted R factor, omitting unobserved reflexions, was 0.064 (including them 0.067).* Anisotropic temperature factors were assigned to all non-hydrogen atoms. Neutral complex scattering factors were used (International Tables for X-ray Crystallography, 1974). Final positional parameters for the H atoms were calculated assuming a C-H bond length of 1.0 A and the expected geometry, with isotropic temperature factors assumed to be 6.0 A 2.Discussion. Table 1 gives the atomic parameters for the C and O atoms. The atomic notation, and interatomic distances and bond angles are shown in Fig. 2. There are no unusual bond lengths in the structure. The bond distances and angles in the chroman ring agree well with those found in two adducts of 4-(phydroxyphenyl)-2,2,4-trimethylchroman with ethanol and chloroform (Flippen, Karle & Karle, 1970). The benzene and the quinone rings are planar [average distances of atoms from the planes are 0.011 (4) and 0.019 (8)A respectively[ and the dihedral angle between the best least-squares plane through these rings is 26.9 °. A distorted half-chair conformation of the dihydropyran ring can be observed from the deviations of the atoms 0(4), C(2), C(3) and C(4) from the best least-squares plane through the benzene ring [0.027 (3), 0.439 (4), --0.350 (3) and 0.052 (4) A respectively[ and from the torsion angle of the bond O(4)-C(2)-C(3)-C(4), 66.1 °. The quinone ring is linked to the chroman ring by C(3) in an equatorial position. Table 2 shows some torsion angles to characterize the conformation of the molecule.The packing of the molecules, shown in Fig. 3, is stabilized by a system of hydrogen bonds which generates a helical arrangement along the c axis.
