LIMONOIDS FROM TRICHILIA HIRTA
Fromthe fruits and leaves of Trichilia hirta were isolated, besides sitosterol and sitostenone, two novel limonoids: methyl 11~-acetoxy-6-hydroxy-l2cc-(2-methylpropionyloxy)-3,7-dioxo-1,5,14,20,22-meliacapentaen-29oate and methyl 1 1~-acetoxy-6,23-dihydroxy-l2a-(2-methylpropionyloxy)-3,7,2l-trioxo-1,5,14,20-meliacatetraen-29oate. Three known protolimonoids, melianone, melianodiol and bourjotinolone A were also isolated. The limonoids and protolimonoids occurred only in the fruits, and sitostenone only in the leaves. Sitosterol occurred in both fruits and leaves. All structures were established from spectral data.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION POThe dichloromethane extract from fruits of T. hirta, afforded two new limonoids, methyl lib-acetoxy-6-hydroxy-12u-(2-methylpropionyloxy)-3,7-dioxo-1,5, 14,20,22-meliacapentaen-29-oate (3) and its 23-y-hydroxybutenolide derivative (4) besides three known protolimonoids melianone (5) melianodiol (6) bourjotinolone A (7) and sitosterol. The IR spectrum of the hmonoid 3 presented characteristic absorptions for hydroxyl (3390 cm-'), ester carbonyl (1740 cm-'), and cc&nonsaturated ketonic carbonyl (1680 cm-') groups. The mass spectrum showed a parent peak at m/z 594, which toeether with 'H and '%NMR data allowed us to pripose the following elementary formula C,,H,,O,e for 3. The 'HNMR (Table 1) showed characteristic signals of a /I-substituted furan moiety (67.29, 7.13 and 6.21). Furthermore, the presence of olefinic protons conjugated to a carbonyl (6 7.09 and 6.11, J = 10 Hz), corresponded to H-l and H-2, respectively. The 'H NMR still showed the existence of four tertiary methyl groups characterized by the singlets (6 1.72, 1.66, 1.50 and 1.01). The presence of only four signals corresponding to methyl groups suggested that one of the five methyls commonly found in the hmonoids [2] should be oxidized     4. Finally, structure 3 was proposed for this limonoid. The complete attribution of all chemical shifts for the carbons in ' 3C NMR is found in the Table 2. Cedrelone (8) [3] was used as a model compound.Compound 4 was very closely related to 3. Its IR spectrum was essentially superimposable on that of 3, suggesting the same functional groups in the latter. The mass spectrum showed the parent peak m/z 626, which when compared with 3, indicated the presence of two more oxygen atoms in 4. Therefore, the combination of this data with those obtained from 13CNMR (Table 2) suggested the elementary formula C,,H,,O,,.The analysis of the 'H NMR (Table l), revealed that the difference between compounds 3 and 4 was only in the furan ring. For compound 4 instead of a furan unit, there is a y-hydroxybutirolactone attached to C-17. This unit was confirmed by 'HNMR (66.17 s) attributed to H-23, and by the diacetate 4a obtained when 4 was acetylated; the 'H NMR of 4a showed two extra peaks (62.16 and 2.08). One of these signals is attributed to the diosphenol acetate unit, the other to the OAc-23, where the acetylcarbinolic proton showed a signal (66.82). Comparison of the 13C MMR of 4 with nimocinolide [lo] showed clearly that this compound has a 23-y-hydroxybutenolide moiety (6136.4, 169.8, 145.6 and 96.3) attributed to C-20 and C-23, respectively. The same argument can be used to rule out the possibility that 4 is the isomer corresponding to isonimocinolide [l 11. Based on the above evidence we proposed structure 4 for this limonoid.The three protolimonoids were also identified from their spectral data by comparison with the known compounds melianone (5), melianodiol (6) [12] and bourjotinolone A (7) [13]. Melianone and bourjotinolone A occurred as a mixture, which was separated only after acetylation.The limonoids we have isolated are slightly different from those isolated by Taylor [ 1); however, they are very typical compounds from the Meliaceae [14]. EXPERIMENTAL General. NMR spectra were run at 25" using a 5 mm 'H or 13C probe with observations frequencies of200 and 50 MHz, respectively. NOESY: shift correlations were performed using the pulse sequence [S]; D1-9O"-D@90"-D9-90"-FID; pulse with 'H (90") = 6.1 psec; proton relaxation delay (Dl) = 3 set; length of delay D9 =0.4 set; number of experiments NE = 512; number of scans NS = 120. lH-13C COSY long-range correlation: shift correlation sequence [8, 91; proton relaxation delay (D1)=3 set; D3 and D4 values (0.071 set and 0.036 set respectively) were calculated using the observed three-bond coupling constant, 'Jc-= 7 Hz. In both expts, 40 mg of 3 were dissolved in 0.5 ml of CDCl,, containing TMS as int. standard.Isolation of constituents. T. hirta was collected in Espirito Santo, Brazil, and a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of Institute de Bioci&ncias USP, Sao Paula. The CH,CI, extract from fruits (11.82 g) was chromatographed on silica gel eluting with CH,CI,-EtOAc (9: 1). The column yielded 10 frs which were rechromatographed in small columns affording pure compounds. Fr. 4, gave 3 (43 mg), fr. 5,4 (23 mg) and sitosterol(6 mg). Fr. 7 afforded bourjotinolone A (5 mg) and melianone (6 mg). Fr. 8 gave melianodiol (89 mg), bourjotinolone A (10 mg) and melianone (8 mg). Fr. 9 yielded melianodiol(66 mg), bourjotinolone A (6 mg) and melianone (5 mg). Frs containing bourjotinol-one and melianone, were first acetylated and the corresponding acetates sepd by TLC. A petrol extract from leaves (9.09 g) using the same procedure yielded sitosterol (158 mg) and sitostenone (65 mg).Limonoid 3. Yellowish viscous oil. IR v,__ cm-': 3390, 1740, 1680, 1637, 902.

Ho5pYdouble bond (C-l/C-2) was reduced The reduced compound did not show the typical doublets for H-l and H-2 in the 'H NMR. The r3C NMR obtained for 3 (Table2), fl showed 32 signals, of which 10 corresponded to C-sp2. The presence of an epoxide group as occurs in cedrelone [3] and hirtin Cl], was ruled out due to the absence of signals between 669.8 and 55.1. On the other hand, one presence of a 4/I-carbomethoxy group at C-4 OH was deduced from 'H NMR. Furthermore, a very strong correlation between the carbomethoxy group and the C-. Several correlations were confirmed by NOE @ difference spectroscopy through irradiation at Me-19, Me-28, CO,Me and OAc signals frequencies, respectively. A different relative configuration based mainly on the chemical shift of C-4 methyl has been proposed for 0 45 hirtin [S], a limonoid very closely related to 3. The 6 stereochemistry suggested for C-9, C-13 and C-17 is based on the biosynthesis of limonoids [6]. However, for \E" C-11 and C-12 the small coupling constants between H-11 and H-12 (J=4.7 Hz), and between H-l 1 and H-9 4 0 (J = 5.1 Hz) requires a trans-relationship for these pro-0 OH tons [7]. This attribution was confirmed by 'HP'H, 'H-'3CCOSY experiments [S]. The assignment of the 22' stereochemistry and relative positioning of the acetoxy @ and isobutiroxy groups was possible by NOESY experiments (Table 3). A strong correlation between the carbomethoxy and acetyl groups showed their cis relationship. This also determined the position C-11 for the 0 %, acetoxy group. From several 2D-experiments it was 7 possible to attribute the chemical shifts for all protons and carbons in the molecule. From long range carbon
