Abstract-TheMyristicaceae must be added to the small number of families which contain isoflavonoids; the previously unknown 5,7,2'-trihydroxyq-methoxyisoflavone and 5,7-dihydroxy-2',4'-dimethoxyisoflavone having been found to co-occur with biochanin A in btrola caducfolia W. Rodr.In contrast to the near ubiquitous occurrence in higher plants of other flavonoids, isoflavonoids are confined very largely to the Leguminosae.To the small list of other families in which they occasionally occur [2], the Myristicaceae must now be added. We have located isoflavones and even pterocarpans in several species [3] and are of the opinion that isoflavonoids constitute a general, rather than a sporadic, characteristic of this family. The present report is concerned with Krola caducifolia W. Rodr.  Their practically identical UV spectra suggested that both are 5,7-dihydroxy (AlC13 and NaOAc shifts) isoflavones with identical oxygenation pattern. Indeed CHzNz methylation of lb and of lc gave the same partially etherified derivative, Id.The presence of OH-5 (7 -2.7 + 0.1, s) and of H-2 in lbd (7 2.0 k 0.2, s) was evidenced by the PMR spectra. Additional features concerned the meta split doublets due to H-6 and H-8, partially superimposed on the signals due to H-3' and H-5'. The substitution of ring B can, nevertheless, be diagnosed, since a one proton ortho split doublet (J 9.  j,,H,20,requires: 300.06341. ;:EH (nm): 221. 263. 290 (log E 4.26. 4.37,4.06); &'~"+NaOR (nm): 235. 273. 327 (log E 4.27, 4.30, 4.01); i&H+lu"o"c (nm): 225. 275. 336 (log E 4.26. 4.35. 3.76): $'~"' "('I1 (nm): 221, 275. 378 (log E 4.30. 4.38. 3.08): $f; (cm-I): 3260, 1665, 1618, 1585, 1570. 1509, 1330, 1280. 1265, 1191.

0 Hz) at relatively low field (t 2.78 k 0.02) clearly indicates the existence of H-6' and its relation to other protons at C-3' and 5'. Position 2' must, consequently, be substituted, and by an OH in lb [MS: M-17 (23%), M-31 (Ox)] and an OMe in lc [MS: M-17 (2x), M-31 (24x)]. The structures of 5,7,2'-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone (lb) and 5,7-dihydroxyy2',4'-dimethoxyisoflavone (lc), which are indicated by these data, are further supported by appropriate retro-Diels+Alder MS peaks. According to a recent survey [Z], the oxygenation pattern of lb and lc has so far been observed only in the case of two complex isoflavones: parvisoflavones A and B [8]. No simple 5,7,2',4'-tetraoxy-isoflavone derivative has been isolated previously. This is surprising due to the reasonable frequency of occurrence of biochanin A [Z], its putative precursor. of trunk wood (10 kg) was extd with CsH,. The ext (60 g) was chromatographed on a SiO, column, giving, in order, the following fractions with the indicated eluants: A (petrol), B (petrol-C6H,, l:l), C and D (C,H,), E (CHCl,), F (MeOH). A was composed of fatty oil. B was tryst from C,H,-MeOH giving virolane (1.7 g). C was sitosterol (2 g). D was recryst from CHCI, giving virolanol (63 mg). E was tryst from CHCl,. The crystals were washed with MeOH to pure lc (1.5 g). The washings were separated by repeated Si02 chromatography into la (120mg) and lb (130mg). The identification of virolane [S], R. BKAZ F'. et al. virolanol [S], biochanin A [9] and sitosterol relied on direct comparison with authentic samples.
