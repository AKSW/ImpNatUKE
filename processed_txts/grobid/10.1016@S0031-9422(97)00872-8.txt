Further examination of the seeds of Toona ciliata led to the isolation of two new norlimonoids which were identi_ed on the basis of spectroscopic analysis as 4a\5b\7a!trihydroxy!17!norisotoonafolin and 4a\5b\7a\01a!tetrahydroxy!17!norisotoonafolin[ In addition\ the known limonoids cedrelone and toonacilin and the sterols sitosterol\ stigmasterol\ campesterol and 2b!O!b!D!glucopyranosylsitosterol were also isolated and characterised[ These results show that Toona has a less pronounced relationship to the Swietenioideae[

INTRODUCTIONToona di}ers from other genera of Swietenioideae\ notably by the absence of limonoids of the mex! icanolide group ð0Ł[ Recently\ we have described the isolation and identi_cation of two novel limonoids\ 01!deacetoxytoonacilin and 5a!acetoxy!03b\04b! epoxyazadirone from the dichloromethane extract from the seeds of Toona ciliata ð1Ł[ Limonoids with an intact carbon skeleton and the B!seco are features that are largely con_ned to the Melioideae ð0Ł[ Thus\ Toona appears to have a less pronounced relationship to the former [ We have now examined the hexane and methanol extracts of T[ ciliata[ The methanol extract a}orded two new pentanortriterpenoids\ 4a\5b\7a!trihydroxy! 17!norisotoonafolin "0# and 4a\5b\7a\01a!tetrah! ydroxy!17!norisotoonafolin "1#[
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe hexane extract from the seeds of T[ ciliata gave a mixture of sterols and two limonoids\ which were identi_ed by comparison with published data as ced! relone ð0Ł and toonacilin ð1Ł[ The mixture of sterols was analysed by GC mass spectrometry\ which established that the sterols were sitosterol\ stigmasterol and cam! pesterol [ A methanol!soluble fraction of the methanol extract was puri_ed by repeated column chro!
