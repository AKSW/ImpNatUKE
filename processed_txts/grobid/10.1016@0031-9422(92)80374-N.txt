ISOLATION OF SECOISOLARICIRESINOL DIESTERS FROM STEMS OF SIMABA CUNEATA
A mixture of secoisolariciresinol lignans acylated at C-9 and C-9' with dodecanoic, tetradecanoic and hexadecanoic acids, the triterpenes 3-oxo-tirucalla-7,24diene and 3,21-dioxo-tirucalla-7,2~diene, and the steroids sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, sitostenone, sti~astenone and campestenone were isolated from the stems of Simaba cuneuta. Their structures were established based on full spectral analysis and chemical methods.

I~RODU~ONMany species of the genus Samba Aubl. have been shown to contain quassinoids [l]. An investigation of the stems of the previously uninvestigated S. ctlneata St. Hil. (Tull) which grows in S&o Paulo state, Brazil, has led to the isolation of two triterpenes based on tirucallane, six steroids and a mixture of lignans acylated with fatty acids. GC-mass spectral analysis and interpretation of '"CNMR data showed that the fatty acids had nonbranched chains. This appears to be the first record of fatty acid esters of lignans from the Simaroubaceae or from the allied families of the order Rutales [2]. Secoisolariciresinol diesters have also been isolated from Saluia plebeia (Labia&) [3].ciresinol have only been reported from Saivia plebeia (Labiatae).The initial fractions of the chromatographic analysis yielded large amounts of a solid which was rechromatographed affording two triterpenes 3-oxo-tirucalla-7,24diene and 3,21-dioxo-tirucalla_7,24_diene [7, S] and six steroids: sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, sitostenone, stigmastenone and campestenone [3,4]. The fraction containing hydroxy steroids was acylated with acetic anhydride in pyridine prior to analysis. The latter fraction and fraction containing keto steroids were identified by GC-mass spectrometry and comparison with published spectral data [S].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe major compounds investigated in this study were identitied as a mixture of lignans acylated with long-chain saturated fatty acids (1) which yielded secoisolariciresinol (2) [3,4] upon hydrolysis. The acids were esterified with diazomethane and identified as dodecanoate, tetradecanoate and hexadecanoate methyl esters by GC-mass spectral analysis and compa~son with publish~ data
I33 2115The most common tetracyclic triterpenes in Simaroubaceae are tirucalla-7-ene derivatives which arc the precursors of quassinoids, compounds that are major chemotaxonomic characters of the family [ 11. However, this represents the first report of 1,4-diarylbutane-type lignans from this family. Indeed lignans do not seem to be common in Simaroubaceae. As the distribution of lignans is, to date, restricted to the two rutalean families Rutaceae and Burseraceae, this report would appear to reinforce that Simaroubaceae has strong affinities with the other rutalean families.The identification of the acids as nonbranched fatty acids was also supported by the 'jCNMR spectrum (Table 1) which showed a signal at 6 13.9 for a methyl group indicting the absence of a y-gauche effect as occurs on the terminal methyl group in 3-methyl~ntane  Coupling constant in parenthesis.EXPERIMENTAL General.

Simaba cuneata was collected in Brazil by Josi R. Pirani (Departamento de Botinica, Universidade de SHo Paulo, S.P.). A voucher specimen (SPF 38208) is deposited at the Herbarium of the Departamento de Botlnica, Universidade de Sb Paulo, S.P. The stems (734 g) were dried, powdered, and extracted with hexane for over a week.Separation and identijcation of compounds. The hexane extract of the stems (3.679 g) was chromatrographed over silica gel using a gradient of hexane_EtOAc as eluent. Crystallization from hexane of the fr. eluted with hexane-EtOAc (24: 1) yielded 3-0x0tirucalla-7,24-diene (410 mg). Continued elution of the column with hexane-EtOAc (19: 1) yielded, after crystallization, a mixture of the ketone steroids sitostenone, stigmastenone and campestenone (93 mg), the triterpene 3,21-dioxo-tirucalla-7,24diene (48 mg), and the 3-hydroxy-steroids sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol (121 mg). Prep. TLC (hexaneXH,CI,-Me&O, 3:16:1) of the fr. eluted with hexane-EtOAc (17:l) yielded the lignans diesters (28 mg) as a single spot on TLC using several different eluents.Lignans diesters.

The mixture of diesters (7 mg) was refluxed for 1.4 hr in a soln of 1 M NaOH (15 ml) and MeOH (10 ml). The soln was acidified and extracted with CHCI,. The products were sepd by CC. The acids were esterified with CH,N, in the usual way. [6]. The mass spectra gave significant fragments for m/z 43 [C,H,]+ and 57 [C,H9JC as well as successive loss of m/z 14 [CH,] requiring the presence of nonbranched fatty acids. These observations suggested that this group of natural products belongs to ihe secoisolariciresinol series and that C-9 and C-9' have been acylated by dodecanoic, tetradecanoic and hexadecanoic acids. All these compounds appear to be novel.
