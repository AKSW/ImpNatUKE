COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ZOANTHID STEROLS, THE GENUS PALYTHOA (HEXACORALLIA, ZOANTHIDEA)*
The sterol composition of three Palythoa species has been analysed and compared with literature data.2. The mixture of sterols known as "palysterol" has been observed in all our samples suggesting that palysterol might be considered as a fingerprint of Palythoa species.3. The sterols of Palythoa caribaeorum did not show marked geographic, seasonal or sex variations and its zooxanthella showed about the same sterol composition as the host symbiont association.4. Biological implications are discussed.

INTRODUCTIONChemical studies of zoanthids have dealt principally with palytoxin (Moore & Bartolini, 1981), zoanthoxanthins (Prota, 1980;Chevolot, 1981) and mycosporins (Hirata et al., 1979). In comparison, very little attention has been payed to zoanthid sterols (Goad, 1978).Pioneer in zoanthid sterol chemistry, Bergmann (1949) isolated "palysterol" from the caribbean Palythoa mammilosa. Based on molecular rotation studies, palysterol has been first believed to be the C-20 epimer of 7-sitosterol (I) (Bergmann et al., 1951), than to be a new sterol of unknown structure (Bergmann, 1962). Later Gupta & Scheuer (1969) isolated the sterol fraction of P. tuberculosa from Eniwetok and showed it to be identical to Bergmann's palysterol. Analytical gas chromatography (GLC) proved the presence of five sterols which were separated by preparative GLC and identified as cholesterol (II), brassicasterol (III), 22,23-dihydrobrassicasterol (IV), fl-sitosterol (V) and gorgosterol (VI). From an unidentified Palythoa collected near Okinawa island, Kanazawa et al. (1977) also isolated sterols II, III, 1V and VI co-occurring with chalinasterol (VII), small amounts of cholesta-5,22(E)-dien-3fl-ol (VIII) and traces of the very peculiar 23, . With this exception, the latter sterol is found only in octocorals (Kanazawa et al., 1977;Kelecom et al., 1980) and is supposed to be an intermediate in the biosynthesis of gorgosterol (VI) (Ling et al., 1970). Contrasting with the aforementioned results, another unidentified Palythoa from Tahiti furnished only chalinasterol (VII) (Gupta & Scheuer, 1969). * Part X of the series: Studies of Brazilian Marine Invertebrates.As a part of our general screening on marine invertebrates from the Brazilian coast, we became interested in zoanthid sterols. In the two previous papers of this series (Kelecom, 1981;Kelecom & Sol6-Cava, 1981), we studied the sterol composition of two species from the Zoanthus genus. We now report on the sterol composition of some Brazilian Palythoa species. In one case, the sterols of the associated alga have also been analysed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
EquipmentIn addition to the equipment described previously (Kelecom, 1981), we used for centrifugation of the associated zooxanthellae a Heraeus-Christ Minifuge 2 instrument operating at 15°C.
AnimalsThree Palythoa species were collected on rocky bottom, along the Brazilian coast. Palythoa caribaeorum were obtained from various locations, at different periods of the year and also as sterile, male, female and hermaphrodite colonies. For convenience, samples have been distinguished by their collection number. Animals were then sun-dried or stored over 70"/o aqueous ethanol until examination. Data about the collection appear in Table l. The associated alga have been obtained keeping the freshly collected Palythoa caribaeorum (sample CF-72) for 3 days at 45-5WC. An abundant mucus is produced which revealed, under microscopic examination, to be extremely rich in intact zooxanthellae. The mucus suspended in saline water has been filtered over a 100/~m sieve. Repetitive suspension of the filtrate in saline water followed by centrifugation yielded a zooxanthella fraction practically not contaminated by zoanthid cellular detritus. The host was freeze-dried before extraction.  
ExtractionAnimals stored over 70% ethanol were extracted as described earlier (Kelecom, 1981). Dried animals were exhaustively extracted with methylene chloride. The yield in methylene chloride solubles appear in Table 1.
Obtention of the sterolsObtention of the sterol mixtures and isolation of the sterols as their steryl acetates by argentic silica gel column chromatography have been carried out by previously described techniques (Kelecom, 1981;Kelecom & Sol&Cava, 1981). As crystallizations of the sterol mixtures altered the relative proportions of the sterols, sterol mixtures for GLC comparative analysis have been crystallized only once. -46.7 ° (Bergmann et al., 1951)~ MS of the mixture: molecular ions at m/e 426 (6, C30H500), 412 (1, C29H4sO), 400 (57, C28H,,sO), 398 (9, C28H460) and 386 (14, C27H460), characteristic fragment ions at rn/e = 385 (15, 400 -CH3), 383 (8,382 (22,380 (1,371 (3,368 (8,, 367 (14, 400 -CH3, HzO), 365 (2, 398 -CH3, H20), 355 (3), 353 (4, 386 -CH 3, H/O), 339 (3), 336 (4), 328 (3), 315 ( 22), 314 (14, MacLafferty rearrangement from a A 24128) double bond and/or cleavage of the cyclopropane ring of gorgosterol), 300 (11), 289 (22), 273 (18), 271 (18), 255 (27), 213 (26) .... ; GLC: see Table 2.Identical physico chemical data have been recorded for the other sterol mixtures and will not be repeated here.From P. caribaeorum sample CF-72, we obtained by argentic silica gel column chromatography sterols III, VII, VIII and X as the acetates, all of them over 90~o pure by GLC. Physico chemical data have been found essentially identical to reported data (Sheikh & Djerassi, 1974). Sterols II, IV and VI were obtained no better than 75% pure.
RESULTSBiological identification of our collection appeared to be a delicate task. First, there is no available sys-tematic biological study of Brazilian zoanthids. Second, the sole strictly South American zoanthid, Palythoa braziliensis Heider, 1895, had his holotype lost (Pax & Miiller, 1957, p. 22) and could not be identified as none of our specimens due to the incomplete original description. Finally, systematics of zoanthids is rather confused at species level (Walsh, 1967). Based on gorgonian (Bayer, 1961) and porifera distributions (Sol6-Cava et al., 1981), it can be assumed that the lower invertebrate marine fauna of the Brazilian tropical region can be best compared with the West Indies one. Consequently, final identifications of our specimens came from their comparison with zoanthids reported for the West Indies.Sterol mixtures obtained from male or sterile colonies of Palythoa caribaeorum (except CF-72) have been found by m.p., [~], MS and GLC practically identical to each other and also to the sterol mixture known as palysterol (Bergmann et al., 1951 ;Gupta & Scheuer, 1969) (see Table 2). The only differences were the absence of the trace sterol fl-sitosterol (V) (no molecular ion at m/e = 414) and the presence in some of our samples of minute amounts of sterols with relative retention times (RRT) to cholesterol of 0.70 and 1.97.The sterols of RRT of 1.00~1.13 and 2.09 have been identified by co-chromatography with authentic samples of cholesterol (II), brassicasterol (III) and gorgosterol (VI). Sterol of RRT 1.27 (molecular ion at m/e --400) has been identified as 22,23-dihydrobrassicasterol (IV) on the basis of its RRT identical with literature data obtained in the same operating conditions (Popov et al., 1976) and by analogy with reported data for palysterol (Gupta & Scheuer, 1969). The sterols of RRT 1,50 and 1.97 could not be identified, by our techniques, due to their too low concentrations in the total sterol mixture.Female or hermaphrodite colonies of P. caribaeorum (sample A-001) showed slightly higher concentration of gorgosterol (VI) than observed for male colonies, which may reflect some sex or geographic variations; however for all P. caribaeorum samples but CF-72, no important sex, geographic or seasonal variations have been detected (see Table 2). The sterol mixtures isolated from P. caribaeorum sample CF-72 and from the unidentified Palythoa species (sample G-12) have been found quite similar, particularly in the high concentration of brassicasterol (III) and the low one of 22,23-dihydrobrassicasterol (IV). The former animal was poor in symbiotic algae and the latter had been collected in deeper waters (see Table 1). The higher concentration in brassicasterol together with the lower one in derivative IV might thus reflect either low amounts of associated algae or reduced photosynthetic activity. Both animals also yielded lower amounts of extractable organic material (Table 1). On the contrary, the yield in organic matter isolated from the zooxanthella of sample CF-72 was four times that from the host (Table 1). The sterol mixture obtained from the isolated alga appeared very similar to that of the host-symbiont association, but the concentration of gorgosterol is double in the alga as compared to the host. This will be discussed further.Finally, the GLC trace of the sterol mixture from P. variabilis (A-015) also showed considerable resemblance with the one of palysterol from P. tuberculosa (Gupta & Scheuer, 1969) but with a somewhat higher concentration in sterol IV and a lower one in sterol VI.The sterol fraction of sample CF-72 was the only one obtained in sufficient amounts to allow examination of trace sterols. Acetylation of this sterol mixture, in usual conditions, followed by argentic silica gel column chromatography afforded the steryl acetates of dominant sterols II, III, IV and VI, and, in addition, the acetyl derivatives of chalinasterol (VII), cholesta-5,22(E)-dien-3fl-ol (VIII) and 24-nor-cholesta-5,22(E)-dien-3fl-ol (X), identified by their physicochemical properties identical to published data (Sheikh & Djerassi, 1974). Sterols VII and VIII had already been reported by Kanazawa et al. (1977) for an unidentified Palythoa species; sterol X had never been reported as a zoanthid sterol, however being found in many marine organisms (Goad, 1978).
DISCUSSIONAs it has been observed for the genus Zoanthus (Kelecom & Sol6-Cava, 1981) and for Antozoans in general (Kanazawa et al., 1977), Cz8-sterols are also the major sterols of the genus Palythoa. However, contrasting with the results obtained for Zoanthus species, the sterol composition of Palythoa species appeared much more uniform. Considering the dominant sterols, one may conclude that Palythoa variabilis and Palythoa caribaeorum (except sample CF-72 commented separately) elaborate a mixture of sterols practically identical to that of P. tuberculosa reported by Gupta & Scheuer (1969). All along this discussion, we shall use the name palysterol for this sterol mixture.Palysterol has also been reported for the Jamaican P. marnmilosa (Silberberg, cited by Ciereszko & Karns, 1973, p. 189) and for the Pacific zoanthids P. psammophilia and P. vestitus (Quinn et al., 1974). Remarkably, the latter species was formerly known as Zoanthus vestitus (Verrill, 1928) and has been recently reclassified as Palythoa vestitus on the basis of biological considerations (Walsh & Bowers, 1971). Hence, albeit a small number of zoanthid species have been investigated up to now, all colonies of the genus Palythoa seem to produce the same sterol mixture (at least for what concerns the major sterols). In addition, the specimens of P. caribaeorum did not show marked sex, seasonal or geographic variations. Similarly, no geographic variations had been observed by Gupta & Scheuer (1969) for the sterol mixture of P. tuberculosa. It is thus tempting to consider palysterol as a fingerprint for zoanthids of the genus Palythoa. Indeed, from the more than 80 marine invertebrates screened in our laboratory (among them sea stars, holothurians, sponges and gorgonians), only the sterol mixtures obtained from animals of the Palythoa genus presented the GLC trace of palysterol. On the contrary, no species of the closely related genus Zoanthus contained palysterol, since gorgosterol has never been found in this genus (Kelecom & Sol6-Cava, 1981).However, an unidentified Tahitian Palythoa species (Gupta & Scheuer, 1969) and the Hawaiian P. toxica (Quinn et al., 1974) have been reported to contain essentially a single sterol, chalinasterol (VII). This is in apparent contradiction with our assumption that palysterol might be a fingerprint of the genus Palythoa. As there seem to be no doubt about the biological identifications of both specimens, these observations may be in agreement with the suspicion that the genus Palythoa might well be comprised of two different genera or sub-genera (Quinn et al., 1974). The question raises then whether the presence of palysterol can be used to divide the genus Palythoa into two groups, in the same way as the presence ot cholesterol characterises the division of red algae into the sub-classes Bangiophycidae and Florideophycidae (Brothers & Dickson, 1980). Since palysterol did not show sex, seasonal or geographic dependence and since palysterol is neither related to the liberae (i.e. digitated) vs immersae (i.e. incrusted) shape of the colony nor to the presence of palytoxin, known to be associated with female colonies (Kimura et al., 1972;Kelecom et al., 1982) (Table 3), it seems that the presence of palysterol might well be suitable to distinguish both genera or sub-genera comprised into Palythoa.Since many marine invertebrates are known to be unable to biosynthetise sterols de novo (Goad, 1978), the problem merges to know whether zoanthid sterols are from exogenous origin or not. Indeed, zoanthids contain large amounts of intracellular dinoflagellate algae named zooxanthellae. The role of these algae is still not well understood, but it is known that zooxanthellae furnish nutritive organic material to the host (Muscatine, 1973). It is thus reasonable to question about the algal origin of palysterol. But if palysterol was strictly from algal origin, one should expect the various palysterol producing Palythoa species to be associated to identical or very similar zooxanthellae. This seems not to be the fact since two samples of P. rnammilosa collected from two locations around Bermudas have been shown to be associated with two different strains of zooxanthellae (isoenzyme studies) and that the similarity coefficient between both strains was very low (Schoenberg & Trench, 1980). The same observations have been made with two   Bergmann et al., 1951. b. Hashimoto, 1979. c. Gupta & Scheuer, 1969. d. Quinn et al., 1974. e. This work. f. Kelecom et al. 1982. samples of another zoanthid, Protopalythoa grandis (Schoenberg & Trench, 1980). Are zoanthid sterols thus strictly produced by the host, or are they from mixed (host algal) origin'? The following considerations on gorgosterol may answer this question.As pointed out before, gorgosterol is in P. caribaeorum (sample CF-72) twice as abundant in the sterol mixture isolated from the alga as compared with that from the host. The same observation had already been reported by Ciereszko et al. (1968) for gorgosterol from gorgonians. These authors concluded that the occurrence of gorgosterol in coelenterates is associated with the occurrence of zooxanthellae, and it has been shown since then that zooxanthellae-free gorgonians did not contain gorgosterol at all (Kokke et al., 1981). Recently, gorgosterol has been isolated from the cultured non-zooxanthella dinoflagellate Peridiniumfoliaceum (Withers et al., 1979), but it has never been found in a cultured zooxanthella isolated from an host known to contain gorgosterol, since cultured zooxanthellae produce principally 4~-methyl-sterols (Kokke et al., 1981). This might indicate that zooxanthellae are unable to produce gorgosterol or that a modification of the algal metabolism takes place when the zooxanthella is isolated from the host. More probably it means that gorgosterol is effectively produced by the host from an algal precursor. A candidate for precursor might be 4~-methyl-5~-gorgostanol (XI), a sterol which has been isolated from the cultured marine alga Peridinium foliaceum (Withers et al., 1979). Hence, gorgosterol should be from mixed (host-algal) origin. The same may be proposed for palysterol which contains gorgosterol as the second major sterol, but in the absence of any biosynthetic experiments envolving zoanthids, no final hypothesis can be proposed.Further experiments are needed to solve the problem of the origin of palysterol in zoanthids; but it remains that palysterol is only produced by most of the zoanthids of the genus Palythoa and that palysterol might be useful to divide the genus Palythoa into two genera or sub-genera.Fig. 1.
