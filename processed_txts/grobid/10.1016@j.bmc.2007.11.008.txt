Biomimetic synthesis of xuxuarines Ea and Eb: Structure revision of Rzedowskia bistriterpenoids
Reaction of pristimerin with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) resulted in a biomimetic-type coupling leading to xuxuarines Ea and Eb and not the previously reported Rzedowskia bistriterpenoids I and II suggesting that the structures proposed for these natural products need revision. A product obtained in this reaction by an unusual Diels-Alder addition followed by retro-Diels-Alder-type elimination was characterized as pristimerin dicyanophenalenedione. Complete 1 H, and 13 C NMR spectral assignments of xuxuarines Ea and Eb have been made by the application of 1D and 2D NMR techniques.

IntroductionThe triterpenoid quinonemethides (celastroloids) constitute a relatively small group of unsaturated and oxygenated D:A-friedo-nor-oleananes with interesting structures and a variety of biological activities. [1][2][3] A number of biscelastroloids have been recently encountered in plants of the family Celastraceae. 4 These are composed of quinonemethide and aromatic forms of nor-triterpenes derived from pristimerin (4a), tingenone (4b), and 22-hydroxytingenone (4c) and/or their congeners, joined by two ether linkages formed between the A rings of the two celastroloids, or between the A and the B rings; only exceptions being Rzedowskia bistriterpenoids I (5a) and II (5b) 5 which contain a single ether linkage between the two subunits. 4a Surprisingly, to date, there are no reported syntheses of biscelastroloids in which the two celastroloid moieties are joined by two ether linkages. In continuing our studies on reactions of celastroloids, 6 we have explored the potential of DDQmediated oxidative coupling of triterpenoid quinonemethides for biomimetic-type syntheses of biscelastro-loids, and herein we report that the reaction of pristimerin with DDQ yields xuxuarines Ea (1) and Eb (2). An unusual product obtained from this reaction was identified as pristimerin dicyanophenalenedione (3), formed probably by Diels-Alder-type addition of DDQ to pristimerin followed by retro-Diels-Alder-type elimination. Close resemblance of the spectral data of 1 and 2 with those reported for Rzedowskia bistriterpenoids I (5a) and II (5b) together with some discrepancies in the assignment of their NMR data strongly suggest that the structures proposed by Gonzalez et al. 4a for the Rzedowskia bistriterpenoids require revision.
Results and discussionTreatment of pristimerin (4a) with DDQ in dioxane at room temperature and work-up after its disappearance (TLC control) followed by chromatographic separation of the resulting mixture afforded 1-3. Compound 1 was obtained as a yellow solid that analyzed for C 60 H 78 O 9 by a combination of HRFABMS and 13 C NMR spectroscopy and indicated 22 degrees of unsaturation. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3448, 1728 and 1651 cm À1 suggesting the presence of OH, ester carbonyl, and a,b-unsaturated carbonyl groups. The 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) indicated the presence of 14 methyl singlets, two of which were due to OCH 3 groups (d 3.54 and 3.60) and one attached to an aromatic ring (d 2.74). In the low-field region, it had signals due to an aromatic proton [d 6.80 (s)] and an olefinic proton [d 6.25 (s)] of a 6-oxo-phenolic type triterpenoid system, 7 and protons of a quinonemethide system [d 6.09 (1H, d, J = 1.6 Hz), 6.24 (1H, dd, J = 6.6 and 1.6 Hz), 5.94 (1H, d, J = 6.6 Hz)]. 3a The 13 C NMR spectrum of 1 had signals due to two a,b-unsaturated carbonyls (d 187.89 and 190.22), two ester carbonyls (d 178.73 and 178.82), and fourteen aromatic/olefinic carbons. These data suggested that 1 is a dimeric celastroloid consisting of quinonemethide and 6-oxo-phenolic subunits. The presence of a D 2 O exchangeable signal at d H 5.11 and a dioxygenated carbon signal at d c 91.98 was indicative of a dimer joined by two ether linkages formed between the A rings of the two monomeric units. Oxidative coupling of quinonemethide and 6-oxo-phenolic subunits would give rise to two regioisomers (having C2 0 -O-C3-C4-O-C3 0 and C2 0 -O-C4-C3-O-C3 0 ether linkages) each with two stereoisomers. Analysis of the HMBC spectrum (Table 1) indicated the presence of a weak long-range correlation between CH 3 -23 and C-3 0 suggesting C2 0 -O-C3-C4-O-C3 0 regiochemistry for 1 which was confirmed by the proton chemical shift of CH 3 -23 0 (d 2.74), 4e,h-j and the NOE between H-6 and CH 3 -23 0 in its ROESY spectrum. The CH 3 -23 0 signals of its regioisomers (isoxuxuarines) have been reported to occur in the region d 2.48-2.52. 4g-i The foregoing suggested that 1 has the gross structure identical with xuxuarine E, 4h,j and the positive specific rotation confirmed its identity as xuxuarine Ea. 4j The molecular formula of compound 2 was determined to be C 60 H 78 O 9 . The 1 H, and 13 C NMR spectroscopic data of 2 were almost identical with those of 1 (Table 1). The [a] D value of 2 (À349.4) was found to be the opposite of that of 1 (+361.7) suggesting that 2 is identical with xuxuarine Eb and this was confirmed by comparison of 1 H and 13 C NMR data of 2 with those reported for xuxuarine Eb. 4h The regiochemical and stereochemical assignments of the dimer interface in compounds 1 and 2 were further confirmed on the basis of their 600 MHz ROESY spectra and from molecular modeling. Analyses of COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and ROESY spectra allowed the assignment of all the 1 H and 13 C signals of 1 and 2 (Table 1), some of which have not been assigned in previous studies. 4h,j Compound 3 was obtained as a red powder and its HRFABMS and 13 C NMR data suggested the molecular formula C 34 H 36 O 4 N 2 . Since DDQ is the only nitrogen containing compound that was present in the reaction mixture, it was suspected to have formed by the addition of DDQ (C 8 O 2 Cl 2 N 2 ) to pristimerin (4a) (C 30 H 40 O 4 ) followed by the elimination of C 4 H 4 O 2 Cl 2 . The 1 H NMR spectrum of 3 in the low-field region showed the absence of quinonemethide protons with their typical splitting patterns. 3a Instead, three 1H singlets were present at d 8.19, 6.87, and 6.64. The 1 H NMR spectrum also indicated the absence of the signal due to quinonemethide CH 3 -23 suggesting that it had participated in the reaction with DDQ. The 13 C NMR spectrum showed the presence of signals due to ten aromatic/olefinic carbons, two carbonyls, one ester carbonyl, and two nitrile carbons. In the HMBC spectrum, the low-field 1H singlet at d H 8.19 showed cross peaks with C-3, C-4, C-5, and one of the newly introduced quaternary carbons (C-32) placing this proton at C-23, which is indicative that oxidation of CH 3 -23 had occurred to the level of a sp 2 -hybridized methine. The additional four carbons and two nitrogens belong to a 1,2-dicyanoethylene moiety bridging C-23 and C-6 to make an aromatic ring, suggesting this product to be pristimerin dicyanophenalenedione (3). Detailed analysis of COSY, HMBC, and HSQC correlations (Fig. 1) allowed its structure elucidation and complete assignments of 1 H and 13 C NMR signals of 3.Formation of xuxuarines Ea (1) and Eb (2) from pristimerin (4a) may require the initial conversion of 4a into 6-oxo-pristimerol (6) followed by (oxidative) coupling with pristimerin. We have previously demonstrated that the oxidation of pristimerol with Nbromosuccinimide produces 6-oxo-pristimerol (6). 7 As depicted in Figure 2, it is possible that 6 could be formed from pristimerin (4a) by the addition of water to its quinonemethide system followed by oxidation with DDQ.Coupling of 4a and 6 to produce 1 and 2 with C4-O-C3 0 linkage may then occur through oxidized pristimerin (7) or oxidized 6-oxo-pristimerol (8). It is noteworthy that the intermediacy of ortho-quinones related to 8 has been implicated in the biosynthesis of xuxuarines, 4e scutidins, 4f and triscutins. 8 However, the formation of 3 during the DDQ oxidation of pristimerin (4a) suggests the possible intermediacy of 7 in the formation of 1 and 2 (Fig. 2). Although rare, Diels-Alder-type reactions between DDQ and dienes similar to that depicted in Figure 3 are known, 9 the hitherto unprecedented retro-Diels-Alder-type elimination of a molecule of O@C@(Cl)C-C(Cl)@C@O from the adduct 9 can be explained as due to the thermodynamic stability of the resulting aromatic product 3. We are continuing our studies to elucidate the mechanism of DDQ-mediated biomimetic-type reaction of pristimerin (4a) leading to the formation of 1 and 2.
Experimental
General experimental proceduresPristimerin used was isolated from Cassine balae 10 and its purity was determined to be >98% by 1 H NMR. Re-   agents and solvents for chemical reactions were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Melting points were determined on a Fisher-John's melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Optical rotations were measured with a Jasco Dip-370 polarimeter. IR spectra were for KBr disks recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR-8300 spectrometer. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving each compound (3.7 mg of 1, 4.8 mg of 2, and 3.1 mg of 3) in 0.5 mL of CDCl 3 (0.05% TMS) in a 5 mm NMR tube. 1 H and 2D NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer with a 1 H frequency of 600.13 MHz, using a Nalorac 5 mm inverse HCN Z-gradient probe. 13 C and DEPT spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer using a Bruker 5 mm dual ( 13 C/ 1 H) probe. All NMR data were acquired with over-sampling and digital filtering (decimation factor 32 for 2D, 24 for 1 H and 6 for 13 C) and processed using the Felix software package (Accelerys, Inc., San Diego, CA). 11 All 1D spectra were referenced to TMS at 0 ppm for 1 H and CDCl 3 at 77.0 ppm for 13 C. HRMS were recorded on a JEOL HX110A spectrometer. TLC and prep. TLC were performed on silica gel 60 GF 254 plates (Merck), whereas CC was carried out on silica gel type 60 (Baker).O O H 3 C OCH 3 O CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 H H H CN CN H H 3 C H H H H H C ROESY HMBC 1 H-1 H COSY
Reaction of Pristimerin with DDQDDQ (30.1 mg, 131.3 lmol) was added to a stirred solution of pristimerin (51.2 mg, 109.5 lmol) in freshly distilled dry dioxane (5.0 mL) at 25 °C. Reaction was monitored by TLC. After 6 h, TLC indicated the disappearance of pristimerin and its transformation to at least three products. EtOAc (150 mL) was then added to the reaction mixture and the organic phase washed with distilled water (6 • 100 mL), dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and evaporated under reduced pressure yielding the crude product mixture (68.2 mg). This was adsorbed onto silica gel (200 mg) and chromatographed over a column of silica gel (3.5 g) made up in hexane and eluted with hexane followed by hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc.
