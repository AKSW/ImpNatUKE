NEOLIGNANS FROM NECTANDRA
Abstrwt-Thetrunk wood of ~Vvc~ondro pu&u/a was found to contain 1.dgcranylgcranodioic acid besides five neolignans, the known vcragucnsm and the novel 'I-hydroxy-and 7-oxo-3,4.3'.4'-tetraoxy-8.8'~neolignans. all with the (8S.8'Rbabsolutc configuration. -..

The 'H NMR spectrum of 6b shows IWO signals for methykncdioxyls. one at 65.94 and one at d6.02.
