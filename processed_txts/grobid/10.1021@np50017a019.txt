From 21 different Croto?i species studied, we have selected nine to report on i n this work: C. soiideriiiitiis, C. esseqiiiboensis, C . iirggrophylloides, C. iifiiiis iniicroiiifoliiis, C . riiciijiii$oliiis, C. ?iepetiiefoliirs, C. jiicobineiisis, C. viiccins andC. zeiintiieri; in the latter species at least two varieties were detected as far as the cliemical composition is concerned. The isolated oils were analyzed by gcims with open tubular glass column coripled to a data processing system. Library search programs for identification of essential oils constituents were developed; algorithms were used for computation of chromatographic retention times (Kovat's indexes) and simplified mass spectra (msj. Confirmations were made by comparison of full ms or other spectroscopic data with that of standard samples w-henever available. Library search programs rising mass spectral data and Kovat's indexes were found to be an elficient method for identification of chemical constituents in essential oil analysis.Before 19'73 very little information was available about odoriferous flora of northeastern Brazil. At the present time over t\vo hundred essential oils from different plants are under pharmacological and chemical screening as n-ell as botanical investigation.In the Euphorbiaceae family, the genus Crototz, due to high incidence and species dispersion, contains by far the largest number of essential oil producing plants in the Brazilian northeast.This communication describes library search programs based on gas chromat,ography (gc) and mass spectrometric data developed for essential oil analysis and its application to the investigation of ten samples ext'racted from Brazilian Euphorbiaceae genus Croton ; C. argyroplzylloirles Muell.

This approach greatly improved the identification, especially for those compounds with very similar fragmentation patterns.

DISCUSSIOSKoyat's itideses culculatioiis by muss chromatography.-To calculate Iiovat's indexes. eight pi-alkanes were mixed in convenient proportions to the essential oil to be anal!-zed. The mixture u-as then injected in a gc ms equipped with an open tubular glass column and a data processing system. For comparision purposes. separated runs of ti-alkanes and the essential oil were made.Reconstructed mass chromatograms of the ti-alkanes were obtained by use of the ion m z 85 (11). The computer reconstructed gc of t,he essential oil was obtained by mas chromatography with ion m z 91, which was always present in terpenes. sesqu terpenes, their oxygenated derivatives, and aromatic compounds commonlp found in the essential oils (12). The relative intensity of ion m z 91 in these substances never fell below 30% of the base peak.Alas:; chromatography of the ions m z S5 and m, z 91 made it possible to obtain, with a single injection of the essential oil plus n-alkanes, information usually obtained with more than two injections, such as: the computer plot of the total ion current of the mixture (see fig. 1 as an example). This information is important for calculating Iiovat's indexes.  3). This ion reproduces a clear qualitative plot of the essential oil when compared with the total ion current of the same oil.The peak .?uperpo:;ition, if present, is ea.dy detected by matching t.he total ion chromatogram agaiiist reconstructed chromatograms of ions m z 85 and m z 91.Compirter progrums.-Essential oil analysis of the species related here were performed with the aid of three computer programs *IREh 1. KOTT 16, and BSKO 10 ivritten in BXSIC language.(see fig. 2 ) . --A library search program for automatic identification of unknowns based on mass spectral data using visually interpretative peaks (VIP) (14) and Kovat's indexes (13).
Journal of Katural ProductsI t uses the expression i21 for calculating an Identity Grade (IG), matching the unknown against each library entry. It also uses the arbitrary factor (IG+1) 2 for raising IG if the Kovat's index of the selected entry is within the range =+=3 of the calculated Iiovat's index for the unknown. The factor IG 2 is used for decreasing IG if the range is larger than *3.1 9 I1 2 5 S = l I z I G = -( C + Z -) { 2 } .where IG = Identity grade ( = 0 for complete mismatching and = 1 for complete Identity), which indicates how similar the mass spectrum of each library entry (reduced to VIP) is when matched against the mass spectrum of the unknown. S = ?;umber of VIPs in each matched library entry. C =Sumber of VIPs wit,h same m z in both the unknown and the library I1 and I, =lower and higher intensity peak in each pair being compared. entry. The use of this program is illustrated by the identification of compound no. 9 (fig. 3) in the essential oil Croton micans.This compound was found by visual analysis to be car-3-ene. This identification was also achieved by BSKO 10 program but not by a program using only mass spectral data where a-pinene had the highest similarity (see tables 1 and2 ) .The inspection of the a-pinene (fig. 4) and car-3-ene (fig. 5 ) mass spectra showed only minor quantitative differences, although they had distinct Kovat's indexes (927 * 3 and 1040 =t 3, respectively). This made it easy for the program  BSKO 10 to find the right answer by matching Kovat's indexes of the unknown against the Kovat's indexes of selected entries. Essential oils.-Essential oils found in table 3 were analyzed by the method described. Confirmations of the identified compounds were made by visual matching of each mass spectrum against standards of a certified collection (l5), and times, part studied and yields.    FIG. 1 .1FIG. 1 .
