BIOACTIVE SESQUITERPENE PYRIDINE ALKALOIDS FROM MA YTENUS AQUIFOLIUM
Two new sesquiterpene evoninate alkaloids, were isolated together with the known compounds syringaresinol and 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin from the root bark ofMaytenus aquiJolium. The structures of the two alkaloids were elucidated by interpretation of their spectral data, and both exhibited very weak activity in a mechanism-based DNA-modifying yeast assay.

INTRODUCTIONThe Celastraceae family is a rich source of sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids derived from polyester sesquiterpenes based on the dihydro-fl-agarofuran skeleton [1]. They are characterized by a macrocyclic structure formed by two ester linkages between a sesquiterpene and various dicarboxylic acids (e.g. evoninic acid, wilfordinic acid, edulinic acid, etc.) at positions 3 and 15 [2]. In our search for anticancer agents employing a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying agents [3,4] we have identified two sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids from Maytenus aquifolium Martius. In this paper we report the isolation and structural elucidation of two sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids aquifoliunine E-I (1) and aquifoliunine E-II (2) from M. aquifolium by application of 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques, including DQCOSY, HETCOR, HMBC, HMQC and NOESY, and their biological evaluation using the yeast bioassay system.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA CH2C12 soluble fraction from the methanolic extract of root bark ofM. aquifolium was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids 1 and 2.Aquifoliunine E-I (1), was shown to have a molec-* Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. {Permanent address: Departamento de Morfologia, CCBS, UFMS, C.P. 649, 79070-900, Brasil.

2.R~H, RZ~Hular formula C43H49NOt8 by analysis of its HRFABMS spectrum. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3488, 1750 and 1443 cm-~ characteristic of hydroxy, ester and phenyl groups, respectively [5,6]. The ~H and 13C NMR spectra ofl revealed the presence of five acetyl groups (fin  1 and2). Proton assignments around the bicyclic skeleton were determined based on interpretation of the DQCOSY spectrum. The spin system derived from H-let, H-2~, H-3fl, H-8fl and H-9~ was readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet at 6 5.63 assigned to H-I~ (J~,.2~ = 3.5 Hz) which showed a cross-peak with the 1H doublet of doublets at 6 5.25 assigned to H-2ct (J2~.~ = 3.5, J2~.3a = 2.5 Hz). This latter signal also showed a crosspeak with the 1H doublet at 6 4.73 assigned to H-3fl (J3a.2~ = 2.5 Hz). The 1H doublet of doublets at 3 5.67 assigned to H-Sfl (J8a.7a = 3.6, Jsa,9~ = 9.9 Hz) showed cross-peaks with the 1H doublets at 6 2.66 (H-7fl) and 6 5.89 (H-9et). The latter proton signal was also correlated with the H-8fl. The relative stereochemistry of the H-8fl and H-9ct was deduced from NOE difference experiment, in which irradiation of the methine resonance at ~ 6.73 (H-6) caused an enhancement of the signal at 6 5.67 (H-8fl). The irradiation of the methyl resonance at 6 1.81 (H-14) caused an enhancement of the signal at 6 5.89 corroborating the axial orientation of H-9 (Fig. 1). The two sets of methylenic protons consisting of two pairs of doublet of doublets at 6 4.62, 4.82 (Ju~.12b = 13.6 HZ) and 6 3.63, 5.96 (JJsalSb = 11.6 Hz) were assigned to H-11 and H-15, respectively. The presence of an esterified evoninic acid was indicated by two doublets at 6 1.20 and 1.39 assigned to two secondary methyl groups (H-10' and H-9') which showed cross-peaks with a pair of resonances at 6 2.58 and 4.65 assigned to H-8' and H-7', respectively (q, Js.. 10. and J7', 9' = 7.0 Hz). The configuration of the methyl groups of the evoninate-type compounds were determined as 7'S, 8'S (evoninic acid: 2S, 3S) by hydrolysis [7] and X-ray analysis [8]. The 2,3-disubstituted pyridine unit was determined by the signals Comparison of the 13C NMR data for I with those of horridine [9] showed a discrepancy in the literature assignments for some carbons in the structure and 12.0 q 12.0 q 10' 9.8 q 9.1 q 11' 174.0 s 174.5 s 12' 168.4 s 168.4 s OCOMe (C-I) 20.5 q 20.9 q OCOMe (C-2) 21.0 q OCOMe (C-6) 20.7 q 21.6 q OCOMe (C-9) 21.5 q 21.2 q OCOMe (C-I 1) 21.2 q 21.3 q OCOMe (C-I) 169.  ating at higher field than the corresponding protons of 1. In addition, H-2c~ and H-8fl did not show any cross-peaks with a carbonyl carbon resonance in the HMBC spectrum. Again, HETCOR analysis was used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons.The known compound 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin (3) was earlier isolated from M. evonymoides [10], M. riyida [11] and Ourotea sp. [12], while syringaresinol (4) [13], a 3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane lignan derivative, was isolated for the first time from Maytenus species.In the bioassay utilizing genetically engineered mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the sesquiterpene alkaloids aquifoliunine E-I (1) and aquifoliunine E-II (2) exhibited very weak bioactivity. Compounds I and 2 showed weak but selective activities with IC~2 values of 164 and 266; 160 and 167; 160 and 180/tg/mL in the mutant yeast strains RS 321N, RS 322YK (rad 52Y), and RS 167N (tad 6), respectively; they were inactive (IC~2 > 1000/~g/mL) in the "wild type" strain RS 188N (rad+). These results indicate these compounds might serve as the main components responsible for the slight DNA-damaging activity of M. aquifolium extract.Multiplicity in the DEPT spectrum is given after the respective chemical shifts: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet) and q (quartet).these have been revised based on HETCOR and HMBC data (see Table 2).Aquifoliunine E-II (2) has the molecular C34H43NO16 by analysis of its HRFABMS spectrum.It also was an evoninate type sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloid derivative of 1 and its sesquiterpene core contained four acetyl groups. Further oxygenated functional groups were assumed to be hydroxyl groups. The positions of these hydroxyl groups were confirmed at C- 
BioassaysThe experimental method utilized in the screening procedure has been described elsewhere [3,4]. The ICL2 values refer to the concentration in/~g/mL required to produce a zone of inhibition of 12 mm diameter around a 100/~1 well during a 48 h incubation period at 37'~C.
Extraction and isolation of constituentsThe dried and powdered root bark ofM. aquiJolium (153.5 g) was extracted with MeOH. The resulting MeOH extract was filtered and concd in vacuo to afford a brown gum (17.35 g). The CH2C12 soluble part of MeOH extract (1.43 g) was applied to a Si gel column (300 g), and eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc to give 68 frs. Fr. 10 (720 mg) was applied to a Si gel column (2.0 g) 230-400 mesh, and eluted with CHC13 with increasing amounts of MeOH to give 1 (9.8 rag). Fr. 14 (22.2 mg) was subjected to Si gel CC, eluted with CHC13 containing an increasing amount of MeOH to give 4 (5.1 rag). Fr. 20 (23.6 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel (CC) eluted with CHCI3 containing increasing amounts of MeOH to give 2 (2.6 mg). Fr. 30 (149.8 mg) was applied to Si gel (CC) eluted with CHC13 containing increasing amount of MeOH to give 3 (3.7 rag).Aqufoliunine E-I (1).

The location of the ester groups around the basic skeleton was solved by examination of the HMBC spectrum. The four acetoxy carbonyl resonances at 6 168.6, 169.1, 169.7, 169.8 and 170.0 were correlated with 3H singlets at 6 2.14, 1.82, 2.20, 1.88 and 2.33, respectively, and the attachment of these acetoxy groups at C-2, C-I, C-9, C-6 and C-11 was established by defining cross-peaks between the acetoxy carbonyl resonances and proton signals at 6 5.25 (H-2et), 5.63 (H-let), 5.89 (H-9et), 6.73 (H-6fl) and 4.62-4.82 (H-I1). The signal at 6 164.5 was assigned to the carbonyl carbon of the benzoate moiety based upon its cross-peak with the phenyl oprotons at 6 7.92. The signals ofa carbonyl carbon at 6 165.6 was assigned to C-2' based on it cross-peaks with the proton signals at 6 2.58, 4.65 (H-8', H-7') and fi 1.20, 1.39 (H-10', H-9'). Further correlations between the carbon signal at 6 174.0 (C-IV) and 6 168.4 (C-IT) with proton signals at 6 3.63-5.96 (H-15) and 6 4.73 (H-3) proved the attachment of the evoninate moiety to be at C-3 and C-15.
