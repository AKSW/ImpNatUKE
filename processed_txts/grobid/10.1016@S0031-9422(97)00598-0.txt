FLAVONOIDS FROM THE FRUITS OF MURRAYA PANICULATA"
INTRODUCTIONMurraya paniculata (Linn.) Jack, which is native to Southeast Asia, was introduced to Brazil and has flourished in Slo Paulo state. In Brazil it is used as an ornamental plant, but this plant is used for its medicinal properties in tropical and subtropical Asia [l]. A search for previous phytochemical studies of M. paniculuta revealed that only the coumarin, coumurrayin, has been reported from the ripe fruits of this species [2]. Working separately on peel and pulp of the fresh ripe fruits, we have isolated only polymethoxylated flavones, flavonols and flavanonols.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe dichloromethane extract of the peel of M. puniculata after successive chromatographic separations afforded six flavonoids: 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanonol [3,4], 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone (1) [5], 3,5,7,8,3',4',5'-heptamethoxyflavone (2) [6], 5,7,8,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone(3) [7], 5hydroxy-3,7,8,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone (4) and 8hydroxy-3,5,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyllavone (5). Compounds 4 and 5 appear to be novel.The i3C NMR data for 2 and 3 do not appear to have been reported in the literature. Thus, the 13C chemical shifts of 2 and 3 have been listed in Table 1 using 1 and 5,7,8,2',3',4',5'-heptamethoxyflavone (6) [3] as models. The carbon signals of 1, isolated from *Based in part on the Ph.D. thesis presented by R.J.F. to the Universidade Federal de Slo Carlos.t Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.Neoraputia magniJica (Rutaceae), were assigned by use of HMQC and HMBC experiments [5].Compound 4 was obtained as a yellow powder. The presence of a flavonoid nucleus was suggested by its UV and IR spectra. In the 'H NMR spectrum (Table 2) of 4, three aromatic protons appeared at 6 6.43 (lH, s) and 6 7.52 (2H, s, H-2' and H-6'), one hydroxyl group at 6 12.38 (lH, s, OH-5) and six methoxy groups at 6 3.95 (6H, s), 3.94 (6H, s), 3.92 (3H, s), and 3.90 (3H, s). The assignment of one singlet to H-2' and H-6' suggested that three methoxyls were attached to the B-ring. Furthermore, the singlet at 6 6.43 clearly indicated the A-ring to be 5,6,7-or 5,7,8-trisubstituted. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of 5hydroxy-7,8-and 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3,7,8-and 5-hydroxy-3,6,7-trimethoxyflavonol indicated that the C-6 methine (ca 6 96) resonates at a lower field than the C-8 methine (ca 6 91) [3]. Thus, the correct A-ring structure was, decided on the basis of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table l), which showed a signal at 6 95.5 for C-6, so placing the methoxyl substituents at C-7 and C-8. Moreover, the 13C NMR spectrum showed signals for three methoxyl groups at 6 61. Compound 5 exhibited similar NMR spectra to 4 (Table 1 and2) except for the absence of the signal for one chelated hydroxyl. The mass spectrum indicated a molecular formula C2,H2209 ([Ml+ = 418), which strongly suggested an isomer of 4. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed signals for two methoxyl groups at 6 6 1.3 and 60.1, which were assigned to the 3-and 4'-positions. This implies that the methoxyls in the A-ring were located at C-5 and C-7 (6 56.  of the C-ring followed by loss of a methyl group, respectively. These data were consistent with the structure of 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3',4'-pentamethoxytlavone for 9, which has been found previously in Citrus reticulutu (tangerine peel) [9]. Compound 10 gave spectral data in agreement with those published for 3,5,6,7,3',4',5'-heptamethoxyilavonol [lo]. However, its 13C NMR data do not appear to have been reported previously in the literature. Thus, they have been listed in Table 1 using 1, 2 and 3 as models.A dichloromethane-soluble fraction of the methanolic pulp extract gave four flavonoids: 3, 5, 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanonol [3, 41 and 3,5,7, 8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone [3, 111. Other organs of M. paniculata have long been the subject of extensive chemical investigations, which have proved that it is a rich source of coumarins, flavones and flavonols as are other plants of the Aurantioideae [12]. The leaves have been reported to contain 2 [13], 3 [l, 131 and 10 [lo], while 3 has also been found in the roots [7]. Flavonol 1 has been isolated from the leaves of M. exotica [6], which has been considered to be a synonym of M. paniculata [14]. By contrast, the flowers appear to be poor in flavonoids. However, the only flavonol, 3,5,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxyflavone, reported from the flowers shows an oxidation level comparable to those of the leaves. Flavonol 9, 3,5,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone and 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanonol are reported for the first time from the Murruya, while the latter does not appear to have been recorded previously from the Rutaceae. Isolation of compounds. The seeds, peel and pulp of the fresh ripe fruits were sepd by a perforated plate sieve (0.5 mm; tyler 32). The seeds and peel were dried, powdered and successively extracted with hexane, CH,C12 and MeOH. The pulp was stirred with MeOH at room temp. The extract was decanted, and the residual pulp similarly extracted a second time. The combined extracts were evapd under vacuum and the residue partitioned into hexane-, CH2C12-, MeOHand n-BuOH-soluble frs.The coned CH2C1, extract of peel was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using hexane-Me,CO (9:1), yielding 48 frs. Fr 23 was chromatographed on silica gel using hexane-CH,Cl,-MeOH (10: 10: 1) as eluents affording further frs. Fr 23-4 purified x 2 by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexane-CH#&MeOH, 1O:lO:l) to yield a mixt. of 1 and 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanonol (40 mg), which was sepd by R-HPLC (detection UV 1 254 nm) to give 1 (1st peak, 18 mg) and 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavanonol (2nd peak, 16 mg), after recycling x 3/ Fr 33 was purified by prep. TLC as above to afford 2 (15 mg), 3 (13 mg) and 4 (15 mg). Fr 50 was purified as above affording 5 (20 mg).The coned hexane-soluble pulp fr. was repeatedly purified by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexaneMe,CO, 3: 1) to yield 10 (20 mg) and a mixt. of 4 and 9 (15 mg).The coned CH,Cl,-soluble pulp. fr. was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with a hexane-Me&O gradient afforded 5 (23 mg), 5,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavonol (20 mg), 3 (22 mg) and a mixt. of 2 and 3,5,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavonol (38 mg) which was purified by RP-HPLC as above.

This was corroborated by the fragments at m/z 207 [C12H,404-Me]+ and 181 [C9H805 -Me]+, associated with the retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of the C-ring followed by the loss of a methyl group, respectively. From these data 4 was characterized as 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3',4',5'hexamethoxyflavone. The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of 4',5-dihydroxy-3,3',7,8-tetramethoxyflavone (ternatin, 7) and 4',5-dihydroxy-,8-trimethoxy-7-(3-methylbut-2-enyloxy)-flavone (8) [8]. Complete and unambiguous r3C NMR assignments for 8 were made using the HMBC technique PI.
4 and 56.1) and determined the position of the hydroxyl group at C-8. The 5,7,8-and 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavones can be differentiated by the 13C NMR chemical shifts of the unsubstituted methine which absorbs at 6 92.6 OH 0 7:&=OMe &Rq=OPre (C-6, for example 6) in the case of the former [3] and at 6 96.3 (C-8, for example 1) in the case of the latter. Thus, the 13C signal at 6 91.6 for C-6 supported the proposed structure of 5 as 8-hydroxy-3,5,7,3',4',5'hexamethoxyflavone. A hexane-soluble fraction of the hydromethanolic extract of pulp after successive chromatographic separations afforded three flavonols: 4, 9 and 10. Compound 4 could not be separated from a small amount of 9. The 'H NMR in addition to signals described above for 4, revealed the presence of three protons in the B-ring, giving rise to an ABC coupling system (6 7.02, d, J = 8.8 Hz, H-5'; 6 7.81, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2', 6 7.86, dd, J = 8.8 and 2.0 Hz, H-6'). This was supported by the mass spectrum which showed fragments at m/z 177 [C1rHn03-Me]+ and 181 [C,Hs05 -Me]+ due to the retro-Diels-Alder cleavage
