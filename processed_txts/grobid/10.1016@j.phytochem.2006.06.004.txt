Cadinane sesquiterpenoids of Phomopsis cassiae, an endophytic fungus associated with Cassia spectabilis (Leguminosae)
Five cadinane sesquiterpenes derivatives were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation from Phomopis cassiae, an endophytic fungus isolated from Cassia spectabilis. The structures of the two diastereoisomeric 3,9,12-trihydroxycalamenenes (1, 2); 3,12-dihydroxycalamenene (3); 3,12-dihydroxycadalene (4) and 3,11,12-trihydroxycadalene (5) were established on the basis of analyses of 1D and 2D NMR and HRTOFMS experiments. Antifungal activity of the isolates was evaluated against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Cladosporium cladosporioides, revealing 5 as the most active compound.

IntroductionEndophytic fungi are organisms living within the tissues of hosts plants (Andrews and Hirano, 1991). These organisms are known as potential sources of biologically active secondary metabolites (Dreyfuss and Chapela, 1994;Tan and Zou, 2001;Strobel et al., 2004) and relatively little is known about the potential of these microorganisms from Brazilian endemic plant species (Azevedo et al., 2000(Azevedo et al., , 2004)).As part of our studies on bioactive agents from metabolites produced by endophytic fungi associated with species of native plants from the Brazilian Cerrado, we initially selected 16 species of plants, which had already been phytochemically profiled by our group. Those species were submitted for isolation of endophytic fungi and 82 pure isolates were obtained, preserved, cultivated in liquid media and extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain crude extracts. Some metabolites produced by fungi were already published by our group (Teles et al., 2005;Cafe ˆu et al., 2005;Silva et al., 2005).The crude EtOAc extract of Phomopsis cassiae isolated from Cassia spectabilis showed moderate antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Cladosporium cladosporioides, stimulating further studies. Bioassay guided fractionation of this extract afforded five new sesquiterpenes (1-5). 
Results and discussionCompound 1 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C 15 H 22 O 3 ([M + Na] + at m/z 273.1486). Their IR spectra revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm À1 ) and phenolic groups (1466, 1690 cm À1 ). The 1 H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) showed two aromatic signals, one at d 6.87 (1H, s) and the other at d 6.43 (1H, s), suggesting a tetra-substituted aromatic spin-system with a para configuration. A series of complex signals at The 13 C NMR chemical shifts for 1 along with the information obtained from a DEPT-135 experiment (Table 1), indicated a total of 15 signals, suggesting a sesquiterpene: six aromatic carbons at d 152.9 (s), 141.1 (s), 128.1 (d), 127.4 (s), 121.9 (s) and 114.7 (d), confirming the tetra-substitution for the aromatic moiety and the para hydrogen system; two carbinolic signals: a methine at d 67.8 and a methylene at d 64.4; three signals for methines at d 40. 1, 38.4 and 36.5; one aliphatic methylene at d 24.6 and three signals for methyl groups: d 16.7, 15.9 and 10.8. The above data suggested a cadinane skeleton (Zhang et al., 1998;Nagashima et al., 1996). The total attribution for the observed signals was accomplished based on gHMQC correlations.Additional gHMBC correlations of H-5 (d 6.87) with C-15 and C-7 (d 15.9 and d 36.5, respectively) and H-2 (d 6.43) with C-10 and C-4 (d 40.1 and d 121.9) allowed us to fully determine the aromatic moiety. The phenolic function linked at C-3, was supported by the correlations between H-15 (d 2.05) and C-3/C-5 (d 152.9 and d 128.1, respectively). The linkage of the p-menthane moiety was determined through the correlations shown by C-1 (d 141.1) with H-14/H-9 (d 1.03/d 3.76) and C-6 (d 127.4) with, H-11/H-8b (d 2.70/d 1.52). Observed correlations between C-12 ! H-7 (d 64.4/3.04) and H-13 ! C-7 (d 0.51/36.5) allowed us to fully determine the calamenene skeleton (Nagashima et al., 1996).gNOESY was useful to establish the relative configuration of the stereocenters for 1. A correlations between Me-14 and Me-13 confirmed a cis-calamenene, according to reported literature (Croft et al., 1978;Anderson et al., 1972;Nabeta et al., 1993). Further observed correlations between H-9a and H-7 allowed us to confirm a (cis)-1,3-pseudo-diaxial relationship between these centers (Nabeta et al., 1993). We were not able to determine the configuration of the stereocenter at C-11, due to free rotation of this center with C-7-C-11 bond. Compound 1 was thus identified as the rel. (À)-(7S, 9S, 10S)-3,9,12trihydroxycalamenene.Compound 2 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C 15 H 22 O 3 ([M + HÀH 2 O] + ) at m/z 233.1542. The obtained mass and similarities observed in the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra (Table 1) indicated that 2 was a diastereoisomer of 1. The main spectroscopic differences observed for this molecule were elucidated by using gNOESY. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 indicated that both groups remained in a cis conformation. The appearance of a strong correlation of Me-14 and H-9 indicated that H-7 and H-9 were in a trans conformation. Further comparisons with reported data (Croft et al., 1978;Anderson et al., 1972;Nabeta et al., 1993) allowed us to provisionally deduce identify 2 as rel. (+)-(7S, 9R, 10S) the C-9 diastereoisomer of 1.Compound 3 was isolated as a white amorphous powder. HRESI mass data allowed us to propose the molecular formula C 15 H 22 O 2 ([M + H] + at m/z 235.1777). The absence of an oxygen atom in this molecule allowed us to provisionally deduce that a reduction occurred at position C-9. This reduction was confirmed by 13 C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) due to the presence of the signal at d 28.5 and the lack of the carboxymethine signal at d 67.8/69.1 present in 1 and 2, respectively.A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 was observed in the gNOESY experiment thus concluding that 3 has a cis calamenene relative stereochemistry. Observed correlations between H-9a and H-8a and H-7 defined their relative configuration also as cis. Further observed correlations between H-8b and H-9b, confirmed the relative configuration established for the p-menthane moiety. Compound 3 was hence identified as the rel. (+)-(7S, 10S) 3,12dihydroxycalamenene.Compound 4 was isolated as a white amorphous powder. A molecular formula C 15 H 18 O 2 ([M + H] + at m/z 231.1405) was obtained after HRESI mass data analysis. The 1 H NMR data (Table 1) showed a new aromatic hydrogen spin system at d 7.03 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) and d 6.93 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) with an ortho configuration. The downfield shift observed for Me-14 (%Dd +1.3) was indicative of an aromatization of the p-menthane moiety (Nabeta et al., 1994). 13 C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) data showed 10 aromatic carbons, three methyls: two benzylic and one aliphatic; one carboxymethylene and one benzylic methine, indicative of the presence of a naphthalene skeleton. All correlations were determined using gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, and compared with reported data for cadalene analogues (Kubo et al., 1996;Nabeta et al., 1994;Stipanovic et al., 1975).Further correlations observed in the gHMBC experiment, particularly the ones of H-8 (d 6.93) with C-6/C-11 and H-9 (d 7.03) with C-1/C-14 allowed us to fully determine the substitution pattern of the B ring for the naphthalene moiety. Compound 4 was identified as 3,12dihydroxycadalene.Compound 5 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C 15 H 18 O 3 ([M + Na] + at m/z 269.1179). The appearance of a hydroxyl group in 5 was corroborated by the loss of the signal assigned to H-11 (d 3.59) in 4 thus suggesting that oxidation had occurred at this position. 13 C NMR and DEPT-135 spectroscopic data corroborated this assumption showing a signal at d 75.3 (s) which exhibited a correlation showed in the gHMBC experiment with H-8 (d 7.21) indicating that the new oxidized position was at C-11. Other correlations were determined using gCOSY, gHMQC, and compared with reported data for analogues (Kubo et al., 1996;Nabeta et al., 1994;Stipanovic et al., 1975). Compound 5 was identified as the new 3,11,12trihydroxycadalene.The antifungal activity of compounds 1-5 against the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum was evaluated by bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). The compound 3,12-dihydroxycadalene (2) exhibited potent activity against two fungi. The detection limit for the compound 5 was found to be 1.0 lg, comparable with the same amount of the standard nystatin.Cytotoxicity of the compounds 1-5 against human cervical tumor cell line (HeLa) were tested using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983). Compound 4 exhibited cytotoxicity against cell line (IC 50 20 lmol L À1 ), and 3 and 5 a weak cytotoxicity (IC 50 100 and 110 lmol L À1 , respectively). Cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent, was used as positive control with IC 50 5 lmol L À1 .
Experimental
General experimental procedureOptical rotations were determined at room temperature using Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR and UV spectra were recorded on Perkin-Elmer 1710 spectrometer and Perkin-Elmer UV-Vis 14P spectrometer. Melting points were measured on Microquimica MQAPF-301. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra; gHMBC and gHMQC, gCOSY and TOCSY experiments were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 NMR, with TMS as internal standard. Electrospray mass and tandem mass spectra in both positive and negative ion modes were recorded on a Q-Tof (Micromass) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) and high-resolution orthogonal time of flight (o-TOF) configuration. The sample introduction was performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Pump 11) set to 10 ll/min pumped through an uncoated fused-silica capillary. All samples were dissolved in MeOH-H 2 O (1:1). The HRESI-MS mass spectra were acquired using a ESI capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10 V. ESI-MS/ MS spectra of mass selected ions were acquired using 10-20 eV collisions with argon. For preparative HPLC separations, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, and a Phenyl-hexyl Luna Phenomenex column, (250 • 21.20 mm, 5 lm), were used in this study. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromato-integrator connected to a UV detector.TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F 254 plates (Merck). Spots were visualized spraying anisaldehyde 5% in H 2 SO 4 followed by heating.
Plant materialAuthenticated C. spectabilis plant material was collected in the Chemistry Institute UNESP -Araraquara, SP, Brazil in June 17, 2001 by G.H. Silva. The botanical identification was made by Professor Maria Cla ´udia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa ˜o Paulo,.
Isolation of the endophytic fungusThe fungal strain P. cassiae was an endophyte isolated from leaves of C. spectabilis. The leaves were washed in running H 2 O and surface sterilized by successive soaking in NaOCl 1% for 5 min, 70% EtOH for 1 min and then rinsed twice with water. Aseptically the leaves were cut open and 1 • 1 cm 2 pieces of the leaves were placed on water agar in Petri plates. After incubation at 25 °C for seven days, individual hyphal tips of the emerging fungi were removed and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Maier et al., 1997). During the first three weeks of incubation, the cultures were periodically checked for purity and successively subcultured by hyphal tipping method until pure culture was obtained. Cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar. The taxonomic identification as P. cassiae was performed based on fungal morphology by Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited Colec ¸a ˜o Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lavras fungal herbarium and assigned as CML 292.
Growth of P. cassiae and production of the EtOAc extractThe fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 °C for 15 min. Approximately 10 small pieces (1 • 1 cm) of PDA medium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the P. cassiae isolated were inoculated into each flask and the flasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 °C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the flasks was separated from the aqueous medium by filtration. The culture broth was extracted with EtOAc (3 • 2,0 L). The EtOAc extracts were combined, filtered, and evaporated in vacuo to give a yellow oil (277.12 mg).
Antifungal assayThe microorganisms C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Bota ˆnica, Sa ˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil. Compounds 1-5 were applied on a precoated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 lL) containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 lg. After eluting with CHCl 3 :CH 3 OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as positive control.
Cytotoxicity bioassaysThe human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) assay was performed as previously described (Mosmann, 1983). Cisplatin was used as positive control (IC 50 5.0 lmol L À1 ).
Extraction and isolationThe extract was subjected to C18 column chromatography employing gradient elution from H 2 O to MeOH, to yield 7 fractions (H 2 O:MeOH,85:15,65:35,60:40,55:45,45:55,35:65, 00:100 each 150 mL). 1 H NMR spectroscopic analyses identified fractions 3, 4 and 5 as promising for further fractionation. The fraction 3 (23.0 mg) was purified by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phenomenex 21.20 • 250 mm; using CH 3 CN:H 2 O (19:81) as the solvent, flow rate 10 mL/min; UV detection at 248 nm] to afford sesquiterpene 1 (3.5 mg). Fraction 4 (15.0 mg) was purified by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phenomenex 21.20 • 250 mm; using CH 3 CN:H 2 O (22:78) as the solvent, flow rate 10 mL/ min; UV detection at 248 nm] to afford sesquiterpenes 2 (2.5 mg) and 4 (4.0 mg). Fraction 5 (30.0 mg) was purified by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phenomenex 21.20 • 250 mm] using CH 3 CN:H 2 O (29:71) as the solvent, flow rate 10 mL/min; UV detection at 248 nm] to afford sesquiterpenes 3 (4.0 mg) and 5 (4.8 mg). 
3.d 3.76 (1H, m) 3.35 (4H, m); d 3.04 (1H, m) and d 2.30 (1H, m) were indicative of two carbinolic and two benzyl hydrogens, respectively. Further signals at d 0.51 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), d 1.03 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), d 2.05 (3H, s) revealed the presence of two aliphatic and one aromatic methyl groups in the molecule.
