TERPENO-p-HYDROXYBENZOIC ACID DERIVATIVES FROM RAPANEA UMBELLATA*
leaves of Rapanea umbellota yielded three terpeno-p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives which appear to be novel. These compounds were identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis as 3-geranyl-4-hydroxy-5-(3",3"dimethylallyl)-benzoic acid; 5-carboxy-7-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-2-(:l'-hydroxy-l',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran and 6-carboxy-8-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-3a-hydroxy-2a-methyl-2-(4'-methylpent-3'-enyl)-3,4-dihydrobenzopyran.The fruits of Rapanea umbellata (Mart.) Mez. have been shown to contain 3,6-dihydroxy-2-undecyl-p-benzoquinone, embehn [l]. An investigation of the leaves of R. umbellata, a Brazilian shrub or small tree, has led to the isolation of three additional compounds which were purified as their methyl esters (l-3) and which appear to be novel.
RESULTS AND DISCLSSIONThe dichloromethane extract of the leaves yielded, on chromatography over silica gel, 3-geranyl-5-prenyl-p-hydroxybenzoic acid (1) and two of its derivates (2,3). The three acids were methylated with diazomethane prior to analysis.The most apolar compound (l), C23H3203 (MS), gave rise to an IR spectrum which indicated the presence of an arylcarbomethoxy (1720 cm-') and a hydroxy group (335Ocn-').'HNMR spectroscopy (Table 1) showed the aromatic ring to be 1,3,4,5_tetrasubstituted, with CO,Me (63.85) and hydroxyl pore with respect to each other. The unsubstituted C-2 and C-6 (2H, brs, 87.69) must be vicinal to CO,Me. The 'H NMR spectrum also showed the presence of y,y-dimethylallyl and geranyl systems [2, 33 (6 1.77-1.62, 5 vinyl methyls, 6 5.34, 3 olefinic protons and 63.29, 2 arylallyl substituted methylenes). The mass spectrum showed peaks which indicated CsH, (m/z 339 and 231, Scheme 1) and C,,H,, (m/z 231 and 271, Scheme 1) substituents, both adjacent to the phenolic hydroxyl [4]. Acetylation of 1 with acetic anhydride in pyridine gave an acetate which confirmed the presence of a phenolic group. The 13C NMR chemical shifts for the y,r-dimethylallyl and geranyl groups agreed closely with published data for these groups in 3,4dihydroxy-5-(2-isopentenyl)-benzoic acid (4) [2]  new natural product is therefore 3-geranyl-4-hydroxy-5-(3",3''-dimethylallyl)-benzoic acid.Compound 2, C,,H,,O,, had IR absorptions similar to 1. The 'H NMR spectrum (Table l), in addition to signals typical of a prenylbenzoic acid methyl ester, revealed two benzylic protons (63.22 and 3.20 H-3a, J = 8.5 Hz; H-3b, J = 9.4 Hz) which coupled with one oxymethine proton (64.69, dd, H-2, J=9.4, 8.5 Hz), characteristic of a 2,3-dihydro-benzofurane derivative [6,73. Methyl resonances at 6 1.67, 1.60 and 1.27, as well as signals for an olefinic proton (65.10) and a hydroxyl (62.59) suggested the presence of a 1'-hydroxy-1',5'dimethylhex-4'-enyl side chain attached to the dihydrofuran ring on C-2. This was supported by the mass spectrum which showed fragments at m/z 245 and 127 (Scheme 1) due to fission of the side chain between C-2 and C-l'. The identification of the nucleus as a dihydrobenzofuran received further support from the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which showed close agreement with published data for this group in 6 [6]. Compound 2 was resistant to (Ac,O-pyridine).The mass, 'H and ' 3C NMR spectra of the tetrahydroderivative indicated the absence of aliphatic double bonds. The structure of the new natural product is therefore 5-carboxy-7-(3",3"dimethylallyl)-2-(l'-hydroxy-l',5'-dimethy~hex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.The third compound (3) also showed the spectral characteristics of a prenylbenzoic acid methyl ester. However, the mass spectrum gave significant fragments for m/z 289 and 233 (Scheme 1) requiring the presence of an hydroxyl group in the dihydropyran substituent. The '%J NMR spectrum (Table 2     The CH,CI, extract (5.5 g) was chromatographed on a dry column over silica gel using CH,CI,-EtOAc (4: 1) for elution. The column was cut into seven parts. All fractions were methylated with CH,N, yielding the corresponding methyl esters which were subsequently purified by CC over silica gel eluting with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc. Fr. 2 gave l(30 mg), fr. 3 gave 2 (400 mg) and frs 5 and 6 gave 3 (300 mg).

In addition, two olefinic carbon signals at 6 132.20 and 123.75 confirmed the presence of the 4'-methylpent-3'-enyl side chain at C-2 of the dihydropyran structure.

shift of the Me-2 signal (A6 0.72) suggested for hydroxyl and Me-2 a cis relationship. Oxidation of 3b with PCC and subsequent reduction with sodium borohydride gave the two possible epimers (6 1.26, 2%-Me; S 1.28, 2,Y-Me). Addition of Eu(fod), caused a shift (A6 0.58) of the Me-2 signal at 6 1.26. The structure of the new natural product was thus established as 6-carboxy-8-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-3~-hydroxy-2a-methyl-2-(4'-methylpent-3'-enyl)-3.4-dihydrobenzopyran. Previous studies of the Myrsinaceae have led to the isolation of a number of 3,6-dihydroxy-2-alkylbenzoquinones [8]. 3-Geranylated-S-prenylated-p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, which are very rare in nature, have been found in one of the Myrsinaceae species. Other m-y,y-dimethylallylbenzoic acid derivatives have been recorded in the Compositae [Z, 6, 73. However, 3geranylated-5-prenylated-p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives represent a novel group of terpeno-p-hydroxybenzoic acids.
