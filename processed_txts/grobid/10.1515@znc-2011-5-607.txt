Effect of Triterpenoids and Limonoids Isolated from Cabralea canjerana and Carapa guianensis (Meliaceae) against Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith)
The activities of two triterpenoids, ocotillone and cabraleadiol, and four limonoids, methyl angolensate, 3-β-deacetylfi ssinolide, 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin, and β-photogedunin, isolated from arillus of Carapa guianensis and fruits and seeds of Cabralea canjerana (Meliaceae), were evaluated against the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda. Gedunin was used as a positive control. 7-Deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin and β-photogedunin reduced the pupal weight as occurred with gedunin. Cabraleadiol, 3-β-deacetylfi ssinolide, and 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin prolonged the larval phase similar to the control (gedunin) of approximately 1.2 days at 50.0 mg kg -1 . The highest insecticidal activity was obtained for β-photogedunin.

IntroductionIn the last decades considerable efforts have been devoted to the discovery of new sources of botanical insecticides and antifeedants. Among the plant families studied, Meliaceae and Rutaceae are perhaps the most promising (Schoonhoven, 1982), at least partly due to the presence of limonoids and triterpenoids characteristic of the Rutales order. The biological activity of limonoids from Rutales has been reviewed (Champagne et al., 1992). Some neem-based botanical insecticides have already been developed and marketed (Schmutterer, 1990(Schmutterer, , 1995(Schmutterer, , 2005)).Carapa guianensis Aublet, also called andiroba, andiroba-saruva, iandirova, carapá, and nandiroba (Lorenzi and Matos, 2002), is a tall Meliaceae tree growing wild throughout South America, West India, and South Africa. In Brazil, it can be found prevalently in fl ooded areas of the Amazon rainforest (Ambrozin et al., 2006). From the nuts of this plant an oil, called andiroba oil, is extracted, which has a long history of traditional use in South America, as analgesic, anti-infl ammatory, insecticide, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and as an anticancer remedy (Bickii et al., 2000;Gilbert et al., 1999;MacKinnon et al., 1997;Moura et al., 2002). Andiroba oil is rich in fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids, together with 2 -5% of unsaponifi able material. In addition, from several parts of Carapa guianensis limonoids, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins, fl avonoids, and diglycerides have been isolated (Lavie et al., 1973;Marcelle and Moto, 1975;Ollis et al., 1964Ollis et al., , 1970;;Qi et al., 2003Qi et al., , 2004)).Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. (Meliaceae) ("canjarana") is a native tree of economic importance in Brazil. It is a dioecious tree with widespread distribution in the neotropics, extending from Costa Rica to southern Brazil and northern Argentina. According to Pennington et al. (1981), it inhabits mainly nonfl ooded evergreen lowland or lower hill rain forests.In the present paper, triterpenoids and limonoids isolated from C. canjerana and C. guianensis were examined for their effects on the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). S. frugiperda is a major pest of many crops in the Americas and one of the most important pests of tropical maize, causing up to 34% reduction in the overall productivity of this crop in Brazil (Cruz et al., 1996).
Material and Methods
Plant materialCabralea canjerana was collected at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, MG, Brazil, and identifi ed by T. D. Pennington from the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, UK. A voucher (1842;1983) is deposited in the herbarium of Departamento de Engenharia Florestal Dendrologia, Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, MG, Brazil.The arillus of the Carapa guianensis seeds were supplied by Cognis Brasil Ltda., Av. Nações Unidas 10989, 4° andar, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.
Compounds isolationFruits (460 g) and seeds (200 g) from C. canjerana were extracted with ethanol, at room temperature for three times. The ethanolic extract (88.3 g) of the fruits was submitted to liquid-liquid partition with 120 ml methanol/water (3:1, v/v) solution. This solution was partitioned with different solvents to give fractions in n-hexane (fr-Hex, 47.4 g), dichloromethane (fr-CH 2 Cl 2 , 5.4 g), ethyl acetate (fr-EtOAc, 4.4 g), and methanol (fr-MeOH, 11.9 g). The fraction fr-Hex (2.8 g) was submitted to a silica gel column (230 -400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 45 fractions of 50 ml) using nhexane/dichloromethane/ethyl acetate/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase, yielding nine fractions (fr-Hex.1 to fr-Hex.10) after TLC analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2 (102 mg) was rechromatographed by column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20 as stationary phase (column 3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., 26 fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol/dichloromethane, 1:1, v/v), yielding three fractions (fr-Hex.2.1 to fr-Hex.2.3) after comparison by TLC analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2.2 (88.6 mg) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230 -400 mesh, 3.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 10 fractions of 5 ml each) eluted with n-hexane/acetone (9:1, v/v) to afford ocotillone (1, 16.3 mg) and cabraleadiol (2, 24.4 mg).The ethanolic extract (14.3 g) of the seeds of C. canjerana was chromatographed on microcrystalline cellulose-D and silica gel (column 5.0 x 22.0 cm i.d., fractions of 250 ml each) using n-hexane (250 ml) followed by dichloromethane (1 l), acetone (1 l), and methanol (1 l) as mobile phases yielding 13 fractions (EES-1 to EES-13). The fraction EES-2 (1.72 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (230 -400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 69 fractions of 10 ml each) using n-hexane/ acetone/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile phase to yield eleven fractions (EES-2.1 to EES-2.11) which were joined based on TLC. The fraction EES-2.6 (293.4 mg) was rechromatographed by column chromatography using a Sephadex LH-20 column (3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., fractions of 10 ml each) with isocratic elution (methanol), yielding fi fteen fractions (EES-2.6.1 to EES-2.6.15). The fraction EES-2.6.7 afforded methyl angolensate (3, 48.2 mg). The fraction EES-2.7 (230.6 mg) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230 -400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 35 fractions of 10 ml each), using n-hexane/ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v) as mobile isocratic phase, yielding seventeen fractions (EES-2.7.1 to EES-2.7.17). The fraction EES-2.7.9 afforded 3-β-deacetylfi ssinolide (4, 63.7 mg).The arillus ethanolic extract (10.0 g) of C. guianensis was submitted to vacuum chromatography using silica gel as stationary phase (70 -230 mesh, column 30 x 5 cm i.d.) and n-hexane followed by CH 2 Cl 2 , EtOAc, and MeOH (1 l each) as mobile phases, yielding four fractions (H, D, Ac, Me). The fraction Ac (3.8 g) was submitted to column chromatography over silica gel (230 -400 mesh, 30 x 4 cm i.d., n-hexane and acetone gradient as eluent, starting with pure n-hexane and fi nishing with pure acetone, 32 fractions of 200 ml each) to give fi ve fractions (Ac1 to Ac5). The fraction Ac3 (3.0 g) was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (230 -400 mesh, 10 x 3 cm i.d.) eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH 2 Cl 2 to MeOH, 28 fractions of 50 ml each) to yield ten fractions (Ac3.1 to Ac3.10). The limonoids 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5, 24.4 mg) and β-photogedunin (6, 14.4 mg) were isolated from fraction Ac3.2 by recycling HPLC (Asahipack polymeric column; eluent, methanol/ dichloromethane, 7:3, v/v; fl ow, 4 ml min -1 ).
Biological activityLarvae of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) were obtained from the Insect Bioassay Laboratory of Universidade Federal de São Carlos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil, and reared on semi-artifi cial diets (Kasten et al., 1978;Parra, 1986). They were maintained in an incubation chamber with a photoperiod of 12 h light/12 h dark, (70  5)% relative humidity, and (25  1) °C.For each treatment and control, 30 neonate larvae of S. frugiperda were used. A solution of compound was added to ascorbic acid (1.56 g; an ingredient of the diet). After evaporation of the solvent, the mixture was incorporated into the semi-artifi cial diet in which bean and wheat germ are the basic ingredients (Kasten et al., 1978) at fi nal contents of 1.0, 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 mg kg -1 for 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5), and 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg -1 for ocotillone (1), cabraleadiol (2), methyl angolensate (3), 3-β-deacetylfi ssinolide (4), and β-photogedunin (6). The diet for the control was prepared similarly but without the triterpenoids or limonoids. Gedunin (7) was used as positive control. The diets were placed in previously sterilized glass tubes (8.5 cm × 2.5 cm), into which larvae of S. frugiperda were introduced individually. The pupae were weighed 1 d after pupation and were transferred to plastics cups, where they stayed until the emergence of adults. Daily observations were made and the following parameters were evaluated: (1) duration of larval and pupal phases, (2) weight of pupae, and (3) percentage of dead insects (mortality) at the end of each phase.
StatisticsData were submitted to an analysis of variance ANOVA (Zar, 1974), and the averages were com-pared applying the Tukey test (P  0.05). Each tube containing one insect, independent of the developed phase, was considered as one replicate, therefore, the number of replicates was different for each treatment. For evaluation of the mortality of the larvae and pupae, the experimental unit was constituted by the mean of fi ve tubes containing one larva each, with six replications by treatment.
Results and DiscussionThe triterpenoids 1 and 2 and limonoids 3 and 4 were isolated from the fruits and seeds of C. canjerana and the limonoids 5 and 6 from the arillus of C. guianensis (Fig. 1). Their structures were confi rmed by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy and comparison with data from the literature (Braga et al., 2006;Ambrozin et al., 2006).Compounds 1 -6 were incorporated in the semi-artifi cial diet. 2, 4, and 5 affected larval development (Table I), and only 6 affected pupal development at concentrations of 10 and 50 mg [(8.5  1.64) days and (8.9  1.25) days, respectively, control (10.1  1.45) days]. Larvae fed with Fig. 1. The triterpenoids ocotillone (1) and cabraleadiol (2), and the limonoids methyl angolensate (3), 3-β-deacetylfi ssinolide (4), 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin ( 5), and β-photogedunin (6) isolated from Carapa guianensis and Cabralea canjerana, and of gedunin ( 7). semi-artifi cial diet treated with 5 and 6 showed signifi cant reduction in the pupal weight (17.8 and 31.5 mg at 50 mg kg -1 , respectively), comparable to the effect of gedunin (7, 27.2 mg, Table I).Larvae fed with semi-artifi cial diet treated with 2, 4, and 5 at 50.0 mg kg -1 prolonged the larval time for approximately 1.2 days similar to gedunin, suggesting that these compounds act as larval growth inhibitors (Table I).Compounds 2 and 4 prolonged the larval phase, although no alteration in pupal weight was observed. Tanzubil and McCaffery (1990) observed that larvae treated with low doses of azadirachtin produced pupae with a weight comparable to that of the controls, suggesting that they did not experience any severe feeding inhibition.Compound 5 also effected prolongation of the larval phase followed by reduction of the pupal weight. The larvae treated with 5 showed prolongation of the larval phase by 1.4 days (at 50.0 mg kg -1 ) and 2.6 days (at 100.0 mg kg -1 ) when compared with the control (14.9 days, Table I). The reduction of the pupal weight was by 17.8 and 25.8 mg at 50.0 and 100.0 mg kg -1 , respectively, when compared with the control (262.5 mg, Table I).Larvae treated with 6 at 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg kg -1 presented reduction of the pupal weight by 30.0, 31.1, and 31.5 mg, respectively, when compared with the control (272.7 mg, Table I). This compound reduced the duration of the pupal phase by 1.2 days and that of the larval phase was increased by 0.6 days, while gedunin affected only the larval phase by 1.3 days at 50 mg kg -1 (Table I).Ocotillone (1) isolated from the leaves of Dysoxylum malabaricum (Govindachari et al., 1994) was tested against Spodoptera litura and showed excellent PFI (percentage feeding index) values comparable to those of azadiradione, epoxyazadiradione, and limonin (Govindachari et al., 1995).Methyl angolensate (3) exhibited insecticidal activity against S. litura in no-choice tests (Abdelgaleil and Nakatani, 2003;Suresh et al., 2002;Powel et al., 1991), and this result agrees with that observed in the present work. Isolated from diethyl ether and acetone extracts of the stem bark of Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae) 3 showed antifeedant activity by the conventional leaf disc method on the third-instar larvae of Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd., Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) at 500 μg ml -1 (Abdelgaleil and Nakatani, 2003;Suresh et al., 2002) in a study examining structure-insect antifeedant relationships of plants belonging to the Rutales order. In a dual-choice antifeedant bioassay against Spodoptera litura L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), methyl angolensate (3) showed a PFI of 65.3, near to that of cedrelone (51.5). Two limonoids (sandoricin and 6-hydroxysandoricin) isolated from seed extracts of Sandoricum koetjape Merr. (Meliaceae), which possess chemical structures similar to that of methyl angolensate (3), showed signifi cant antifeedant activity against the fall armyworm (S. frugiperda), incorporated in diet at 25 ppm, and similar activity against the European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), at 200 ppm. Toxicity results for both insects indicated that continued feeding on diets containing sandoricin or 6-hydroxysandoricin at the 200 ppm level would result in nearly 100% mortality prior to pupation (Powell et al., 1991).β-Photogedunin (6) presented the highest insecticidal activity against S. frugiperda causing mortality of 53.3% in the larval stage and 20.0% in the pupal phase at 50 ppm. These results agree with those of Céspedes et al. (2000), who tested an epimeric mixture of photogedunin and their corresponding acetates and observed that these compounds caused signifi cant mortality of S. frugiperda larvae (45% to 100% at 10.0 to 52.0 ppm) after 7 days, as well as growth reduction, and photogedunin acetates showed the highest insecticidal activity at 10.0 ppm with 17% survival.Compounds 1, 3, 5, and 6 showed moderate insecticidal activity at 50.0 mg kg -1 with 40.0, 40.0, 33.3, and 53.3% mortality, respectively, for the larval phase. Although the compounds tested here were less active than the positive the control gedunin (7, 63.3%), the use of these compounds, in particular 6, is suggested for the control of S. frugiperda. Comparison of the activities of 6 and 7 suggests that oxidation of the furan ring led to a decrease in the insecticidal activity.Table I .IMean duration of larval stage, weight of pupae, and larvae mortality in Spodoptera frugiperda treated with triterpenoids and limonoids administered in artifi cial diet (n = 30).Means followed by the same letters within columns indicate no signifi cant difference (P  0.05) in the Tukey test.Compound or controlContent [mg kg -1 ]Larval phase duration [d] ( SD) aPupal weight [mg] aLarvae mortality (%) a1117.6 ( 1.25) a259.7 a10.0 b1018.0 ( 1.72) a255.7 a16.7 b5018.1 ( 1.43) a253.9 a40.0 aControl17.4 ( 1.39) a260.8 a6.7 b2118.2 ( 1.61) ab271.7 a13.3 a1018.7 ( 2.33) a271.6 a20.0 a5019.1 ( 1.67) a273.3 a26.7 aControl17.4 ( 1.39) b260.8 a6.7 a3118.2 ( 2.39) a262.6 a13.3 ab1018.5 ( 2.17) a263.9 a33.3 ab5019.3 ( 1.99) a266.6 a40.0 aControl17.4 ( 1.39) a260.8 a6.7 b4117.1 ( 1.97) ab264.5 a10.0 a1018.2 ( 2.06) a262.7 a10.0 a5018.5 ( 2.34) a269.5 a20.0 aControl17.4 ( 1.39) b260.8 a6.7 a5116.3 ( 3.03) ab247.8 ab23.3 ab1016.3 ( 1.97) ab245.3 ab20.0 ab5016.3 ( 1.18) a244.7 ab33.3 ab10017.5 ( 2.48) a236.7 b40.0 aControl14.9 ( 0.80) b262.5 a10.0 b6124.2 ( 4.25) a242.7 b20.0 ab1025.7 ( 3.71) a241.6 b33.3 ab5023.3 ( 4.41) a241.2 b53.3 aControl22.7 ( 3.00) a272.7 a10.0 b7116.6 ( 3.1) a246.2 a16.7 b1016.3 ( 3.1) a245.6 a40.0 b5016.2 ( 2.0) a235.3 b63.3 ab10016.0 ( 0.6) a238.3 b80.0 aControl14.9 ( 0.8) a262.5 a10.0 bUnauthenticatedDownload Date | 9/2/15 2:05 PMa
