NEOLIGNANS FROM ANIBA LANCIFOLIA *
The branches of the shrub Aniba lancifolia Kubitzki et Rodrigues (Lauraceae) contain besides 2hydroxy-4,5-dimethoxyallylbenzene and its dimer cyclohexan-2-allyl-5-en-4,5-dimethoxy-4-0-(2'-allyl-4',5'dimethoxyphenyl)-l-one (lancilin, 2) 6 further novel neolignans: (4S,2'R)-and (4R,2'E)-cyclohexan-2-allyl-2,5-dien-4,5-dimethoxy-4-[2'-(l'-guaiacyl)-propyl]-l-one (lancifolins A and B, 3a and 3b), (4S,2'R)-and (4R,2'R)-cyclohexan-2-allyl-2,5-dien-4,5-dimethoxy-4-[2'-(l'-vera~l)-propyl]-l-one (lancifolins C and D, 3c and 3d), (4S,2'R)-and (4R,2'R)-cyclohexan-2-allyl-2,5-dien-4.5-dimethoxy-4-[2'-(l'-piperonyl)-propyl]-l-one (lancifolins E and F, 3e and 31).

INFRODUCTIONAniba lancifofia Kubitzki et Rodrigues, to date known only from the type locality 130 km north of Manaus, is the sole species of its genus with shrubby habit and broadly cordate leaf bases. The rocky campina in which it was discovered would merit to be preserved as a relic, due not only to the very peculiar characteristics of its vegetation, but also to the wealth of endemic and rare species. Unfortunately, this area is at present being irreversibly destroyed, as many others in Amazonia [2].Branches of the shrub were found to contain a simple allylbenzene (la) together with 7 related compounds belonging to two novel neolignan types in which two allylbenzene units are linked either head to head by a 2.0.3' bridge (lanciiin type, 2) or tail to head by a 8.3' bridge (lancifolin type, 3).Systematic nomenclature, which we have used so far for neolignans (cf. [3] and previous papers), detracts from the fact that, in spite of diversity of skeletons and functions, they form a singularly homogeneous biogenetic group of natural compounds. This homogeneity is honoured in a system of nomenclature and numbering outlined in a recent review [4] which is adopted in the present paper.  The MS of all lancifolins  RESULTSby 'H NMR.

are para-related. Among the three possible alternatives, the meta-dimethoxy structure can be excluded by MS evidence. Intense M'-15 and M'-15-28 peaks are typical of ortho-and paradimethoxybenzenes[5]. From the remaining alternitives la was selected by analysis of the 'H NMR shifts upon acetylation which are closely comparable to analogous shifts for lb [6] (A6 la/lb: CH2 OH R20 la R'=R2=Me 1 b RI-R2 = CH, -O.l/-0.1, H-3 +0.33/+0.27, H-6 -0.08/-0.07). The recognition of 2-hydroxy-4,5-dimethoxyallylbenzene as a constituent of the species proved biosynthetically significant. Indeed, the additional constituent Ian&in (2), G2Ha0,,, is simply a dimer of la, as shown by the MS which, besides the M' peak (1% rel. int.), shows only peaks for the monomer ([C11H1403]+., formed by a 1,4-hydrogen rearrangement, lOO%), and by acid hydrolysis which leads only to la. This evidence is compatible with the formulation of Ian&in as the biogenetically reasonable ketal 2. 'H NMR data fully confirm this proposal and indicate the axial conformation of H-l' [S H-2' ax 1.68 (I, .I = 12 and 12 Hz), H-2' eq 2.2 (dd, J = 12 and 4 Hz)]. All further isolates can be considered oxidative coupling products of la with ethers of 3,4dihydroxypropenylbenzene.
