THE ISOFLAVONES OF PTERODON PUBESCENS*t
Pterodon pube$cens Benth. (Leguminosae-Lotoideae) is native to the savannahs of Central and Southern Brazil. The fruits contain geranylgeraniol, all-trans(-)-14,15epoxygeranylgeraniol,3 besides two additional diterpenes4 and alkaloids.5 The wood is suitable for joists and railroad ties.6 Fractional crystallization of its benzene extract yielded a new compound, in addition to 3 ',4',6,, which was synthesized7 prior to its isolation from the heartwood of Cordyla africana, and 2',6,7-trimethoxy-4',5'-methylenedioxyisoflavone (Ib, milldurone), a constituent of Cordyla africana* and of Millettia dura.9The IR and UV spectra showed that the new compound, CZ0HZ007, was an isoflavone. This indication was reinforced by the NMR spectrum which contained the signal at 2.05 r due to the isoflavonoid 2-H, and revealed the presence of 5 methoxyls and of 4 aromatic protons. The chemical shifts of two singlets (2.35, 3.10 T) allocated two of these protons to thepara-positions of ring A, while the chemical shifts and coupling constant of two doublets (3.25, 2.93 T, J 9.1 Hz) allocated the remaining two protons to the 5',  , m.p. 145-147". $z; (cm-'): 1658, 1631, 1608, 1490, 1484, 1264, 1096,1033, 884 793.

These values are comparable to reported data on other isoflavone-isoflavanone pairs,* and corroborate the analysis leading to constitution Ic. This is isomeric with the known 2',4',5',6,7pentamethoxyisoflavone (Id).* Indeed, the mass spectra of these compounds are very similar, both showing a strong M-31 peak which, in the case of isoflavones, is diagnostic of a methoxyl at C-2'. EXPERIMENTAL For experimental techniques see Ref. 10. Isolation of la, b and c. The ground wood (5.0 kg) was extracted with hot benzene. The benzene solution was evaporated and the residue was fractionally crystallized from EtOH, appearing in order of increasing soiubility Ib (205 mg), La (35 mg) and Ic (30 mg). 3',4',6',7-Tetramethoxyisofiavone (Ia) and 2',6,7-trimethoxy-4',5'-methylenedioxyisoflavone (Ib).

Direct comparison with an authentic sample of milldurone9 confirmed the identity of Ib. 2',3',4',6,7-Pentumethoxyisoflavone (Ic), m.p. 170-172" was obtained as fine colourless crystals from EtOH.
