Platymiscium praecoxMart. (Leguminosae-Lotoideae) is an arboreous species which occurs near Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Its trunkwood yielded a series of crystalline compounds which were classified by their spectra as a chalcone, three flavanones, two flavones, an isoflavone and four coumarins.The chalcone and one of the flavanones were identified with the well known 4,2',4'trihydroxychalcone (isoliquiritigenin) and ( f)-7,4'-dihydroxyflavanone (liquiritigenin)3 through direct comparison with synthetic samples.4*5 The spectral characterization of the second flavanone as (2R)-7-hydroxyflavanone was consubstantiated by direct comparison with synthetic ( i)-7-hydroxyflavanone.6-sThe PMR spectrum of the third flavanone included the pair of doublets typical of the AB system of vicinal protons at positions 2 and 3 of 3-hydroxyflavanones.g The B part of this signal was shifted paramagnetically by l-2 ppm upon acetylation of the compound, confirming the existence of a secondary carbinol. The remaining features of the PMR spectrum defined the substitution pattern of the aromatic rings and, in conjunction with * Part XXXVIII in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Leguminosae".

GOMLIEB MS and ORD data,'O led to the structure of (2S, 3S)-3,7_dihydroxyflavanone.Only SYnthetic (-J-)-3,7-dihydroxyflavanone has been described previously."The flavones were identified as 3,7_dihydroxyflavone and 3,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone by spectral means. The data obtained for these isolates and for the derived acetates are in agreement with the data reported for synthetic 3,7-dihydroxyflavone,12,13 as well as for synthetic'" and natural'5 3,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone.The PMR spectrum of its diacetate identified the isoflavone unequivocally with 6,7dihydroxy-4'"methoxyisofl atone (texasin), previously detected in Baprisia australis by PC." The isolate has a m.p. and gave UV and TR spectra as required by the literature for synthetic specimens.'7-19One of the four coumarins of P. praecox was identified with 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin (aesculetin dimethyl ether) isolated previously from plants. 20*Z1 The remaining three compounds were immediately recognized as unusual : their PMR spectra indicated in each case the presence of a C-methyl group. This fact, combined uith elementary, mass spectral and functional analyses, led to the formula C9H303 .CH, .0H.0CH3 for one of them. The hydroxyi must be placed at a position such as C-7, conjugated with the carbonyl, since upon methylation and upon acetylation a shift of the IR carbonyl stretching band from 1700 to 1725 cm-' was observed. Two of the three undefined hydrogens in the formula must be mefa-related and both vicinal to the hydroxyl. In the acetate they give rise to a pair of doublets (J 2.5 HZ) at a significantly lower field (7 3.  10 and 3.25) than in the methyl ether (2 proton singlet, T 3.40). The third hydrogen was placed at the 3 position of the heterocycle, in view of the relatively small chemical shift of its PMR signal [s, T 4-50 (methyl ether), 4.40 (acetate)]. At t.his point two structural alternatives (I and Ilb) had to be considered for the methyl ether. A synthetic sample of 5,7-dimethoxy-4to be different, upon direct comparison, with this derivative. Most significantly, the PMR signal due to the C-methyi group of the synthetic compound appeared as a doublet (T 7.48, J I.5 Hz) and the vicinal olefinic proton gave a quartet (T 4.06, J l-5 Hz), as in other coumarins and chromones of this type. In contradistinction, methyl substituted aromatics with a free ortho-position, usually show the methyl proton signal as a " W. GAFFIELD and A. C. WAISS, JR., Chem. Commrm. 29 (1968). I' T.
