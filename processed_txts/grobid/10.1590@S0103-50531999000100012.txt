20(R)-and 20(S)-Simarolide Epimers Isolated from Simaba cuneata -Chemical Shifts Assignment of Carbon and Hydrogen Atoms
Os quassinóides C25 20(R)-e 20(S)-simarolídeo foram isolados de Simaba cuneata, Sima- roubaceae. As estruturas destas substâncias foram caracterizadas por dados espectrais, incluindo espectros de RMN 1D e 2D que foram também usados para a completa atribuição dos deslocamentos químicos dos átomos de carbono e hidrogênio.The C25-quassinoids 20(R)-and 20(S)-simarolide were isolated from Simaba cuneata, Sima- roubaceae. The structures of these two compounds were characterized by spectral data, including 1D and 2D NMR spectra which were also used for the complete assignment of the carbon and hydrogen atom chemical shifts.

Introduction 20(R)-simarolide (1a), a C-25 quassinoid was first isolated from Simarouba amara. Its structural elucidation, including absolute stereochemistry has already been described in the literature 1,2 . The phytochemical study of a Simaba cuneata specimen has allowed the isolation of (1a) and its C-20 epimer (1b). The characterization of these two quassinoids was based on spectral data analysis, obtained from the diacetylated derivatives 2a and 2b, especially NMR [(1D: 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR-PND and 13 C-NMR-DEPT) and (2D: 1 H x 1 H-COSY, 1 H x 1 H-NOESY, HMQC and HMBC)]. The NMR data comparison of both compounds isolated from Simaba cuneata allowed the localization of an acetoxyl group at C-11 (1a and 1b, Table 1), and the correct assignment of the chemical shifts of all hydrogen (δ H ) and 13-carbon (δ C ) atoms of both diacetyl derivatives (2), 20(R)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2a) and 20(S)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2b).The presence of a carbonyl group at C-17 led us to discuss the possibility of 1b being the result of a C-20 epimerization (α carbon to the carbonyl group) of the major natural compound 20(R)-simarolide (1a), during the extraction and isolation processes. However, the bioproduction of 20(S)-simarolide still can not be discarded.
Results and DiscussionThe 13 C-NMR spectra signals of 2a and 2b (Table 1) corresponding to quaternary carbons [(C) 9 : two ketone carbonyls, four ester and lactone carbonyls and three Csp  3 . Based on small chemical shift differences observed between 2a and 2b we suggested that they were diastereomers.  ]}, combined with the δC and δH and the multiplicity of the hydrogen atom signals observed in the 1 H-NMR spectra (1D and 2D 1 H x 1 H-COSY), have allowed the structure of simarolide (1a), a quassinoid with twenty five carbon atoms (C 25 ) isolated from Simarouba amara 1 to be proposed. The relative stereochemistry of 1a was defined on the basis of X-ray analysis 1,2 . This is the first report of the complete NMR carbon and hydrogen assignment of 1a.The 1 H-NMR (Table 2) and  1 and2). These differences were confirmed by the comparison (Figure 3 and4) of the heteronuclear correlation spectra (HMQC) 4,5   4.34) in 2b. Therefore, it was possible to deduce that the two acetylated derivatives 2a and 2b differ only in the stereochemistry of the chiral carbon C-20. From HMQC spectra of 2a and 2b it was possible to assign all chemical shifts for both, hydrogen and hydrogenated carbon atoms (Tables 1 and2), also establishing the δH observed for CH-20 (2a: δH 4.31 (m); 2b: δH 4.30), which is surprising  -20)] revealed to be compatible with the parameters expected for δC in these structural conditions 3 . The unequivocal assignment of the δC of all 2a carbon atoms (Table 1) was assured by the analysis of the heteronuclear correlation bidimensional spectrum, HMBC. Therefore, for example, the spin-spin interactions of C-1 (δ C 206.60) with the 3H-19 [δ H 1.24 (Table 2), 3 J CH ] and C-17 (δ C 211.90) with the H-12ax [δ H 1.69 (Table 2), 3 J CH ] and the 3H-18 [δ H 0.98 (Table 2), 3 J CH ] have allowed the correct assignment of the chemical shifts for C-1 and C-17. Other long range correlations can be found in Table 1. Based on the correct assignment of C-1 (δ C 206.60) and C-17 (δ C 211.90), it was possible to reassign the chemical shifts for this structure and correct some data from the literature. So, the assignment of the δC of C-1 (δ C 214.17) and C-17 (numbered as C-22 in reference 6: δC 200.55) of the quassinoid (3) isolated from Picrasma javanica 6 should be corrected to C-1 (δ C 200.55) and C-22 = C-17 (δ C 214.17), as observed in the quassinoid (4) isolated from Picrasma ailanthoides 7 , since a solvent (pyridine-d 5 ) effect should not be responsible for such a modification. The comparison of the 13 C-NMR chemical shift for 2a and 2b also permitted the correct assignment of the 2b quaternary carbon δC (Table 1).With the unequivocal assignment of the δH for 2a and 2b through analysis of the HMQC spectrum (Tables 1 and2), the homonuclear correlation 1 H x 1 H-COSY has allowed the recognition of all spin-spin interactions of the hydrogen atoms, especially CH-20, CH 2 -21 and CH 2 -22 (Fig. 1). The spectrum of 2a revealed, not only the vicinal interactions, but also the coupling of H-21a [δ H 4.59 (t)] in W or M (zig-zag) 5 with H-22 [δ H 2.75 (m)], which was not observed in the spectrum of 2b (Fig. 1). This comparative analysis allowed the suggestion that the γ-lactone ring in 2a adopts a conformation in which the spin-spin coupling through syn periplanar four bonds with H-21a and H-22 is possible in a W or M geometry ( 4 J w-H,H ), not observed in 2b. The conformational behavior differences of the γ-lactone ring on both epimers (2a and 2b) can only be justified by a steric interference involving the C-ring and the CH 3 -18 and CH 3 -30 methyl groups. In fact, the most significant differences in the interatomic distances (Table 3), measured at the minimum energy conformation (2a: 102.95 kcal/mol; 2b: 100.49 kcal/mol) using the molecular modeling program -PCMODEL (version 3.0), involve H-20 and 3H-18 hydrogen atoms (2a: 3.867, 4.230, 5.120 Å, with a mean approximated value = 4.406 Å; 2b: 2.363, 3.583, 3.746 Å, with a mean approximated value = 3.231 Å); ∆Å = 4.406 -3.231 = 1.175 Å) and 2H-12 hydrogen atoms (2a: 3.804 and 5.000 Å, with a mean approximated value = 4.402 Å; 2b: 1.880 and 3.447 Å, with a mean approximated value = 2.663 Å; ∆Å = 4.402 -2.663 = 1.739 Å). These data were employed to show, as foreseen, that the epimerization of the CH-20 chiral carbon produces diastereoisomers with different energies and interatomic differences between H-20 and the hydrogen atoms bonded to carbons placed close to the chiral center.The 1 H x 1 H-NOESY dipolar interaction bidimensional spectra of 2a and 2b (Table 4) were used to confirm the trans junctions of the A/B and B/C rings and cis junctions of the B/δ-lactone and C/δ-lactone rings and their corresponding conformations. The interpretation difficulties observed for the spatial interactions (dipolar-dipolar coupling) due especially to the proximity of H-20 and H-21b absorption positions, involving CH-20, CH-21 and 2H-22 hydrogen atoms were attenuated by the calculation of the interatomic distances (Table 3). Therefore, it was possible to assume the existence of NOE's between H-20 (δ H 4.30) and H-12eq (δ H 2.49) and 3H-18 (δ H 0.98) of 2b, which were not observed in 2a (Table 3). Furthermore, in the 1 H x 1 H-NOESY spectrum of 2b, a dipolar interaction was observed between H-11ax (δ H 4.92) and H-22 (δ H 2.75), indicating spatial proximity of these two hydrogen atoms. As in the spectrum of 2a, the spatial proximity of H-21b (δ H 4.30) with H-12eq (δ H 2.49), 3H-18 (δ H 0.98) and 3H-30 (δ H 0.90) could also be assumed. These data were used to postulate the configuration 20(R)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2a) for the acetylated derivative of the major natural product (1a) and 20(S)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2b) of the minor natural product (1b). This proposal is in agreement with the specific rotation {2a: [α] D = -14.0° (c 0.8, CHCl 3 ); 2b [α] D = -19.2° (c 1.48, CHCl 3 )} and with biogenetic considerations, since Simarouba amara 1 , Picrasma javanica 6 , Picrasma ailanthoides 7 , are bioproducers of C 25 quassinoids with 20(R) carbon, and Simaba Table 2. 1 H-NMR data (400 MHz) of 1 (1a + 1b), 2a and 2b, obtained from spectra registered in CDCl3 and TMS as internal reference. * Homonuclear correlation ( 1 H x 1 H-COSY) of 2a and 2b in bidimensional spectra and Heteronuclear correlation (HMBC) of 2a and 2b, HMBC of 2a and 1 H x 1 H-NOESY were also used in the assignment of the hydrogen atoms chemical shift (δH). a superimposed signals.cuneata belongs to the same Simaroubaceae family. This biogenetic consideration reinforces the possibility of 1b being a product formed by an epimerization reaction that may have occurred during the extraction and isolation process, but still does not definitely rule out its biogenetic origin.Finally, the mass spectrum of 2a and 2b, obtained by electronic impact at 70 eV, has revealed the peak corresponding to the molecular ion (m/z 546, 1%), and the peaks with m/z 486 (29 %) as well as the peaks m/z at 427 (7 %) and 426 (16 %) Daltons (M-AcOH -AcO• and/or M-AcO• -AcOH, and M-AcOH-AcOH respectively). Other peaks classified as being important for the structural information can be found summarized in Scheme 1. The analysis of the mass spectrum can also be useful for investigations involving the study of crude extracts by GC/MS 8 .
Experimental
GeneralThe melting points were determined in a Microquimica MQRPF-301 digital model equipment with heating plate. The IR spectra were registered on KBr pellets in a Pelkin-Elmer spectrometer. The Bruker ARX-400 model spectrometer ( 1 H: 400 MHz; 13 C: 100 MHz) was used to obtain the 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR spectra, using CDCl 3 as solvent and TMS as internal reference. The low resolution mass spectra were obtained in a Fisons/Plataform DI/MS 2000 model operating at 70 eV. The specific rotation measurements [α] D were done in a Perkin-Elmer model 241 digital polarimeter, using 20 s intervals for each reading, averaging a total of ten measurements.

Plant materialThe aerial parts of Simaba cuneata St.Hill. were collected in January of 1993, in highway of Sol, Guarapari -ES, and were identified by Prof. Dr. José Rubens Pirani. The respective voucher can be found deposited in the Herbarium of the São Paulo University, Biosciences Institute -SP. The leaves, bark and branches were dried separately in a stove with a circulation of air at 30 °C and afterwards were milled in a Willey mill.
Extraction and isolation of the chemical constituentsThe branches (680 g) were extracted consecutively with hexane and methanol at room temperature. After distillation of the solvents were obtained, respectively, 2.1 g and 6.4 g of solid residues. The residue obtained from the MeOH extraction (~5.5 g) was submitted to droplet countercurrent chromatography in descendent mode, using CHCl 3 :MeOH:H 2 O (5:5:3 v/v) as solvent. The organic phase was mobile and the aqueous phase was stationary.After 56 h of analysis, 259 fractions, 13 mL each, were collected and divided into 8 groups based on the results from analytical TLC. The fraction 3 (789 mg) was submitted to chromatography on a silica gel column, under pressure, using CHCl 3 :MeOH (95:5 initial v/v) as eluent, with an eluting gradient till MeOH (100%). 20 fractions, 20 mL each, were obtained. The fractions 3 (420 mg) and 4 (120 mg) have supplied, respectively, the impure quassinoids 1a and 1b.
Acetylated derivationsThe fractions 3 (420 mg) and 4 (120 mg), previously described, were acetylated with acetic anhydride/pyridine (2:1), as usual, during 12 h. The acetylated derivatives 2a (395 mg) and 2b (8 mg) were obtained and purified by re-crystallization in MeOH. 20(R)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2a). m.p. > 280 °C.[α] D = -14.0° (c 0.8, CHCl 3 ). 13 C-NMR (100 MHz): Table 1 and1 H-NMR (400 MHz): Table 2.
