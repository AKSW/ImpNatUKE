NEOLIGNANS FROM OCOTEA CATHARINENSIS*
Bark, wood and leaves of Ocotea catharinensis contain respectively 10 (average yield 0.7%), 15 (average yield 0.004%) and one (yield 0.4%) neolignans of the bicyclo[3.2.1]octanoid and the hydrobenzofuranoid structural types, including the new rel-(

INTRODUCTIONPrevious work disclosed the presence in trunk bark of the tree Ocotea catharinensis Mez (Lauraceae) of the neolignans la, b, 2a, b, 3,4 and 5 [2]. Careful re-examination of the extract led to the quantification of the data and to the additional isolation of the neolignans 6a, b and &I (Table 1). Relatively much smaller quantities of the same compounds (except ab), in addition to Zc, 7aA and 8b were isolated from wood, while a considerable quantity of 7s was the sole neolignan located in leaves. Compounds 2c, 6b, 7a and 8b are described for the first time.
RESULTSThe bicyclo[3.  Canellin-C @a) and 5-methoxycanellin-C (2b) have both been found in 0. catharinensis [2] following previous isolation from Licaria canella [6] as well as L. rigida [7] and Aniba simulans [S] respectively. COSY, 13C-lH HETCOR and NOE experiments helped to confirm the structural assignments and only the previously reported C-Z/C-5 (2a) and C-7/C-2' (2b) NMR signals had to be interchanged. Both compounds have comparable specific optical rotations and hence possess identical absolute configurations. They are represented correctly by the formulas shown, since 2a was now also obtained by acid catalysed de-0-methylation of la. The novel neolignan 2c and canellin-C @a) differ solely by the orientation of the hydroxyl at C-6'. Indeed the most conspicuous discrepancies in the 'H NMR spectra of 2a and b vs 2c refer to the W-coupling (J= 1.3 Hz) H,,-2/H-6 observable only in the latter (Table 2). This requires the hydroxyl at C-6' in 2c to be directed towards the hexacycle.Compound 3 now obtained in crystalline form (mp 142-lW), was featured in the previous paper on 0. catharinensis [Z] only with respect to its relative configuration. The absolute configuration shown here is based on the fact that a negative Cotton effect for the transition n-k+ ([FJ,,,-5300) was observed for this neolignan  Neolignan 6a has been found in Ocotea veraguensis [9] and served as model compound in the structural determination of 6b. The sole relevant discrepancies in the 'H NMR spectra of the compounds are due to differences in aromatic substitution (Table 3). Furthermore, both compounds display negative Cotton effects for the benzenoid chromophores at ca 293 nm and hence must belong to the absolute configurational series shown in the formulae. Among the four hexahydrobenzofuranoid neolignans 8 isolated, only 7a is a new compound, 7bd have been 9 obtained previously from Aniba ferrea [ll], Licaria 2 armeniaca [12] and L. canella [6] respectively. Again MeO-3(Co],, 1 + 29 750) observed for this compound.MeO-5Neolignan ferrearin C @a) has been found previously in Oeotea aciphylla [S, 151 and served as model compound in the structural elucidation of 8b. The relevant spectral differences suggested the pair to constitute C-7 epimers (Table 4). Indeed NOESY experiments revealed the spatial proximity of H-78 and Me-88 as well as of H-78 and H-6:, (8s) and of H-7cr and H-8a as well as of Me-IS and H-6!, (8b). X-Ray diffraction crystallography of 8a (Fig. 2) revealed the cis-fusion of the rings. The stereochemistry of the formulae indicated in previous papers [8,15) must hence be revised accordingly.
EXPERIMENTALIsolation of the constituents of 0. catharinensis. For description of plant material see ref. [2]. Air-dried, powdered bark (1.2 kg), wood (5.9 kg) and leaves (3.2 kg) were percolated with petrol. The bark extract (50 g) was submitted to CC (silica gel, 300 g, petrol-EtOAc, 9: 1, frs of 200 ml). Frs 14-19 gave C, frs 2CL26 gave C, b and 8s. Frs 35-36 gave la, b, 2a, b, 3 and 5 (see ref. [2]) and frs 42-47 gave 4 (see ref. [2]). The wood extract (16 g) was submitted to CC (silica gel, WI g, petrol-EtOAc of indicated proportions, frs of 200ml). 4'-para-Bromobenzoate of la.

Compound lb was now obtained in crystalline form (mp 152-153"). The 400 MHz 'H NMR spectra (see Experimental) associated with COSY and NOE experiments helped to define some coupling constants which had remained undetermined at 60 MHz and to confirm the proposed relative configurations. Moreover, NOE experiments made it obvious that the H-4' and H-6 signals of la had to be interchanged. The definitive assignments of the carbinolic proton signals were confirmed by 'HNMR comparisons of la and b with the derived 4',6'-ditrichloroacetylisocyanates [la/la-TAI 6: 3.74/5.31 (H-4'), 4.66/4.63 (H-2'), 4.72/6.21 (H-6'); lb/lb-TAI 6: 4.28/5.78 (H-4'), 4.56/4.73 (H-2'), 3.98/5.38 (H-6')]. The derived 4'-para-bromobenzoates of la and b showed respectively negative and positive Cotton effects at the relevant wavelength ( [0]245 -35450 vs + 36 6501. Hence the chiralities at C-4' of la and b are respectively R and S *Part 94 in the series 'The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae'. For Part 93 see ref. [l].

[ 3 ]3and the absolute configurations of the compounds are as shown in the formulas. Indeed the oxidation of both la and b with dipyridine-chromium (VI) oxide gave the same compound lc, spectroscopically identical with a hydrolytic product of the naturally occurring Id [4]. The CD curve of the oxidation product shows a negative Cotton effect for the transition n-x* ([13]~~~ -5650) and hence Id, as well as la and b, sustain the 1'S'-bridge on the a-side of their molecules [S].
