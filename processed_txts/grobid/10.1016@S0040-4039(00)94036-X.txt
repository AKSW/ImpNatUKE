(37.7 ppm, Table 1). This can be explained by a shielding effect due to the "y-gauche like" relaticnship between the C-~-H and the5u,lOcr-oxirane ring in 2. Treatment of epoxide 5 with LDA and phenylselenyl bromide4 in dry THF at -78Oc followed by addition of hydrogen peroxide at room temp, furnished a product that upon acetylation was identical in all aspects with natural 2.  2) in combination with biogenetic considerations allowed postulation of structure 3a for epoxivellozin.-The fact that compound 3a occurs in the sameplantwith velloziolide -1 allows US to consider s as a possible biogenetic precursor for the former diterpenoid.   Twonew rosane diterpenes, epoxicorcovadin and epoxivellozin, have been isolated from Vellozia candida Mikan: their structures were stablished by spectroscopic data and chemical transformations. Vellozia candida Mikan grows on the hillside of Corcovado mountain and on the rocky mountains of the coast of State of Rio de Janeiro. We have previously reported the isolation of velloziolide (1)' and of three rosane diterpenes' from the hexane extract of the stem, roots and leaf sheaths of this plant. The present paper describes the structural eluci--p. 168-69Oc, [a]; 2 0.00 (c = 1.00 CHC13)13 possesses as a characteristic feature an a,?+unsaturated ketone moiety (vc= 0 at 1668cm-' and A:,"$" at 253 nm). The 'H NMR spectrum, in CDC13, showed signals for four tertiary methyl groups (0.98, 1.10, 1.18 and. 1.26 ppm), a methyl group of an acetate (2.09 ppm) and one tertiary vinyl group at 5.67 ppm ( UT, dd., J=17 and 10 Hz). The multiplet signal (3H) between at 4.98 and 5.31 ppm (CH2, m) corresponds to the methylene of the vinyl residue and the acetyl carbinolic proton. Two doublets at 5.9 (lH, J=9 Hz) and 7.45 ppm (lH, J=9 Hz) are due to the two olefinic protons u,3-conjugated to the carbonyl group, with the 3carbon linked to a quaternary carbon. Double irradiation experiments demonstrated that these two protons are mutually spin coupled. The absence of absorptions in the IR spectrum for hydroxyl groups and the presence of two singlet signals at 64.3 and 68.4 ppm in 13C NMR spectrum of 2b indicated that the remaining oxygen atom belongs to an epoxide function. These data, in combination with the comparative analysis of the proton noise decoupled and single frequence off-resonance decoupled 13C NMR spectrum (Table l), allowed expansion of the molecular formula C22H3004 A t0 (CO-CH=CH~) (CHOAC) (--cH=cH~) (c ---) (cj3 (CH) (CH~)~ (CH~)~ and to deduce the structure 2&, which was confirmed by chemical transformation. Thus, epoxidation of 4' -with m-CPBA at 10°C, in CH2Cl2, afforded the 5a,lOe.-epoxide 2 as the main product by attack of the bulky reagent from the less hindered u-face. Stereochemical assignment of the epoxy ring of 5 can be made by comparative 13 -C NMR analysis of 2 and 4. -Thus in 2&, c-8 appears at a more shielded position(32.7 ppn) than in 4
Epoxivellozin [i: C20H28C4; m.p. 142-4%; [c]F = + 14.9 (c= 0.77 CHC13) ] revealed in the IR spectrum the presence of a conjugated ketone (1630 -1 cm , broad band), hydroxyl (3420cm -1 , broad band), and vinyl (900 cm -3 groups. The UV spectrum presented bands at Xmax EtoH 228 and 291 nm, which EtOH were shifted to Xmax 229 and 338 nm after addition of one drop a NaOH solution, indicating the presence of a diosphenol chromophore.' Table 2 lists the 1 H NMR spectral data of 3b assigned to the cor-responding protons by integration, multiplicity and nuclear magnetic double resonance techniques. The smaller value of the coupling constant of one of th'a protons at C-14 (J= 2.5Hz) indicatesits equatorial position (W-type coupling with Heq-12). The presence of two hydroxyl group was confirmed by acetylation of 3a (Ac20/DMAP) to yield a diacetyl derivative -3b showing two methyl singlets at 2.02 and 2.24 ppm (acetyl groups) and a double doublet at 5.24 ppm which corresponds to a carbinolic proton deshielded _by acetylation (4.04 ppm in 3). The UV spectrum of 3b showed --XEtOH max at 252 nm. The hypsochromic shift observed in the conversion of 3a to 3b confirmed the presence of the diosphenol chromophore in 3a.5 ---The re-naining oxygen atom in 3a was assigned to a tetrasubstituted epoxide moiety on the basis of 13c NMR peaks observed at 66.9 (s) and 72.3 (s) ppm. Reduction of 3b with NaBH4 in MeOH at room temp gave mono acetate (3~) (XzizH 228 and 291 nm). The l3 C NMR spectral data of 3a -and 3b (Table
