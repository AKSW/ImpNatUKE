REARRANGED LIMONOIDS FROM KHAYA SENEGALENSIS
The stems of Khaya senegalensis yielded three limonoids which appear to be novel. These compounds were identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis as methyl lct,6,8a,14fl,]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate; methyl 1 t~,2fl,3ce,6,8a,14/3-hexahydroxy-[4.2.1 l°'3°.11'4]-tricyclomeliac-7oate and methyl ~c~-acet~xy-2~3a~6~8ct~4~-pentahydr~xy-[4.2.~°~3°.~1~4]-tri~yc~me~iac-7-~ate. The two latter ones represent a novel group of methyl tricyclomeliac-7-oates. Scopoletin, scoparon, sitosterol, stigmasterol, Campesterol and 3fl-O-fl-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol were also isolated.

INTRODUCTIONThe genus Khaya A. Juss. is the main source of African mahogany, and is closely related to the South American genus Swietenia, the original source of mahogany. Khaya senegalensis (Desr.) A. Juss occurs in the sub-Saharan savannah area from Senegal to Uganda [1]. However, this was introduced in Brazil and showed excellent growth. As part of a continuing study of the chemosystematic of the Meliaceae we have now undertaken a further investigation of stems of exotic K.senegalensis. Here, we reported the isolation of three new limonoids, two of which represent a no~el group of methyl tricyclomeliac-7-oates.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA dichloromethane-soluble fraction of the methanol extract of the stems of K. senegalensis was purified by repeated column chromatography on silica gel and preparative TLC to give 3fl-O-~-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol and three new limonoids 1, 2 and 3.The major compound was identified as 1 on the basis of the following data. The ~H NMR spectrum (Table 1) indicated the presence of three tertiary methyl groups (8 0.99, 1.11 and 1.33), one methoxyl singlet (8 3.66), three downfield shifted signals attributable to a tsubstituted furan ring (8 7.59, 7.56 and 6.47), three signals characteristic of protons attached to a carbon *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.adjacent to an oxygen atom (8 5.40 s; 4.37 d, J= 10.3 Hz; 4.22 dd, J = 8.0 and 5.0 Hz) and two isolated AB-type methylenes, suggesting the presence of a methyl 1,29-cyclomeliacate skeleton [2][3][4]. From the ~H-~3C long-range correlation spectrum (Table 2) the observed correlations between the methyl proton at 8 0.99 and the 13C signals at 8 206.5 (3j) and 49.3 (2j) led to their assignments as C-28, C-3 and C-4, respectively. The methyl proton at 8 1.33 showed long-range correlation with the ~3C signal at 8 83.6 (3j). The oxymethine proton at 8 4.37 was coupled to the 1H signal at 8 2.88 and both signals also showed cross peaks with the ~C signal at 8 83.6 (3j and 2j, respectively), so placing the secondary hydroxyl substituent at C-30 and a tertiary hydroxyl substituent at C-I. The signals at 8 1.33 and 2.88 were then assigned to C-19 and H-2, respectively. The oxymethine proton at 8 4.22 showed one-bond correlation with the ~3C signal at 8 70.0 and was coupled to the tH signal at 8 3.25, which showed long-range correlation with the C-4 signal (8 49.3) and the ~3C signal at 8 70.0, thus indicating the hydroxyl group to be located at C-6 and permitting the assignment of the signal at 8 3.25 to H-5. A hydroxyl group must also be connected at C-8 due to the observed correlation between the H-2 signal (8 2.88) and the 13C signal at 8 86.8. These correlations resulted in the construction of a 1,6,8,30-tetrahydroxy-3-oxo-tricyclo-[3.3.11°'2.1 l'4]-decane system.The large geminal coupling constant of the C-15 methylene protons was consistent with their situation a to a carbonyl group with C-14 fully substituted. This was supported by the long-range ~H-a3c COSY, which The stereochemistry suggested for 1 was based on the biosynthesis of limonoids [5]. However, for C-30 the stereochemistry has been assigned by chemical conversions from known limonoids [2,6]. In a comparable compound, xylocarpin (4), the stereochemistry of the oxide was assigned by a study of the alkaline hydrolysis and subsequent methylation [2]. Two products were obtained, one of which was 5, in which ,/2.3o was 10 Hz (B 4.43 d, H-30). Inspection of a model for product 5 showed that after opening of the lactone ring, it is possible for the alkoxyl ion produced at C-17 to open an 8a,30a-oxide ring by attack at C-30, forming a six-membered ether ring and an 8a-hydroxyl-group. A similar attack is stereochemically impossible in a floxide. Thus, these observations allowed Okorie et al. to suggest that, in xylocarpin, H-30 is fl and the oxide ring a, in which J2.3o is 3 Hz [2].Based on the above evidence, in compound 1 the coupling constant between H-30 and H-2 (8 4.37 d, J = 10.3 Hz) is characteristic of 30fl-oxygenated methyl meliacate derivatives, as in 5. A model shows that, in 1 and 5, ring B is nearer to a boat than to a chair conformation, in which H-2 and H-30a are eclipsed. For 1 this was supported by NOESY experiments (Table 3), which showed correlations of the signal of H-30a (8 4.37) with the signals of H-2 (8 2.88) and H-15fl (82.69). In addition, the signal of H-15tz (8 3.10) showed cross peaks with the signal of H3-18 (8 1.11), suggesting a spatial proximity of H-15a to H3-18, which requires the hydroxyl group at C-14 to be anti (fl) to H3-18 (a). The correlations from H-17 (8 5.40), H-5 (8 3.25), H3-18 (8 1.11) and H-9 (8 2.28) to the signals at 8 1.77-1.83 permitted the assignments of H-12fl (H-17fl and H-5fl--~H-12B) and H-11t~ (H-9a and Mea-18-->H-11a) at 8 1.77-1.83. Moreover, the existence of a correlation from H3-19 (8 1.33) to the signal at 8 1.90, showed that this signal can be attributed to H-11fl and thus the signal at 8 0.85 corresponds to H-12tz. All these correlations require rings C and D nearer to chair conformations. These conclusions were supported by several NOEDIF experiments (Table 4). Moreover, the nOes of the hydroxyl proton at 8 5.19, coming from H3-18 and H-15a, allowed the assignment of this signal to 8-OH, also showing that the hydroxyl group is thus in the a-configuration. In the same way, the nOes of the hydroxyl proton at 8 4.89, coming from H3-19 and H-29b, show that this signal can be attributed to the 1 a-OH.The assignment of the stereochemistry of C-30 received further support from acetylation of 1, which yielded la. The ~H NMR spectrum of la (Table 1) showed the downfield shift of the signal for H-6 (8 5.13), while the signal for H-30 was still visible as a the second acetoxyl group to be located at C-1. This is consistent with the stereochemistry for C-l, the least hindered tertiary hydroxyl group of the molecule.Approach of reagents appears to be accessible only from the least hindered side of the molecule, since Adesogan et al. also showed that acetylation of the 3/3,30t~-dihydroxymexicanolide derivative (6) (85.35 d, J=3.6Hz, H-30/~), catalysed by 4-dimethylaminopyridine, gave a 30-monoacetate, leaving the 3fl-hydroxyl-group unacylated [6].As a further confirmation of the stereochemistry of 1, a NOESY experiment was obtained for la (Table 3). The new natural product is, therefore, methyl 1 t~, 6, 8ct, 14fl, 30fl-pentahydroxy-3-oxo-[3.3.1 lo.2.1 L4]. tricyclomeliac-7-oate (1). The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the ~3C NMR spectrum with those of chukrasin A and mexicanolide [7].Compound 2 showed spectral characteristics close to those of 1. The principal change observed in the ~3C NMR spectrum (Table 5) of 2 was the replacement of the resonance for a ketonic carbonyl by a signal for an oxymethine (8 78.2). The ~H-~H COSY spectrum, in addition to correlation between H-6 and H-5, revealed two more oxymethine protons (8 4.28 and 3.21) which Assignments based on H-C COSY/ H-C LRCOSY for I and HMQC/HMBC and 2.for la were coupled to each other and only one (6 4.28) to a methine proton (6 2.48). These observations could not be explained by the presence of hydroxyl groups at C-3 and C-30, indicating that we were not dealing with a normal 1,3,30-trihydroxy-l,29-cyclomeliacate skeleton, tficyclo-[3.3.11o.2.1 l'4]-decane system. A pinacol pinacolone rearrangement of a 2,30-dihydroxy-3-oxo-l,29-cyclomeliacate precursor and subsequent reduction may have occurred, resulting in a tricyclo-[4.2.11°'3°.1L4]-decane as in 2, whose spectroscopic properties accord with the above data. The signals at 6 4.28, 3.21 and 2.48 were then assigned to H-2, H-3 and H-30, respectively. The NOESY experiments (Table 3) showed correlations between H-30 and 2H-15 (6 2.86, H-15a, a weak, but definite correlation; 2.63, H-15fl). This implies that the bridge-head proton and 2H-15 are close to each other in space and demonstrate that the tricyclo is [4.2.11o.3o.1 L4]-decane and not [3.3.11°'2.11A]-decane, since in 1 these protons are not close.The NOESY experiments also showed correlations of H-5 with H-3 and of H-30 with H-2, which require a trans-relationship for H-3 and H-2, with H-3 on the t-side and H-2 on the a-side of the molecule. This is consistent with the coupling constants between H-3 and H-2 (J = 7.2), and between H-2 and H-30 (J = 9.2), in which the rearranged six-ring is nearer to a boat conformation where H-2 and H-30 must be eclipsed. Moreover, the observed correlations of H-21 and H-17 and H3-18, and H-23 with H-22, were very similar to those of 1 and la, except that H-23 (6 7.62) is more deshielded than H-21 (6 7.58). In the same way, HMQC experiments showed that C-21 (6 143.2) is more deshielded that C-23 (6 141.2). The structure of the new natural product was thus established as methyl 1 a,2fl, 3a,6, 8t~, 14fl-hexahydroxy-[4.2.11°"3°.11'4]-tficyclomeliac-7-oate (2). The third compound exhibited similar NMR spectra to 2 (Tables 1 and5) except for the presence of a tertiary acetoxyl (6 c 170.4, 22.0 and 6 n 1.97). Significant upfield shifts for C-29 and C-30 in the 13C NMR spectrum, when compared with 2 and la, determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-1. Thus, the structure of the new limonoid was characterized as methyl la-acetoxy 2fl,3a,6,8a,14fl-pentahydroxy-[4.2.11o.3o. 1 l'4]-tficyclomeliac-7-oate (3).The dichloromethane extract from the stem of K.senegalensis gave a mixture of sterols and two coumarins, which were identified by comparison with published data as scopoletin and scoparon [8]. The mixture of sterols was acetylated and analysed by GC-mass spectrometry, which established that the sterols were sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol.As reported in previous papers [5,9] species of Khaya explore limonoid chemistry along only one route, which leads to the mexicanolide group, bicyclo-[3.3.11°'2]-nonane system. This appears to be the first record of limonoids with a tficyclo-[3.3.11°'2.11'4]-decane system from Khaya, while 2 and 3 represent further enlargement of the biosynthetic mexicanolidepathways.EXPERIMENTAL NMR: on a Bruker ARX 400, on a Bruker ACF 200 and on a Varian Gemini 300, with TMS as int. standard; GC-MS: low resolution on a HP-2576 instrument; MS: 70 eV, direct probe insert and elevated temp.

Ground stems (600 g) was extracted with hexane, then CH2C12 and finally with MeOH. The conc. CH2CI 2 extract was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. Frs 1-3 gave a mixt. of sterols, fr. 5 gave scoparon (17 mg) and ft. 6 gave scopoletin (20rag). The coumarins were purified by prep. TLC (silica gel, EtOAc-hexane, 3 : 2). The mixt. of sterols was acetylated with Ac20pyridine prior to analysis by low resolution GC-MS, which established that the sterols were sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol. The conc. MeOH extract was partitioned into CH2C12-, EtOAc-and n-BuOHsoluble frs. The conc. CH2CI 2 extract was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with a hexane-CH2C12-EtOAc-MeOH gradient afforded a mixt. of limonoids and 3 fl-O-fl-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol (40mg). The mixt. of limonoids was repeatedly chromatographed on silica gel (hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient; hexane-CHzCI2-MeOH, 2: 18: 1) yielding, after final purification by TLC (hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 4:16:1), compounds 1 (70mg), 2 (17 mg) and 3 (5 mg).  Acetylation of compound 1. Compound 1 (10 mg) in Ac20 (0.5 ml), pyridine (0.3 ml) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (2 mg) was stirred for 10 hr at room temp. and then the mixt. was poured into H20. The reaction product (la) was extracted with CH2C12: amorphous solid (7 mg). ~H NMR (400 MHz, CDC13): see Table 1; 13C NMR (100MHz, CDC13): see Table 5; HMBC (400/100MHz, CDCI3): see Table 2; NOESY-TPPI (400MHz, CDCI3): see Table 3.
