We htave prevlourly reported (1) the laolation from ADhi nerlt of the polyketlde gluoosides nerlaphln (I), 6-hyd.ro~u818ln-8-_~-D-gluoo8~de (Iv), gluooside B (VIII), fluoraphln (X), and aoetjlfluoraphln (XI). An additional 8~11 fraotlon of the polar pigments In the aphid extraot h68 now b6en rhown w llwR upeotrometry to oonsirt of a 211 mixture of the 6'-monoaoetJrl-gluoo8lde8 II and V; this mixture ~88 unohanged under oondltionn whloh gave a good yield of a 6'monotrltylate from nerlaphin (I) (2). An interrelation of 6-hydroxymu8icln (VI) with the plant produot toraohrysone (VII) (3) wm8 alro aooompll8hed through partial nethylation of the gluoo8lde (IV) followed by aold hydrolj818 (2). A8 elegant total synthesis of 6-hjdroxymU818in it8elf ha8 reoentlj been aohieved m This latter speotrua strongly auggeated the preuenoe of a 281 alxture of the oonjugated nethjlene-healaoetal aoetate XVII aad the vlnfl ether XVIII resulting from l,&addltlon of aoetlo aoid. Clarifloatlon of the indloated NMR assignmsnts and of the nature of the mixture was greatly aided by the use of sjnthetio model oompounds, reported in the followlng S~unlOatiOn (9). AOetylatiOn of XIV apparently gave but two produots (not yet fully purified), one oorresponding to XVI and the other (XIK) to XVIII, unmixed with XVII-aMlOgOU8 lraterial.The possibility that XIII and XIV might be artefaots produoed upon Florisil ohromatography of the orude aglyoone-oontaining aphid extraots (1) oould be ellninated by the observation of their presenoe prior to ohronwitography In fresh extraots of A. neril feeding on either Aeoleolas ouraasavioa or Nerium oleander, and their deteotion on thin-layer plates in whloh live aphids were dlreotly orushed on the origin. These oompounds thus represent two of the very few known natural produots (10) olearly related in part to biaoetyl, rather than only to aoetate units joined normally head-to-tail.6Flori811 and 8illoa of the aOetOne ertnOt of a large batoh (405 g.) of A~hl8 neril (prepared by Dr. Brent Aoott in Tuowa, Arizona) yielded tnroe amount8 of two additional oompound8, 6a8lly deteoted and followed on thin-layer plate8 by their brilliant red fluore8oenoe.6* The8e Pre86nted in part, lnoludlng 8truotur6 XIV, by U.

H The pr68enoe of larg6r amount8 of th6ae two oompound8 wa8 oonfirmbd in a 86OOnd large 6xtraot of 4. nerl& prepared in Tuo8on in 1971 by l&vld Eokert. 3501 oompound8, XIII b.p. 116-122°(n8011difie8 and m. 215-218' dao.), eg= 216,244, 298,412 M (log c 4.59,4.65,4.45,4.28),~~$ 1700,1645,1600 om.-l] and XIV [a.~. 180-186o, *;= 216,240,297,395 nm (log c 4.63,4.56,4.58,4.25),v~ 1680.1650, 1600,1560 om. -11 were not redu oed by aqu8ou8 8odlum dlthlonlte, but gave upon borohjdrlde reduotion material (not laolated) with W l b8orptlon rpootrum 0108olf aatohlng that of gluoo8lde B (VIII). Their dlagno8tlo MHR rpeotr8 (indloated l long8ide their 8tl'tlOtIlre8, In &value8 below Internal TM& in CDC13 8olutlon) 8howed that the7 were derived from neriaphlgenln (III) and 6&@roqru8lcln (VI), r88peotlvely, by modifloatlon of the re8oroinoid ring only, elitinatlng one aroautlo proton and leaving the other In a more highly 8hielded po8itlon, and intFOduoing two derhlelded quaternary C-methyl group8 with very dlfferent lugnet10 en-ViX'OnlWnt8. The oompound8 oould not be methylated rlth dla8oaeth8n8, but rti11 po88e88ed a 8tro!@Jr hydrogen-bonded phenollo groUp (&beXOhU&WbltI mn 81gna1 n8ar 14 ppm, and 8hlft of the W 8peotrum upon alkallnl%ation). The ma88 8peotra of the two oompound8 revealed the addition of 68 Y88 unit8 to the aglyooner III and VI (M+ 274+342, 232+300); th8 only rlgniflourt fragmentatlonr fore 1088 of methyl. and/or hydroxyl group8 and water from the very sta-b18 moleoular 1On8. The foregoing faot8 oan bert be aooommodated by po8tulating a oondewation of the aglfoone8 with MaoetY&, uith elimination of water (CqE602=86, -E2ol68). PO8itiOn 5 in oompound8 of thi8 m i8 knOUn t0 be highly ruOtiVe to-ward8 oondan8atlon8 with eleotron-poor aa (6,7). The re8ultlng 8tNOtU%8, written a8 healaoetals (XIII,XIV), are uniquely oon818tent ulth the phj818al and ohemlorl dati aoolraulsted 80 far on the8e redfluore8oent entltlerr.

The tuo natural oompound8 XIII and XIV, and their analog XV [m.p. 180-185° deo., %FxH 221.298.404 nm (log t 4.53, 4.43,4.ll),V~ 1645,158O om"] were produoed by th8 rrpld, rooctemprrrture oonden8ation of one mole of blaostyl with the orude aglyoon88 III, VI, and IX (from aold hydro48ir of I, IV, and VIII), in the preronoe of Florlsll or triethylamine (yield8 about 50s). The 8fnthetlO 68terlal8 XIII and XIV war8 in 8vcry nay identloal ulth those Uolated from the aphid extraota. Thounwual doubling of tiW8t all puk8 In ths H?Ul 8peOtl'a Of XIII and XV WY k re1at8d to 8108 lntemonver8lon of two oonformer8 of the dlhydropynn ring, or to dia8tereol8ome* Iam due to the hemlaoetal oarbon; a solution of XIII In totraohloroothjlono &owed partial ooale8oonoe of them doubled peak8 In the 6peOtrUa aumred at 11S"o(2). Hild aoetylation of XIII (Ao201gy, r.t.) gave a prlnolpal (70$) prodtrot Xvf, Ip. Q. 188-195', with a slmpllfled NHE rpeotrum (lndloated berlde EtrUOtUre), negUglble fluoreeoenoe, and a UV apeotrua nearly ldentloal uith that of peraoetyl-I (1). The maaes speotrum of this oompound &owed It to be trlaoetylated; the lnfmred speotrua reveeled only phenol10 aoetate groups, and an unsaturated ketone bmd of greater Intensity than that of the parent XIII. This prlnolpal produot ha6 evidently undergone the re-aromatization frequently observed in qulaone a&hider (8); In view of lte W apeotral oharaoterl~tlos, It should have the unsaturated ketone sldeohaln at C-5 twlated out of oonjugatlon with the aroaatlo ring by aterlo pre8mare from the nelghborlng aoetoxy group. The aoetplation of XIII gave, beaIde XVI, an lneeparrble mixture of two trlaoetates with very strong yellow-white fluoreaoenoe. The W apeotrua of thlm mixture lndloated addltlonal oonjugatlon to the ammatlo system; an allptmtlo aoetoq group uaa evident from the IE wFx 1735 or."), aa8a (H+ -59), and UNR speotra.
