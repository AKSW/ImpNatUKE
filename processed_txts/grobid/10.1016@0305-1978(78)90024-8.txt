Chemosystematic Implications of Flavonoids in Aniba riparia*
The trunk wood ofAniba riparia (Nees) Mez (Lauraceae) contains flavokawin-B, (2S)-pinostrombin, (2S)-5, 7-di-O-methylpinocembrin, (2R, 3R)-5, 7-di-O-methylpinobanksin, izalpinin and 3, 5, 7-tri-O-methylgalangin. Structural comparison of these flavonoids with the pyrones and neolignans, which characterize all previously examined Aniba spp., leads to a chemical classification of the genus.

IntroductionThe production of secondary metabolites in Aniba species is based mainly either on un-, mono-and di-oxygenated benzoic and cinnamic acids or on di-and tri-oxygenated cinnamic acids. The former group of precursors (+2 acetate units) leads to the pyrones (1) typical of Group 1 of Aniba species, and the latter group of precursors (via reduction to propenyl-and allylphenols) leads to the benzofuranoid neolignans (2) typical of Group 2 of Aniba species (Table 1 ) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14].So far neither pyrones nor neolignans have been isolated from A. riparia (Nees) Mez [ 1 5].While the presence of benzyl benzoate, a nearly ubiquitous Aniba constituent [2], is consistent with the inclusion of this species in the genus, the isolation of 3, 5, 7-tri-Omethylgalangin (4d), based on an unsubstituted cinnamic acid (even if +3 acetate units) seems to point to the affinity of A. riparia to Group 1. Indeed, in A. rosaeodora, which belongs to this group, pyrones are associated with pinocembrin (5a) [16] and rubranine (6), the sole additional flavonoids known to occur in the genus. The suspicion that rubranine is an artifact [1 7] can be dismissed, it is extractable by washing a wood sample with hexane for a few seconds at room temperature [18]. Are pyrones associated with tri-Omethylgalangin in A. riparia? This question, which is relevant to define the precise chemosystematic position of the species, cannot be answered on the basis of the data presented in the previous study [15], which concerned only the structure of the most abundant compound (4d) of the extract. The mother liquor from the isolation of 4d has now been examined in detail.  The compounds represented by the formulae 4, 5, 7 and 8 represent all known natural members of these flavonoid types. Their occurrence is rather restricted. Members of all types were reported only for Pinus, Aniba and A/pinia (Table 2), thus indicating the proximity of Magnoliidae-Liliidae with respect to typical, primitive Pinopsida flavonoids. Pyrones again occur in Aniba and A/pinia (Table 2).
Results
NoAn exceptionally strong chemical relation exists between Aniba and Piper species with respect to flavonoids (5a: A. [1 6]; 5c: P. [22]; 7c: A. 8"P. [22]), pyrones (la, n = I:A. [28] P. [22]; la, n = 1, 5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro: A.[5] 8 P. [28]), neolignans (2: A. [37]; 9: P. [38]) and even cinnamamides (3: A. [14]; 10: P. [39]).
Experimental/so/at/on of the Constituents ofAniba riparia. The crystallization liquor (40 g) of 4d [14] was extracted with 3% aq. NaOH and the aq. soln. separated from an oil (19 g). The aq. soln. was taken with HCI to pH 8 and extracted with Et=O. The Et20 soln. was evap. and a portion (1.4 g) of the residue (12.8 g) separated into light petrol soluble and insoluble parts. The soluble part (1.1 g) was crystallized from MeOH to give 4c (1 g). The insoluble part (0.3 g) was separated by fractional crystallization from MeOH into 5b (200 mg) and 7c (50 mg). A portion of the oil (4.3 g) was separated into light petrol soluble and insoluble parts. The soluble part (3 g) was chromatographed on a dry column (115 g silica, C,Hs) to give fatty material (1 g), benzyl benzoate (500 mg), sitosterol (250 mg) and a mixture separated by fractional crystallization from MeOH into additional quantities of 5b (200 mg) and 7c (20 mg). The insoluble part (1.3 g) was separated by fractional crystallization from MeOH into an additional quantity of 4d (1 g) and a mixture (250 mg). The mixture was separated by TLC (silica, C6H6-EtOH 97:3) into 5d (200 mg) and 8¢ (9 mg).(2R, 3R)-3-Hydroxy-5, 7-dimethoxyflavanone (8c), m.p. and lit.

Instead, not surprisingly in view of their biosynthetic relation with 4d, izalpinin (4c)[19], (2S)-pinostrombin (5b)[20], (2S)-5, 7-di-O-methylpinocembrin (Sd)[21], flavokawin-B (7c)[22] and (2R, 3R)-3-hydroxy-5, 7-dimethoxyflavanone (8c) were isolated. Atl compounds were identified by UV, IR, 'H NMR, MS, and, in the cases of 5b, 5d, 8c, ORD curves[23,24], and had m.p.s, indicated in the literature. The dihydrofiavonol 8c was previously only known as the synthetic 5
