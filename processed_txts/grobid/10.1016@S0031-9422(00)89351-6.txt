INTRODUCTIONAt the outset of the present studies on Lauraceae species, the presence of an orange product in Aniba rosaeodora Ducke was reported [2]. Later named rubranine,its structural elucidation relied on spectral data, complemented by acid isomerization la -+ 2a [3], 3 and 4 [4], as well as syntheses involving pyridine-catalysed condensation of citral and either phloroacetophenone (followed by aldol condensation of the resulting product lc with benzaldehyde) [3, 51 or pinocembrin (5a) at 160". At 100" the latter reaction gives 6 and 7 which at 180" yields rubranine (la). Spectral evidence being incompatible with the existence of unchelated hydroxyl and carbonyl functions. structure 8 cannot represent either of the intermediates, invalidating structure lb for rubranine [6].The distinction between la and lb is impossible on spectral grounds [3, 63. Even acid isomerization, on which the original structural proposal la was based [3], lost weight as a decisive argument with the isolation of 4. This was postulated to arise from la by opening of both benzylic ether bonds, rotation of 180" about the Ar-C bond and ring closure [4]. The formation of compounds 2a and 3 could, of course, be rationalized through an analogous sequence of events starting from lb.With regard to acid isomerization, it may be relevant to mention that rubranine (la), as well as racemic pinocembrin (5a) [8], were obtained from rosewood by a process [3] which involved extraction with boiling benzene and repeated washings of the solution with dilute HCl in order to separate anibine (9a) [2]. The rubranine was found to be optically inactive and this fact, as well as the absence of citral in the wood was explained postulating anibine-catalysed scavenging of citral by  during extraction, Indeed, racemic rubranine was formed in excellent yield when the compounds were heated, presumably in benzene, to reflux temperature [3].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrior to examination of the possibility of artifact formation we wanted to confirm the structure of our (-)-rubranine.An analytical means of differentiating between the structures la and lb, an alternative to acid isomerization, consists of pyrolysis. Lack of colour and the UV spectrum of the product indicated that the original chalcone chromophore had been isomerised to a flavanone type. In spite of its chromatographic behaviour (one TLC spot) and sharp mp. the product was a ca 1 :l mixture of two compounds, both showing a chelated hydroxyl (r -2.23, -2.19). The derivatives were represented as the linear isomers 2a and 2b, rather than the angular ones, on account of a strongly positive Gibbs test [lo]. Although this evidence is not completely reliable, due to the possibility of ring opening under the conditions (pH 9.2) of the test, the presence of both the linear and the angular isomers in this mixture is unlikely, in view of the sharpness of the PMR signal of the lone aromattc proton. Both derivatives, 2a and 2b, contain vinylic methyls (z 8.1). No such groups, of course, could be generated from lb whose pyrolysis should yield a 5-hydroxyflavanone with an exocyclic vinyl group ( 12). Confirmation of this reasoning was obtained upon hydrogenation of the pyrolytic product, Again a mixture of two compounds resulted. These, however, could be separated by chromatography on silica gel into a 5-hydroxyflavanone (Zc) and a 2',6'-dihydroxydihydrochalcone (13). As expected both contain one quaternary (T 8.7, singlet) and two tertiary (r 8.8 and 9.3, doublets) methyls. Hydrogenation of 12 would have led to a compound possessing one tertiary and two quaternary methyls.As already pointed out, however, the safest means of structural confirmation is the synthesis of rubranine by condensation of citral with pinocembrin in pyridine. Having satisfied ourselves with respect to the structure of (-)-rubranine.experiments were designed to show the feasibility of in rim formation of the citrylidene system via condensation of geraniol and a phloroglucinol ring. In spite of the mildness of the chosen conditions, aqueous citric acid [ 121, phloroglucinol itself proved unsatisfactory as a model substrate. All 3 products, 16% 16b and 17a obtained besides derivatives of geraniol [13]. showed that the initial alkylating step had been followed by acid-catalysed cyclization. In order to produce the chromene intermediate of a citrylidene system, however, oxidative cyclization of the geranylphenol is required. The tendency for acid-catalysed cyclization can be diminished, using the less reactive phloroacetophenone as substrate. In this case. besides the two cyclized derivatives 16c and 17b. geranylphloroacetophenone (18) was obtained. This compound had already been prepared previously and oxidized with DDQ in refluxing benzene into the chromene 14c [4]. At room temperature under reported conditions [14], we also succeeded in separating from the reaction product the isomeric chromene, 14d and a mixture of the citrylidene derivatives lc and Id The components of the mixture were identified easily, having been obtained previously : lc (debenzylidenerubranine) by alkaline degradation of rubranine [3] or by heating of 14c in pyridine [4]. and ld by acid treatment of 14~ [4]. The surprising ease of production of these citrylidene derivatives, either during the oxidation reaction of geranylphloroacetophenone proper or during chromatographic separation of the products, favours the opinion that an analogous process may justify the biosynthesis of rubranine (la) from pinocembrin Oxidation of 5b with DDQ in benzene at room temperature [14] gave the expected chromene 6, a proven intermediate of rubranine synthesis [6]. Acid treatment of 6 was not optimized for obtaining rubranine.Under the rather vigorous conditions used, 3, the major product of acid isomerization of rubranine [3,4] was produced directly. In conflict with the statement that rubranine is an artifact [3] are the following observations : (1) ( -)-rubranine can be isolated by washing A. rosaeodora wood for a few seconds at room temperature with hexene or benzene. (2) Citral does not accompany linalool and geraniol in A. rosaeodora. The same is true, however, for A. duckei Kosterm. [7], a species which, except for the replacement of pinocembrin by cotoin (10) [S] and the absence of rubranine, shows a very similar composition, including the presence of anibine [Z]. Thus, by analogy with the reaction envisaged for the biosynthesis of deoxybruceol (11) [9], the formation of rubranine may also involve condensation of geranyl pyrophosphate, or even a linalool derivative, with a phloroglucinol system in this case that of pinocembrin.

. Ph = phenyl, Ge = geranyl Indeed, this must lead to la as the predominant citrylidene-chalcone [S], the precedence of Michael addition of the phenolate anion, formed from the hydroxyl of highest acidity, to the r$-unsaturated aldehyde over C-C bond formation having been established [IS]. Under conditions described for citral and phloroglucinol [ll]. a product resulted, which was fractionated by chromatography on silica gel into a 3:7 mixture of the flavanones 6 and 7 [IS]. a 10: 13 : 77 mixture of the novel chalcones 14% 14b and 15. and a product which was indistinguishable from natural (-)-rubranine by TLC, mp. UV. IR, PMR and MS comparison. The relative proportion of the flavanones 6 and 7 was determmed by measurement of the integrated intensities of the respective signals in the PMR spectrum of the mixture. The C-6 proton of 6 and the chromene protons of 7, subject to the paramagnetic effect of the electron current in the vicinal chelate system. give rise to signals at lower field than the C-8 proton of 7 and the chromene protons of 6. An analogous effect is responsible for the differences in chemical shifts of the signals due to the lone aromatic protons and the chromene protons in the chalcones.
