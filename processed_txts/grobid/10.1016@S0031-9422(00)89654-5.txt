AN OLEANANE ACID FROM ALZBERTIA EDULZS
A new oleanane, 3/?,19z,23,24-tetrahydroxy-12-oleanen-28-oic acid, was isolated together with nine known triterpene compounds from the leaves of Alibertia edulis, Rubiaceae.

INTRODUCTIONThe species of the Rubiaceae family contain many iridoids, alkaloids and triterpenes, notably ursane and oleanane derivatives, and their occurrence in species growing in the Brazilian 'Cerrado' has been reported [l-33. AIiberfia edulis A. Rich, commonly known as 'marmel5o' is a small tree widely spread in the Go&, Mato Gross0 and SBo Paula states, in which its ripe fruits are greatly appreciated by their delicious sweet taste. Recently, other Aliherria species have been investigated yielding iridoids [4] and triterpenes [3]. This paper describes the occurrence of a new oleanane derivative from A. edulis leaves in addition to nine known triterpenes.
RFSULTSANDDISCUSSIONThe crude ethanol extract from Alibertia edulis leaves was partitioned between hexane, chloroform and n-butanol. The hexane extract was fractionated by usual chromatographic procedures to afford r-amyrin (1) and fi-amyrin (2). The chloroform fraction chromatographed on a silica gel column afforded complex mixtures of alcoholic and acidic triterpenes. The acidic fractions were treated with diazomethane and a mixture of uvaol(3) [5] and erythrodiol (4) [6], and a mixture of ursolic ( 5) and oleanolic (6) acid methyl esters was isolated by preparative TLC. The remaining fractions were combined and submitted to preparative TLC furnishing a mixture of 23-hydroxyursolic acid methyl ester (7) and 23hydroxyoleanolic acid methyl ester (methyl-hederaginin, 8) and another mixture of 9 and 10. This mixture after acetylation and preparative reversed-phase HPLC gave 9a and lOa, a derivative of a new triterpene.*Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.
Compound9a was characterized by its physical and spectral data. This compound was first isolated from CIethra barbinerois, a Clethraceae species [7]. The 'HNMR spectrum of 1Oa (Table 1) when compared with the data of 9a showed very similar spectral features: two multiplet signals at S5.00 and 5.42 due to H-3 and H-12, respectively; the AB doublets attributed to CH,-23 and CH,-24 were observed at 64.06 (lH), 4.17     (2H) and 4.26 (1 H). The lowfield region of the spectrum of 10a showed, besides the above signals, two more at 63.34 and 3.15. These signals corresponded to two coupled protons as shown by a 'H-'H COSY spectrum. The lower field proton was further coupled with anotherR5
)
may be reversed 4 proton with a signal at 6 1.65. The H-18 of oleanolic acid occurs approximately at 63.0, so the signal at 63.15 was attributed to this proton and the one at 63.34 to H-19. The hydroxyl at C-19 can be assigned only IO an axial position to justify both the small coupling observed between H-18 and H-19, and the long range coupling of H-19 with H-21 (equatorial). The hindered C-19 hydroxyl is in agreement with the acctylation of only three hydroxyl groups in 10a.The '"CNMR spectrum of 1Oa also showed a close structural resemblance to 9a when the carbons of the A and B rings were analysed. The assignments of the remaining chemical shifts were achieved by comparison with the data of olcanolic acid methyl ester[8]. In fact, a /I-deshiclding effect was observed for C-18, C-20 and for C-I2 and C-16, due to C-I9 hydroxyl &effects. A strong yshielding effect was observed for C-29, C-21 and C-13 (Table1). The molecular formula, C,,H,,O, for 1Oa was supported by the mass spectral data.The presence of oleanolic and ursolic triterpenes in the extracts of leaves of A. edulis is in agreement with the placement of Aliherria in the Gardenieae tribe of the Rubiaceae family [9]. EXPERIMENTAL Plant material. AIihertia edulis A. Rich was collected in Campo Grande, Mato Gross0 do Sul, Brazil in August 1990. A voucher specimen (number 10) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Departamento de Quimica da Universidadc Federal do Mato Gross0 do Sul. Extraction and isolation of the constituents. Dried and powdered leaves (1.5 kg) of A. edulis were successively extracted with hexane. EtOH and EtOH Hz0 (6:4). The crude hcxanc extract (I 3.5 g) was fractionated by silica gel column chromatography yielding z-and P-amyrin (120 mg), cisand truns-phytol(80 mg) and fatty material. The crude ethanolic extract (I IO g) was solubilized in EtOH-H,O (9: 1) and partitioned into hexane (I2 g). CHCI, (17.0 g) and n-BuOH (36.5 g). The CHCI,-soluble part was submitted to CC on silica gel eluted with CH,CI, with increasing amounts of MeOH. After TLC, some frs were combined and mcthylated with CH,N,. Further CC on silica gel and prep. TLC eluted with CH,CI,-AcOEt (85: 15) and CHCI,-MeOH (98:2) gave 4 mixts of triterpencs: 3 and 4 (72 mg), 5 and 6 (100 mg), 7and 8 (32 mg), 9 and 10 (61 mg). The mixt. 9 and 10 was acetylated with pyridine--AC,0 at room temp. giving 9a and 1Oa. The mixt. was submitted to reversed-phase HPLC. using McOH H,O (X:2) as eluent. affording 9a (22 mg) and 10a (6 mg).
