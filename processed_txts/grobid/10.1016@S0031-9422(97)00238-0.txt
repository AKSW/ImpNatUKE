IRIDOIDS FROM TOCO YENA FORMOSA
The leaves of Tocoyena,/ormosa afforded two antifungal iridoids, ~-and fl-gardiol, and the new iridoids, mollugoside methyl ester and formosinoside. Formosinoside was characterized as its hexaacetyl derivative. 'L~ 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd   

I. INTRODUCTIONTocoyena.formosa (Chain. et Sch.) K. Shun, a small ornamental tree growing in dry regions of Central Brazil, is commonly known as 'genipapo do campo' and has very impressive yellow-green flowers [1]. In the course of our continuing search for bioactive constituents from rubiaceous species that grow in 'Cerrado Regions' of Brazil [2][3][4], we investigated the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the 60% aqueous ethanol extract of leaves of T. Jormosa. In our mechanismbased bioassay for potential anticancer agents utilizing genetically-engineered yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strains [5], this extract exhibited moderate and nonselective activity on all the mutant strains tested suggesting the presence of antifungal agents rather than potential anticancer agents. Subsequent confirmation of its antifungal activity using Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. esphaerospermum [6] followed by bioassay-guided fractionation afforded four iridoids 1-4. Of these, ~-gardiol (1) and fl-gardiol (2) which were obtained as an inseparable mixture [7] exhibited antifungal activity. The third iridoid, mollugoside methyl ester (3), is being described here for the first time from a natural source. The fourth iridoid found to be new and hence named formosinoside (4), was characterized as its hexaacetate derivative (5). This paper deals with the structure elucidation of 5 and the antifungal activities of 1 and 2.
RESULT AND DISCUSSIONThe 60% aqueous ethanol extract of the leaves of T. formosa was concentrated to half its original vol-* Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. ume and was extracted successively with hexane and ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate fraction on silica gel chromatography afforded three pure compounds identified as ~-gardiol (1), fl-gardiol (2) [5] (see Experimental) and mollugoside methyl ester (3) [8], and an inseparable mixture (3 : 1) of two compounds. These two compounds which were suspected to be isomers from NMR spectra of the mixture were separated via their peracetates to obtain the hexaacetate (5) c,f the major compound (4). Besides the iridoids, the ethyl esters of ferulic and caffeic acids were also isolated. The ~H N M R spectrum of 5 (Table 1) exhibited the presence of two olefinic protons at 8 5.55 and 8 5.80 (each 1H, dd, J = 6.0; 1.5 Hz, H-7 and dd, J = 6.0; 2.0 Hz, H-6). In addition, the 1H N M R spectrum showed signals at 8 5.00 (1H, d, J = 5.8 Hz), 8 5.92 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz), 3 4.22 and 4.90 (2H, dd, J = 11.0; 8.0 and 11.0; 3.0 Hz), which were attributed to protons at C-l, C-3 and C-10, respectively. The remaining doublet at 8 5.93 (1H, J = 8.0 Hz) could be assigned to the anomeric proton from sugar moiety present in the molecule of 5. The ~H N M R also supported the presence of six acetyl groups as broad signals at 8 [9] with a double bond between C-6, C-7 and hydroxyl function at C-10. By assuming a iridoidal skeleton, and by comparison with carbon assignments of known iridoids, it was possible to assign the carboxyl group (8 180.29 s) to C-11. The structure of the iridoidal aglycone and the position of glycosidic linkage of 5 were further elucidated, as follows, by an extensive use of 2D N M R methods (1HJH COSY, H E T C O R and COLOC). By COSY correlation it was possible to observe that a doublet at 6 5.00 (J = 5.8 Hz) was coupled to a double doublet at 3 3.00 (J = 9.0; 5.8 Hz) and a doublet at 6 5.92 coupled to a double doublet at 6 2.98 (J = 7.6; 2.0 Hz). In addition, the COSY-45 spectrum showed that the olefinic methine H-7 at 3 5.55 was correlated with methine H-8 at 3 3.08 (J = 9.0; 1.5 Hz); and an ABX system at 8 4.22 (J = 11.0; 8.0 Hz) and 4.90 (J = 11.0; 3.0 Hz) were due to the hydroxymethylene H-10. The H E T C O R spectrum of 5 revealed that the methine at 6 99.28 was correlated with H -I ' (8 5.93 d), wlhile the signal at 3 98.06 was correlated with H-1 (6:5.00 at). The correlations between methines 6 91.52 and H-3 ( x Y._X)Fig. 1 as in Fig. 1. Particularly, irradiation of the signal for 9fl-H at 6 3.00 produced significant enhancement of the H-10 (~20%) methylene and methine 5fl-H (~35%). Furthermore, irradiation of I~-H showed simultaneous enhancement of the signals at 8a-H (12%) and 3ct-H (15%). These findings suggest that the acetoxyl group at C-3 and the hydroxymethylene at C-8 are in fl disposition.From iridoids derivatives isolated from T. formosa only the epimeric mixture of a-and fl-gardiol showed antifungal activity (Table 2). The fungitoxic properties of some iridoidal aglycones have already been observed in the case of Alibertia macrophylla [4] and seem to be an interesting feature of Rubiaceae growing in 'Cerrado Regions'. Bioloyical screening procedures. The experimental methods utilized in the screening procedures with S.cerevisiae mutants [5] and C. cladosporioides [6] have 307 been described elsewhere. The procedure used for C.esphaerospermum was similar to that of C. cladosporioides. Extraction and isolation. Air-dried and powdered leaves (800 g) of 1".formosa were extracted with 60% aq. EtOH. The resulting extract was concd to half its original vol. and extracted with hexane followed by EtOAc. Evapn afforded hexane (3.00 g) and EtOAc (5.5 g) extracts. The EtOAc fr. was submitted to CC on silica gel and eluted with mixts of CHCI:~ and MeOH. A total of 28 frs were collected. Frs 9-11 were further purified by prep. TLC [silica gel, C6H6EtOAc (2:3) containing 3% HOAc] yielding an epimeric mixt. of 1 and 2 (42.5 mg) [5] and ethyl ferulate (19.4 mg). Frs 12-14 yielded, after prep. TLC (as described for 9-11) ethyl caffeoate (20 mg). Mollugoside methylester 3 (40 nag) [8] was isolated by prep. TLC [silica gel, C6H6-EtOAc (1:1)+1.5% HOAc], after purification of fr. 15.Fractions 17 18 were purified by prep. TLC isilica gel, EtOAc-MeOH H:O (77:15:8). TLC and ~H NMR investigations of this purification indicated that the resulting fr. was of interest and looked to be constituted of only one product. However, 13C NMR of this compound indicated an inseparable mixt. (3: 1) which was subjected to acetylation (Ac20/pyr. 25 째, 12 Hs). The acetyl derivatives obtained, were subjected to prep. TLC (silica gel, CH2CI~EtOAc (2:3)+1% HOAc), which afforded the major compound 5 (23 mg). MHz, CDC13 see Table 1.
