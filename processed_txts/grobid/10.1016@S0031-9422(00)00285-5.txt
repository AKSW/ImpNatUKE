Biosynthesis of friedelane and quinonemethide triterpenoids is compartmentalized in Maytenus aquifolium and Salacia campestris $
Maytenus aquifolium (Celastraceae) and Salacia campestris (Hippocrateaceae) species accumulate friedelane and quinonemethide triterpenoids in their leaves and root bark, respectively. Enzymatic extracts obtained from leaves displayed cyclase activity with conversion of the substrate oxidosqualene to the triterpenes, 3-friedelanol and friedelin. In addition, administration of (AE)5-3 H mevalonolactone in leaves of M. aquifolium seedlings produced radio labelled friedelin in the leaves, twigs and stems, while the root bark accumulated labelled maytenin and pristimerin. These experiments indicated that the triterpenes once biosynthesized in the leaves are translocated to the root bark and further transformed to the antitumoral quinonemethide triterpenoids.

IntroductionQuinonemethide triterpenoids are secondary metabolites restricted to the higher plant families, Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae (Bruning and Wagner, 1978). These compounds have shown a variety of biological activity such as antitumoral (Bhatnagar et al., 1951;GoncË alves de Lima et al., 1971), antimicrobial (Ferreira de Santana et al., 1971), antibiotic (Bhatagar et al., 1951;GoncË alves de Lima et al., 1969a;Gonzalez et al., 1977), antimalarial (Pavanand et al., 1989) and spermicidal activities.The co-occurrence of friedelanes and quinonemethides in several plants and in cell cultures has led to the postulation of a biogenetic relationship between these two classes of triterpenoids (Marini-Bettolo, 1979;Kutney et al., 1981;Gunaherath and Gunatilaka, 1983;Gunatilaka and Nanayakkara, 1984;Corsino et al., 1998) (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, no experimental work has been addressed to answer this question and thus the biosynthetic origin of the quinonemethide triterpenoids remains uncertain.The working model under evaluation in this study is based on the compartmentalized biosynthesis and accumulation of friedelane derivatives and quinonemethides, respectively, in leaves and in root bark of Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae species (GoncË alves de Lima et al., 1969bde Lima et al., , 1972;;Martin, 1973;Gonzalez et al., 1975;Martinod et al., 1976;Reddy et al., 1976;Dominguez et al., 1979;Furlan et al., 1990;Gamlath et al., 1990).The entry point for biosynthesis of quinonemethides requires oxidosqualene as a central intermediate, which by the action of a cyclase would give rise to the ®rst cyclic intermediate, 3-friedelanol (Fig. 1) and then, by the action of an oxidoreductase, the conversion to friedelin should occur between leaves and root bark. The transformation/translocation steps for the quinonemethide triterpenoids should take place in the root bark.In order to evaluate the enzyme activity for the biosynthetic step involving the cyclase and its localization in leaves and/or root bark of M. aquifolium (Celastraceae) and S. campestris (Hippocrateaceae), we developed a protocol to solubilize and to determine the activity of this cyclase using oxidosqualene as substrate. If the quinonemethide and friedelane triterpenoids present in root bark and leaves, respectively, are continuously synthesized, then the corresponding tissue should display this cyclase activity.Administration experiments with (AE)5-3 H-mevalonolactone carried out in leaves of M. aquifolium seedlings were crucial in the determination of the translocation hypothesis of the friedelin from leaves to root bark, and thus the biosynthetic relationship with the quinonemethide triterpenoids. The results obtained are described below.
Results and discussion
Friedelane and quinonemethide contentThe friedelane and quinonemethide contents in leaves and root bark of M. aquifolium and S. campestris are shown in Table 1. Leaves of M. aquifolium and S. campestris yielded the highest friedelane derivative amounts, with 3-friedelanol (1) and friedelin (2) accounting for more than one half of the triterpene content. As previously shown, the quinonemethides were not detected in leaves of either species. Nevertheless, in the root bark, the quinonemethides 3±8 were detected as the major components accounting for up to 0.2%. The extracts prepared from 3-year old M. aquifolium root bark yielded a high content of maytenin (3) (0.024%) and pristimerin (4) (0.097%) (Table 1). The root bark extracts of 7 year old plants of S. campestris, showed, in addition to 3 (0.32%) and 4 (0.033%), in increasing order of concentration 22hydroxymaytenin (5), 20-hydroxymaytenin (6), celastrol (7) and netzahualcoyone (8) (Fig. 2).The pattern of triterpene distribution in these two species is similar to that previously reported (GoncË alves de Lima et al., 1972;Reddy et al., 1975;Martinod et al., 1976;Dominguez et al., 1979;Furlan et al., 1990) i.e. with the exclusive accumulation of friedelane derivatives in the leaves, whereas the quinonemethides are the major constituents in the root bark and are absent in leaves of both species.  
Formation of triterpenoid productsSince the accumulation of friedelanes and quinonemethides is a clear indication of their compartmentalized biosynthesis in the leaves and roots of M. aquifolium and S. campestris, the presence or absence of cyclase activity in these tissues would provide direct evidence for this assumption. Thus a protocol for the determination of cyclase activity was developed, by examining the conversion of oxidosqualene as a substrate using a cell-free extract prepared from leaves and root bark of M. aquifolium and S. campestris. The in vitro conversion of oxidosqualene to the friedelane derivatives 3-friedelanol (1) was monitored by a GC method (see Section 3). The GC analysis also revealed that the enzymatic extracts catalyzed the formation of friedelin (2) (Fig. 4A andB) (see Section 3). The identi-®cation of these compounds was carried out by examination of their retention times with those of authentic samples (Fig. 3), and also by GC/MS in which both friedelanes could be identi®ed by the presence of molecular ions and other signi®cant peaks. Under the assay conditions studied, the formation of 1 and 2 appeared to be linear until ca. 50 min and up to 1.2 mg protein/ ml. The control experiments in the absence of the substrate, oxidosqualene, or protein extracts showed no triterpene formation. The cofactor requirement was next investigated using the following conversion assays: (i) 1 mM EDTA; (ii) dialysis (to remove divalent cations in the buer); (iii) dialysis and readdition of 30 mM Mg 2+ or 30 mM Mn 2+ ions. It was clear from these results that a divalent cation was required for cyclase activity as Mg 2+ stimulated the cyclase activity, whereas Mn 2+ inhibited the reaction. (Hohn and Vanmiddlesworth, 1986;Cane and Pargellis, 1987;Dehal and Croteau, 1988;Croteau and Purkett, 1989). This cyclase activity in crude extracts could not be concentrated by (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 precipitation (40±80% saturation), because a great loss of activity was observed, showing this methodology not to be ecient for future puri®cation of this cyclase.Having established the authenticity of the enzymatic transformation, a time-course analysis was next carried out, this being linear over a 50 min time-frame and reaching a maximum level within ca. 2 h. Assays were also conducted at various pH values, ranging from pH 6.5 to 9.0 (see Section 3). A broad peak of activity, centered at pH 7.0 was observed for friedelane derivative biosynthesis, typical of terpene cyclases (Croteau, 1987;Croteau and Purkett, 1989). The temperature dependence of the reaction was also investigated, and a maximum activity at 40 C was observed.The cell-free extracts prepared from root bark of both species were incubated with oxidosqualene similarly but did not yield friedelane derivatives, thus this cyclase is present only in the leaves of these two species.
Possible sites for the biosynthesis of triterpenoidsCell-free extracts prepared from leaves were capable of converting the oxidosqualene to 3-friedelanol (1) and friedelin (2) as determined by GC (Fig. 4A andB). The percentages of conversion into 3-friedelanol (1) and friedelin (2) were 0.020% (1) and 0.018% (2), respectively, in S. campestris whereas in M. aquifolium the conversion were 0.013% (1) and 0.012% (2). The control experiments indicated clearly that an enzyme was involved in this transformation as the boiled leaf extracts resulted in a major loss of activity. In conclusion, assays using protein extracts from leaves and root bark from Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae species indicated the leaves as the possible site of biosynthesis of friedelane derivatives which should be further translocated to the roots and transformed to the quinonemethide triterpenoids. In order to con®rm the possible translocation of friedelin derivatives from the leaves to root bark, a solution of (AE)5-3 H-mevalonolactone was administered to the leaves of M. aquifolium seedlings (3 years old). Friedelin (2) was isolated from the leaves, twigs and stems after 3 days of incorporation, diluted with unlabelled carrier products followed by recrystallization (®ve times) to constant speci®c radioactivity. The results of the radioactivity measurements for friedelin (2) and quinonemethide triterpenes maytenin (3) and pristimerin (4) are given in Table 2. A dilution of relative speci®c activity for friedelin (2) was observed between leaves and stems. No labelled friedelin was detected in the root bark of M. aquifolium but, importantly, labelled quinonemethides maytenin and pristimerin could be observed.These experiments including the determination of triterpenes and quinomemethides content, the feeding of (AE)5-3 H-mevalonolactone associated with the determination of cyclase activity in cell-free extracts from leaves, twigs, stems and root bark of Celastraceae represents the ®rst direct evidence to show compartmentalization of friedelane and quinonemethide triterpenoids.
Experimental
Plant materialThree year old seedlings of M. aquifolium were grown in the greenhouse of Departamento de Biotecnologia da UNAERP. The plants were harvested and immediately divided into root bark and leaves and frozen in liquid N 2 . Leaves and root bark of S. campestris were collected in Fazenda Canchin at Universidade Federal de SaÄ o Carlos (20 miles from Araraquara) frozen in liquid N 2 , and immediately transported to Araraquara, where cellfree extracts were prepared.
InstrumentationHPLC quanti®cation was carried out as described by Corsino et al. (1998). Response factors were calculated with freshly prepared reference solutions of quinonemethides 3±8. HPLC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10 AD Liquid Chromatograph using a reverse phase C 18 column (150Â4.6 mm i.d.) with a precolumn (20Â4.6 mm i.d.) in the isocratic mode with eluent EtOAc:MeOH (95:05) at a ¯ow of 1.0 ml/min. The column was purged with the mobile phase for 5 min, followed by equilibration for 4 h: the total analytical run time was 30 min. The spectral data were collected using a refraction index detector. The characteristic retention times for compounds 1 and 2 under these HPLC conditions were 23.26 and 24.03 min. GC analyses were performed on a Hewlett±Packard 5890 Series II Gas Chromatography with a split injector at 270 and a ¯ame ionization detector (FID) at 310 . The injection volume was 2 ml and the split ratio was 1:10. Nitrogen was employed as carrier gas. A 30 mÂ0.25 mm SPB-5 capillary column was employed with temperature  programming from 180 for 2.0 min, then increased by 5 /min to 280 , and maintained for 25 min. The data were collected with an HP 3396A integrator. GC/MS analyses were performed on a Hewlett±Packard 5970B. The injection volume was 2 ml and the split ratio was 1:10. Nitrogen was employed as carrier gas. A 30 mÂ0.25 mm HP-1 capillary column was employed with temperature programming from 50 for 2.0 min, then increased by 15 /min to 290 , and maintained for 25 min. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC 200 spectrometer at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, using CDCl 3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. (AE)5-3 Hmevalonolactone (33mCi/mmol) was purchased from Sigma.
Friedelane and quinonemethide triterpenoids analysisRoot bark and leaves of M. aquifolium and S. campestris were dried for 24 h at 40 in an oven with forced air circulation. The dried and powdered leaves of M. aquifolium (4500 g) and S. campestris (3200 g) obtained were exhaustively extracted with ethanol. The resulting ethanol extracts were ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord green gummy residues, 896.7 and 687.1 g, for M. aquifolium and S. campestris, respectively. The hexane soluble part of the ethanol extract M. aquifolium (96.5 g) and S. campestris (45.0 g) were applied to a Sigel column (70±230 Mesh), eluted with hexane and increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 70%) to give 55 and 35 fractions, respectively. Fraction 9 (0.175 g) of M. aquifolium and 7 (0.186 g) of S. campestris were subjected to Si gel column (230±400 mesh) chromatography, this being eluted with hexane and increasing amounts of EtOAc to give 3-friedelanol 1 (0.043 and 0.074 g, respectively) and friedelin 2 (0.052 and 0.089 g, respectively). The structures of the compounds 1 and 2 were elucidated by comparison of their 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and ES-MS data with literature values (Mahato and Kundu, 1994). The isolated and characterized compounds obtained were used as standards. The dried and powdered root bark of S. campestris (485 g) was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 . The resulting CH 2 Cl 2 extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a red gum (100.9 g). This extract was submitted to ®ltration chromatography on Si gel (300 g) eluted with hexane± EtOAc (1:1), EtOAc and EtOAc±MeOH (1:1) and MeOH. The hexane±EtOAc (1:1) (11.6 g) fraction was subjected to silica-gel column chromatography, eluted with hexane containing increasing amount of EtOAc to give 45 fractions. Fraction 6 (0.296 g) was applied to preparative TLC, eluted with hexane±EtOAc±HAc (98:02:1%) yielding the fraction 6±3 (0.093 g) which was further puri®ed by prep. TLC, eluted with hexane± EtOAc±HAc (90:10:1%) to give 3 (0.030 g), 7 (0.026 g) and 8 (0.046 g). Fraction 31 was subjected to preparative TLC, eluted with CHCl 3 ±MeOH±acetic acid (99:01:1%) to give 5 (0.007 g), 4 (0.012 g) and 6 (0.043 g).The dried and powdered root bark of 3 year old M. aquifolium seedlings (20.24 g) was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 . The resulting CH 2 Cl 2 extract was ®ltered and concentrated in vacuo to aord a red gum (0.52 g). This extract was submitted to silica gel column chromatography (100 g) eluted with hexane with increasing amount of EtOAc to give 48 fractions. Fraction 35 (0.183 g) was applied to preparative TLC, eluted with hexane±EtOAc (4:1) to yield 3 (0.021 g) and 4 (0.053 g). The structures of compounds 3±8 were elucidated by comparison of their 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and ES-MS data with literature values (Gunatilaka, 1996).
Protein extraction from leaves and root bark of M. aquifolium and S. campestrisAll steps were carried out at 4 . Frozen leaves and roots (100 g) were ground in liquid N 2 , using a mortar and pestle in the presence of XAD-4, and 30% (w/w) PVPP, 75 mM MES buer, pH 7.0, containing 30 mM MgCl 2 or MnCl 2 , 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM Na 2 S 2 O 4 , 5 mM Na 2 HPO 4 and 10 mM sodium ascorbate. The homogenate was stirred at 4 / 60 min, ®ltered through Miracloth (Calbiochem) with the ®ltrate centrifuged (30 000 g, 20 min) to provide a supernatant which was used as the enzyme source.
Incubation of oxidosqualene with M. aquifolium and S. campestris leaves and root bark enzymatic extractsThe protocol for cyclase activity required protein extracts (190 ml) of leaves and root bark of the M. aquifolium and S. campestris, 50 ml of oxidosqualene (30 mM), and MES buer (750 ml), pH 7.0 at 4 . Five assays were conducted in parallel. After 2 h incubation at 40 with shaking, the reaction mixture was extracted with EtOAc (300 ml). Thereafter, the EtOAc layer was evaporated to dryness and analysed by GC. For determining cofactor requirements, 10 ml of a 30 mM 
Protein assayProtein concentrations were determined according to Hartree (1972), using bovine serum albumin as the standard.
Chemical syntheses
Epoxidation of squaleneA solution of squalene (0.858 g, 2.09 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (6 ml), saturated aqueous sodium carbonate (6 ml) and mCPBA (0.719 g, 4.18 mmol) was stirred at 4 for 4 h. After the reaction was complete, as indicated by TLC, H 2 O (4 ml) was were added, followed by solid Na 2 SO 4 (0.100 g). To the reaction mixture was added Et 2 O (3Â20 ml), with the organic layer separated, washed successively with saturated aqueous NaHCO 3 , saturated aqueous NaCl and H 2 O (3Â10 ml, each). The organic layer was dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and evaporated to dryness to yield a residue (0.092 g), which was puri®ed by silica gel column (150 g) chromatography, eluted with hexane: EtOAc (95:05) to furnish the oxidosqualene (0.061 g, 68.5% of yield). The oxidosqualene obtained was submitted to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis and the molecular ion at m/z 476, corresponding to the molecular formula of the oxidosqualene was monitored and compared with authentic sample data.
pH and temperature optimumStandard assay conditions were used to determine the pH optimum of the cyclase, except that the buer was either MES±NaOH (0.1 M, pH 5.0±7.0), Tris±HCl (0.1 M, pH 7.0±9.0). Temperatures between 0 and 60 were evaluated for the capacity to promote 3-friedelanol 1 and friedelin 2 formation under the standard enzymatic assay.3.9. Feeding experiment (AE)5-3 H-mevalonolactone in an ethanol solution (100 Ci) was evaporated, dissolved in methyl cellosolve and the solution painted on intact leaves of M. aquifolium seedlings (3 years old). After 3 days, the leaves, twigs, stems and root bark were harvested and extracted with dichloromethane. The extracts on concentration deposited triterpenoid derivatives which were further processed for the isolation of the friedelin derivatives and/ or quinonemethide triterpenoids as described above. The radioactive compounds were diluted with unlabelled carrier (ca. 50 mg) and recrystallized (®ve times) to constant sp. act. (Table 2). The identities of the products were determined by both HPLC and analysis of the 1 H NMR spectra, these being compared to authentic standards.Fig. 1 .1Fig.1.
