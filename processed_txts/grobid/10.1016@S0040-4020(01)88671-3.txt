ISOLATION, STRUCTURE DETERMINATION, AND ABSOLUTE CONFIGURATION OF BARBATUSOL; A NEW BIOACTIVE DITERPENE WITH A REARRANGED ABIETANE SKELETON FROM THE LABIATE COLEUS BARBATUS
Barbatusol. isolated from the labiate Coleus barbatus Bentham, is shown to be a new phenolic diterpene with a rearranged abietane skeleton. Absolute configuration is established by hemisynthesis of barbatusol dimethyl-ether from the known carnosol. Barbatusol is endowed of biological activity. Known as "boldo" in Brazil, the Labiate Coleus barbatus Bentham

tical to the IR spectrum of barbatusol dimethyl-ether (XII), obtained by direct methylation of barbatusol (I). GLC analysis (3% OV-17) MS and UV data also supported the identity of XI with XII. However, 'H NMR showed XI to be a 6:4 mixture of double bond isomers identified as XI. and Xl,,. All our attempts to separate both isomers on silver nitrate impregnated silica gel TLC plates failed. The obtention of XI,, from carnosol (VII) proved the correctness of the structure of barbatusol (I). Optical rotation measurements of barbatusol dimethylether (XII) and of the synthetic material XI.,,, showed that both samples were laevorotatory.Since Xlb is optically inactive, this proved barbatusol dimethyl-ether (XII) to have the same 5S absolute configuration as XI,, i.e. the H at C-5 is a-oriented. This conclusion could have been anticipated since it is the same absolute configuration as that of (+)-ferruginol (II) isolated from Coleus barbatus together with barbatusol (I). Hence barbatusol is: (SS)-9(1@-+20)-abeo-abieta-l(l0).8.11,13tetraen-I 1,lZdiol. It seems reasonable to speculate that the driving force for the hydroxymethylene rearrangement of X into XI. promoting the B-ring expansion. may be seen in the presence of the bulky OMe group at C-l I, since TsCl rearrangement of pisiferol (V) led only to A-ring enlargement, affording pisiferin (XVII).'H Finally. treatment of the mixture XI,,, with BBr3 in dry CH2Cd" afforded. but in poor yield, the mixture of double bond isomers XIII, where barbatusol (I) is less than 10% abundant as deduced from the 'H NMR spectrum of XIII.
