Prenylated ¯avones from Neoraputia paraensis p
Three new prenylated ¯avones were isolated from the aerial parts of Neoraputia paraensis. On the basis of spectral data these ¯avones were identi®ed as 5,7,5 '-trimethoxy-6-(30-hydroxy,30-methyl-trans-but-10-enyl)-3 ',4 '-methylenedioxy-¯avone; 5,4 '-dihydroxy-3 ',5 '-dimethoxy-6,7-(20,20-dimethylpyran)¯avone and 5,4 '-dihydroxy-8,3',5'-trimethoxy-6,7-(20,20-dimethylpyran)-¯avone.

IntroductionThe genus Neoraputia (Rutaceae), containing six species, was described in 1978 by Emmerich during the study of the tribe Cusparieae (Emmerich, 1978). Some species previously described in Raputia, like R. paraensis and R. alba, were moved to the new created genus Neoraputia. The species Neoraputia alba was chemically investigated and ten ¯avones and one ¯avanone were reported (Arruda, Vieira, Fernandes & Silva, 1993;Arruda et al., 1991). The main structural features of these ¯avonoids were the highly methoxylated substitution pattern and the presence in some structures of a 2,2-dimethylpyran moiety attached to the Aring of the ¯avone skeleton. In a previous paper (Souza, Arruda & Arruda, 1995), we reported the isolation of seven ¯avones from Neoraputia paraensis, six highly methoxylated ¯avones and one pyrano¯avone. In a continuation of our chemical investigation on this species, we now report the isolation and structural determination of three new prenylated ¯avones (1±3).
Results and discussionStems and leaves of N. paraensis were percolated separately with hexane and dichloromethane, successively. The dichloromethane extract of leaves, when submitted to chromatography on silica gel columns, aorded compounds 1 and 2. The dichloromethane extract of stems, using similar techniques, furnished compound 3. These compounds (1±3) were identi®ed as ¯avones mainly via the characteristic 13 C NMR signals of C-2, C-3 and C-4 (Table 1) (Markham & Chari, 1982), together with their UV spectra (see Experimental) (Markham & Mabry, 1982). Unlike 1, compounds 2 and 3 have hydroxyl groups at C-5 positions (d H 13.05 and 12.75, respectively) supported by the lower ®eld signals of carbon C-4 (d C 182.4 and 183.8, respectively).Compound 1 was isolated as a colorless solid with a molecular ion peak at m/z 440 (EIMS) corresponding to the formula C 24 H 24 O 8 . The 1 H NMR spectrum showed two doublets at d H 6.74 and 6.84 (1H each, J = 16.4 Hz) and a singlet at d H 1.41 (6H, a pair of magnetically equivalent methyl groups) which is consistent with a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-trans-but-1-enyl moiety (Khalid & Waterman, 1981) 0123456789con®rmed this group. Further examination of the 1 H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of one methylenedioxy group [d H 6.07 (s, 2H)], three methoxyls [d H 3.83, 3.97 and 4.00 (s, 3H each)] and an AB coupling system [d H 7.07 and 7.11 (J=1.3 Hz)]. The AB coupling system and fragment ion at m/z 176 (4), produced by C-ring RDA ®ssion, indicated that the B-ring was substituted at 3 ', 4' and 5 ' positions with a methylenedioxy and methoxyl group. The absence of a [M-15] + peak in the mass spectrum suggested that there was no methoxyl group attached to C-6 or C-8 on the A-ring (Mabry & Markham, 1975). Moreover, the signals observed at d C 96.8 and d H 6.80 are typical of a nonsubstituted C-8 A-ring (Markham & Chari, 1982;Markham & Mabry, 1982), therefore the 3-hydroxy-3methyl-trans-but-1-enyl substituent was assigned to C-6 and the remaining methoxyls at C-5 and C-7. This was con®rmed by the presence of a methoxyl signal at d C 61.1 (OMe-5), which is characteristic of an orthodisubstituted methoxyl group (Panichpol & Waterman, 1978). Finally, the 13 C NMR spectral data supported the proposed structure by comparison with values for related compounds 6 and 7 (Khalid & Waterman, 1981;Arruda et al., 1993). From these spectral data, 1 was identi®ed as 5,7,5 '-trimethoxy-6-(30-hydroxy,30methyl-trans-but-10-enyl)-3 ',4 '-methylenedioxy-¯avone.NMR, UV and EIMS data of compounds 2 and 3, obtained as yellow prisms and yellow pellets respectively, suggested very similar structures, with compound 3 having an additional methoxyl group {[M] + m/z 396 (2) and 426 (3)}. UV showed bands at l max 359 nm (2) and 357 nm (3), typical of ¯avones, the bathochromic shifts (54 and 55 nm, respectively) induced by 2 M NaOH solution, indicating a 4'-OH (Mabry, Markham & Thomas, 1970). The symmetrical B-ring system for both compounds, with methoxyl groups at C-3' and C-5 ' [d H 4.00 (s, 6H) for 2 and 3.99 (s, 6H) for 3], was con®rmed by the 1 H NMR spectra showing a 2H singlet peak at d H 7.09 (2) and 7.19 (3) which corresponded to the H-2 '/6 '. This was supported by the Cring RDA fragment ion at m/z 178 (5) in its mass spectrum. The presence of a 2,2-dimethylpyran ring was deduced from the 6H singlet at d H 1.47 (2) and 1.60 (3) due to the gem-dimethyl group and two doublets (J = 10.0 Hz) at d H 5.62 and 6.71 for (2) and 5.64 and 6.74 for (3), corresponding to the two cis-coupled ole®nic protons. The 2,2-dimethylpyran ring at 6-and 7positions on A-ring was deduced on the basis of 1 H NMR spectra of the diacetylated derivatives 2a and 3a which exhibited up®eld shift for H-40 (0.21 and 0.23 ppm, respectively) and down®eld shift for H-30 (0.15 and 0.16 ppm, respectively). The acetylation of the 5-OH group is observed to cause a marked diamagnetic shift (Dd acetyl =+0.25 to +0.4) of the peri-H (H-40) and a small paramagnetic shift (Dd acetyl =À0.1 to À0.15) of H-30, attributed to steric eects, while the acetylation of an angular system (2,2-dimethylpyran ring at 7-and 8-positions) does not show any appreciable eect on H-40 (Arnone, Cardillo, Merlini & Mondelli, 1967). Therefore, the remaining signals in the 1 H NMR spectrum of 2 d H 6.54 and 6.44 (s, 1H each) were attributed to H-3 and H-8, respectively. The absence of a singlet around d H 6.4 in the 1 H NMR spectrum of 3 was indicative of the presence of a methoxyl group [d H 3.95 (s, 3H) and d C 62.1] at C-8. The 13 C NMR spectral data for 2 and 3 were assigned by comparison with data from literature (8±10) (Agrawal & Rastogi, 1981;Arruda et al., 1993). From the above data, the structures 2 and 3 were characterized as 5,4 '-dihydroxy-3 ',5 '-dimethoxy-6,7-(20,20dimethylpyran)¯avone and 5,4 '-dihydroxy-8,3 ',5 '-trimethoxy-6,7-(20,20-dimethylpyran)¯avone, respectively.
