Cyclopropane-and spirolimonoids and related compounds from Hortia oreadica
The dichloromethane extract from taproots of Hortia oreadica afforded six limonoids, these are 9,11-dehydro-12a-acetoxyhortiolide A, hortiolide C, 11a-acetoxy-15-deoxy-6-hydroxyhortiolide C, hortiolide D, hortiolide E, 12b-hydroxyhortiolide E, in addition to the known limonoid, guyanin. The dichloromethane extract from stems of H. oreadica also afforded two limonoids 9,11-dehydro-12a-hydroxyhortiolide A and 6-hydroxyhortiolide C. As a result of this study and literature data, Hortia has been shown to produce highly specialized limonoids that are similar to those from the Flindersia (Flindersioideae). The taxonomy of Hortia has been debatable, with most authors placing it in the Toddalioideae. Considering the complexity of the isolated limonoids, Hortia does not show any close affinity to the genera of Toddalioideae. That is, the limonoids appear to be of little value in resolving the taxonomic situation of Hortia.

IntroductionHortia is a Neotropical genus of the Rutaceae, traditionally included in the subfamily Toddalioideae, subtribe Toddaliinae (Engler, 1931). Hortia species are found from Panama to the state of São Paulo, Brazil, with most of the species occurring in the Amazonian region. Historically, De Candolle (De Candolle, 1824) described Hortia brasiliana Vand., which was collected in the southeastern part of the state of Minas Gerais and in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and Saint-Hilaire (Saint-Hilaire, 1824) described a shrub collected in Goiás and in western Minas Gerais, and also named it H. brasiliana. Engler (1874) also attributed the name H. brasiliana to the shrubby species of central Brazil. In the same study, he described a new arborescent species, Hortia arborea Engl. Recently, Groppo et al. (2005) showed that H. brasiliana and H. arborea represent the same arborescent species, and that H. brasiliana Vand. ex DC. is the correct name. Albeit well known, the shrubby species found in central Brazil remained unnamed, so Groppo et al. (2005) called it Hortia oreadica Groppo, Kallunki and Pirani. Our taxonomic interest in the Rutaceae motivated an investigation of the taproots and stems of H. oreadica, whose extracts afforded eight new limonoids (1-8, Fig. 1), in addition to the known guyanin (9). A search for previous phytochemical studies of Hortia species indicated that only three limonoids (Fig. 1) have been previously reported from the genus, namely guyanin (9) (Jacobs and Ramdayal, 1986), hortiolide A (10) and B (11) (Suárez et al., 1998(Suárez et al., , 2002)).
Results and discussionCompound 1 showed spectroscopic characteristics close to those of hortiolide A (10) (C 27 H 32 O 7 ). HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C 27 H 30 O 8 for compound 1, requiring the presence of additional oxygen in comparison with 10. The main changes observed in the 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 1 were the presence of additional signals of a hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom (d 4.25, d, J = 6.8 Hz) and of an olefinic hydrogen (d 6.20,d,J = 6.8 Hz). This oxymethine hydrogen (d 4.25) was coupled to the olefinic hydrogen at d 6.20, and showed a one-bond correlation with the 13 C NMR signal at d 66.0 (HSQC) and long-range correlation with the C-14 (d 167.3), C-17 (d 79.8) resonances and 13 C NMR signals at d 153.3 and 120.7 (HMBC), indicating the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-12 and a double bond between C-9 (d 153.3) and C-11 (d 120.7). In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for 10. In addition, the NOE of the H-12 (d 4.25) coming from H-17 (d 4.91) suggested a spatial proximity of H-17b to H-12, which requires the hydroxyl group at C-12 to be anti (a) to H-17 (b). The structure of the new natural product 1 was thus established as 9,11-dehydro-12a-hydroxyhortiolide A. Its structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13 C NMR spectrum (Table 2) with that of hortiolide A (10) (Suárez et al., 2002).Compound 2 exhibited similar NMR spectra to 1 (Tables 1 and2) except for the presence of a secondary acetoxyl group ( 13 C NMR signals d 169.4, 20.8, 1 H NMR signal OCOMe d 2.02). A significant downfield shift for H-12 (d 5.28), when compared with 1, determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-12. The 1 H NMR resonance at d 5.28 and a methyl 1 H NMR signal at d 2.02 showed long-range correlation with the 13 C NMR resonances at d 169.4 (HMBC), confirming an acetoxyl group at C-12. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for 1. Thus, the structure of the new limonoid was characterized as 9,11-dehydro-12a-acetoxyhortiolide A (2).The structure of compound 3 is more complex than those of 1 and 2. The NMR spectra (Tables 1 and2) and extensive analysis of 2D NMR spectra confirmed the hortiolide-type (10, 11) framework for 3. One of the changes observed in the 1 H and 13 C NMR  2) for 3 exhibited resonances in close agreement with those for the corresponding carbons in hortiolide A (10) (Suárez et al., 1998(Suárez et al., , 2002)). However, the quaternary carbons C-9 and C-14 could not be explained by the presence of a normal C-ring as in hortiolide A (10). The formation of a cyclopronane ring involving C-9, C-8 and C-14 in a 9,11-dehydrohortiolide A precursor may have occurred, resulting in a hortiolide-A-bicyclo-[5 11-14 .1 8 .0 9,14 ]-hexane system, whose spectroscopic properties were in accord with the above data. HREIMS showed the molecular formula C 27 H 32 O 8 and confirmed the structure 3 for this compound.The relative stereochemistry of compound 3 was determined from g-NOESY experiments. The NOEs of the H-5 (d 2.52) and H-17 (d 5.35) coming from H-15 (d 4.40) suggested a spatial proximity of H-5b and H-17b to H-15, which requires the hydroxyl group at C-15 to be anti (a) to H-5 and H-17. In the same way, the NOEs of the H 3 -19 (d 1.42) and H 3 -18 (d 1.18) coming from H 3 -30 (d 1.87), required the Me-30 to be syn (a) to Me-18 and Me-19. All these NOEs require rings A and D nearer to boat conformations and cyclopronane ring on the a-side of the molecule. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13 C NMR spectrum with that of hortiolide A (10) (Suárez et al., 2002).The final confirmation of the structure of 3, named hortiolide C, came from a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. 2). The low temperature crystal structure of hortiolide C (3) shows the presence of two hortiolide molecules, one CH 3 OH and one water molecule per asymmetric unit (Tables S1 andS2). Ortep 4 type view of both hortiolide C conformers showing selected atoms labeling and the 50% probability ellipsoids are presented in Fig. 2a andb, respectively.   The spectra of 1-10 were run in CDCl 3 at 100 MHz for 1-9, and at 75 MHz for 10; models 9 and 10: Jacobs and Ramdayal (1986) and Suárez et al. (2002)), respectively. Assignments are based on HSQC and HMBC experiments.Compound 4 showed spectroscopic characteristics close to those of 3 (C 27 H 32 O 8 ). HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C 27 H 32 O 9 for compound 4, requiring the presence of additional oxygen in comparison with 3. The main change observed in the 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 4 was the presence of an additional signal of hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom (d 4.89, brs). This oxymethine proton (d 4.89) showed one-bond correlation with the 13 C NMR resonance at d 71.4 (HSQC) and a long-range correlation (HMBC) with the signals d 51.8 (C-5) and 175.4 (C-7), indicating the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-6. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for 3. The structure of the new natural product 4 was thus established as 6-hydroxyhortiolide C.Compound 5 displayed spectroscopic characteristics close to those of 4. Analysis of the 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 5 established a pair of geminal doublets at d 2.23 and 2.02 (d, J = 10 Hz), which showed a long-range correlation (HMBC) with the 13 C NMR signal of C-16 (d 170.4), indicating that a methylene must be a to C-16, requiring the D-ring as a saturated d-lactone. In HMBC experiments, the assignment of the unsubstituted C-12 could be determined from the correlation between the 1 H NMR H 3 -18 signal at d 1.24 and the 13 C NMR resonance at d 29.8, which showed a one-bond correlation with the 1 H NMR signals at d 1.65 and 1.30, ascribed to H-12a and H-12b, respectively. The hydrogens H 2 -12a,b were coupled to the hydrogen with 1 H NMR resonance at d 4.39 (brs) assigned to H-11. The 1 H NMR signal at d 4.39 and a methyl 1 H NMR resonance at d 2.27 showed long-range correlation with the 13 C NMR signal at d 170.7, indicating an acetoxyl group at C-11. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for 3. However, the NOE of the H-5 (d 2.53) coming from H-11 (d 4.39), required the acetoxyl group at C-11 to be anti (a) to H-5. Thus, compound 5 was proposed as 11aacetoxy-15-deoxy-6-hydroxyhortiolide C.The NMR spectra of compound 6 clearly indicated A and D rings, and side-chain C-6-C7 similar to 3. HREIMS indicated the molecular formula C 27 H 32 O 9 , requiring the presence of an additional oxygenate moiety in comparison with 3. However, the main changes observed in the 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 6 was the presence of an additional signal of an olefinic hydrogen (d 5.79, dd, J = 2.5, 2.3 Hz). In the HMBC experiments, the unsubstituted C-12 could be determined from the correlation between the H 3 -18 1 H NMR resonance at d 1.42 and the 13 C NMR signal at d 42.0, which showed one-bond correlation (HSQC) with the 1 H NMR resonances at d 2.38 (dd, J = 18.4, 2.5 Hz) and 2.18 (dd, J = 18.4, 2.3 Hz), ascribed to H-12a and H-12b, respectively. The hydrogens H 2 -12 were coupled to the olefinic hydrogen at d 5.79, thus locating the double bond between C-9 and C-11, and requiring cyclopropane ring opening, when compared with 3. The olefinic hydrogen at d 5.79 showed a one-bond correlation with the 13 C NMR signal at d 131.5 and long-range correlation with the resonances d 42.0 (C-12), 48.6 (C-13) and 64.8 (C-14). The hydroxyl group must thus be connected to C-8 due to the observed 13 C NMR signal for a hemiketal carbon at d 116.8, which showed a cross-peak with the 1 H NMR signal of H 3 -30 (d 1.73). In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for 3. However, the NOE of the H 3 -18 (d 1.42) coming from H 3 -30 (d 1.73), required the Me-30 to be sin (a) to Me-18. These data were consistent with the structure 6 for this new limonoid, named hortiolide D.The NMR spectra of compound 7 clearly indicated C and D rings similar to guyanin (9, Jacobs and Ramdayal, 1986), and A ring with the side-chain C-6-C7 similar to 3 (Tables 1 and2). The main changes observed in the 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 7 were the presence of additional signals of a terminal methylene (d 4.92, 4.56, d, J = 3.9 Hz). From the HMBC experiments, the correlation found between the 1 H NMR resonances at d 4.92 and 4.56 and the 13 C NMR signals at d 162.5 and that for C-9 (d 62.2) led them to be assigned as H 2 -30 and C-8, respectively, hence indicating that the terminal methylene must be vicinal to C-8. These observations, the presence of only four tertiary methyl groups (d 1.04, 1.14, 1.21, 1.35) and not five as in 3, indicated cyclopropane ring opening, resulting in a spiro[4 10,1,O,8 .4 11-14 ]nonane with C-9 as spiro carbon. HREIMS indicated the molecular formula C 27 H 30 O 7 and confirmed the structure 7 for this compound. These data were consistent with the structure 7 for this new limonoid, named hortiolide E.Compounds 8 displayed spectroscopic characteristics close to those of 7 (C 27 H 30 O 7 ). HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C 27 H 30 O 8 for compound 8, requiring the presence of additional oxygen in comparison with 7. The principal difference observed in the 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 8 was the presence of an additional hydrogen signal attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom (d 4.12 t, J = 5.5 Hz). This oxymethine hydrogen (d 4.12) showed a one-bond correlation (HSQC) with the 13 C NMR signal at d 76.5 and long-range correlations (HMBC) with the resonances d 61.5 (C-9), 169.3 (C-14) and 19.4 (Me-18), indicating the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-12. The hydrogen H-12 was coupled to the methylene hydrogen at d 2.64 (dd, J = 16.6, 5.5), 2.39 (d, J = 16.6) and to the hydroxyl hydrogen at d 2.80 (d, J = 5.5), assigned to H-11a, H-11b and 12-OH (no correlation in the HSQC spectrum), respectively. The C-17 resonance was expected to be displaced upfield by the c-effect of the 12b-OH group (Asakawa et al., 1977). In comparison with the 13 C NMR spectrum of the parent compound 7 (C-17, d 80.0), the 12b-OH group exerted 3.6 ppm upfield shifts for the C-17 resonance position (d 76.4). In the g-NOESY experiments, the NOE of the H 3 -18 (d 1.11) coming from H-12 (d 4.12), required the hydroxyl group at C-12 to be anti (b) to H 3 -18. In addition, the NOE of the H 3 -18 (d 1.11) coming from H-30b (d 4.56), required the CH 2 -30 to be syn (a) to Me-18. The g-NOESY experiments facilitate the elucidation of the relative configuration of C-9, which has the same stereochemistry as in guyanin (9, McLean et al., 1988). Thus, the structure of compound 8 was proposed as 12b-hydroxyhortiolide E.
Concluding remarksAs a result of this study and analysis of literature data (Jacobs and Ramdayal, 1986;Suárez et al., 1998Suárez et al., , 2002)), Hortia produces highly specialized limonoids that are similar to those from the Flindersia (Flindersioideae, Rutaceae; Breen et al., 1984), Cedrelopsis (Ptaeroxylaceae, Mulholland et al., 1999Mulholland et al., , 2000Mulholland et al., , 2003Mulholland et al., , 2004)), Meliaceae and Cneoraceae families (A,B-seco-limonoids) (da Silva and Gottlieb, 1987). The taxonomy of Hortia has been debatable and is in doubt. Groppo et al. (2008) in an analysis of sequence data from two noncoding regions of the chloroplast genome -rps 16 intron and trnL-trnF from 65 species of 59 genera representing all the subfamilies and tribes of Rutaceae, suggested that Adiscanthus and Hortia formed a very strong clade in all their analyses. Because of its baccate fruit and syncarpous ovary, (Engler, 1931) included Hortia as the single Neotropical genus in the Toddalioideae subtribe Toddaliinae. On the basis of its follicular fruit and apocarpous ovary, he included Adiscanthus in the Rutoideae, subtribe Galipeinae, tribe Galipeae (names replacing the illegitimate Cuspariinae and Cusparieae, proposed by Kallunki and Pirani, 1998). Based on chemical characteristics, da Silva et al. (1988) placed Hortia within the Galipeae (Cusparia informal tribe, da Silva). Considering the complexity of the isolated limonoids, Hortia does not show any close affinity to the genera of the Rutoideae and Toddalioideae. The familial position of Cedrelopsis has also been controversial. This genus was originally classified in the family Meliaceae and later in the Rutaceae and Ptaeroxylaceae (Pennington and Styles, 1975). Recently, molecular phylogenetic study classified Ptaeroxylaceae (including Cedrelopsis) in the Spathelioideae (Rutaceae; Razafimandimbison et al., 2010;Appelhans et al., 2011). Limonoid types of Cedrelopsis suggest a strong affinity with the Hortia genus. However, Cedrelopsis contains chromones which do not seem to be common in all Rutaceae genera, and these have only been found in the Spathelioideae, Dictyolomatoideae and the Cneoraceae ( Sartor et al., 2003;Lima et al., 2005). Indeed many chemists were perhaps interested in alkaloids from the Rutaceaea, and will rarely identify all potentially systematic important classes of compounds present in the plant. The low concentration of limonoids is also likely to be responsible for the complex limonoids must have remained undiscovered for many years in genera of the Toddalioideae. Thus, complex limonoids appear to be of little value in resolving the taxonomic situation of Hortia.Little tracer work has been conducted to study biosynthesis of the limonoids, and ideas on their biogenesis are derived from hypothetical chemical relations between the compounds which have been isolated. Compound 3 appears to be formed via cyclization by electrophilic addition utilizing the unsaturated carboxyl at C-16, terminated by addition of hydride at C-11 in a 9,11-dehydrohortiolide A precursor, followed by a reaction of the enol with the molecular oxygen, hydroxylating C-15, as summarized in Scheme 1. The biogenesis of compound 5 appears to be similar to that proposed for 3, however, by addition of water at C-11 and the enol accepting the proton at C-15 to form the original carboxyl moiety (Scheme 1). Compound 6 appears to be produced from compound 3 by ring expansion of cyclopropane by a monooxygenase with hydroxylation at C-8, as summarized in Scheme 1. In guyanin ( 9), the biogenetic process is believed to be based on oxidation, followed by rearrangement and recyclization of reactive intermediates (McLean et al., 1988). Guyanin (9) was the only example of C-9 spirolimonoid, but now hortiolide E ( 7) and 12b-hydroxyhortiolide E ( 8) have the same spiro-ring arrangement. Thus, in principle, hortiolide E (7) can represent an intermediate stage in the formation of guyanin (9) from a 9,11-dehydrohortiolide A precursor (Scheme 1).

IR: Bomen-Ft/IR.
Plant materialH. oreadica was collected in the Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke, Amazonas, Brazil, and identified by J.R. Pirani (Department of Botany, University of São Paulo). A voucher specimen (Groppo Jr. 458) was deposited in the herbarium of the cited department.
Extraction and isolationGround taproots (3.3 kg), and stems (2.4 kg) of H. oreadica were successively extracted using hexane (3Â, 5 L), CH 2 Cl 2 (3Â, 5 L) and MeOH (3Â, 5 L), at room temperature. The concentrated CH 2 Cl 2 extract (67.6 g) from the taproots was subjected to column chromatography (CC), over silica gel (70-230 mesh; 20 cmÂ 8.0 cm) in vacuo. Elution with hexane, CH 2 Cl 2 (1.0 L), EtOAc (1.0 L) and MeOH (1.0 L) yielded five fractions. The CH 2 Cl 2 fraction was subjected to silica gel CC (230-400 mesh; 5.2 cm Â 28.0 cm). Elution with a hexane-acetone gradient yielded 11 new fractions, of which fraction 10 was purified further on silica (230-400 mesh; 3.0 cm Â 29.0 cm) two times with hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 -acetone (17:2:1), and then hexane-acetone (4:1), to afford compound 6 (127.6 mg). Fraction 11 was purified further on silica gel CC two times as described above using hexane-acetone (6:1), and hexane-acetone (4:1), respectively, to afford three new fractions (11a-c) containing limonoids. Fraction 11a was subjected to additional silica gel CC as described above using hexane-acetone (2:0.4) and then to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification (MeOH; detection UV k 364 nm, flow rate: 3.0 mL min À1 , polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G), and yielded compound 7 (9.6 mg). Fraction 11b was also further purified by silica gel CC as described above using hexane-acetone (3:1) as eluant and then by HPLC (MeOH:CH 2 Cl 2 , 80:20; detection UV k 364 nm, flow rate: 3.0 mL min À1 , polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G) purification, yielding compound 9 (4.4 mg). Fraction 11c was subjected twice to HPLC eluted with MeOH:CH 2 Cl 2 (80:20), and then MeOH, with detection at UV k 364 nm, and flow rate of 3.0 mL min À1 , using a polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G, to yield compound 2 (6.7 mg). The EtOAc fraction from the concentrated CH 2 Cl 2 extract was subjected to silica gel CC (70-230 mesh, 5.3 cm Â 41.0 cm) in vacuo. Elution with hexane (500 mL), CH 2 Cl 2 (500 mL), EtOAc (500 mL) and MeOH (500 mL) yielded several fractions. All fractions were monitored by 1 H NMR (200 MHz) and the fraction eluted with MeOH was examined, which showed features of limonoids. This fraction was subjected to silica gel CC (230-400 mesh, 10.0 cm Â 41.0 cm). Elution with a hexane-MeOH gradient yielded compound 8 (7.3 mg) and other fractions. Two of these fractions were subjected to HPLC (MeOH:CH 2 Cl 2 , 80:20, detection UV k 364 nm, flow rate: 3.0 mL min À1 , polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G), yielding compounds 3 (20 mg) and 5 (8.7 mg), respectively.The concentrated MeOH extract (3.0 g) from stems was partitioned into hexane (concentrated 0.28 g), CH 2 Cl 2 (concentrated 0.754 g) and MeOH (concentrated 1.069 g) soluble fractions. The 1 H NMR (200 MHz) spectra of these fractions showed that the major limonoids were in the CH 2 Cl 2 soluble fraction, this being subjected to CC over silica gel (70-230 mesh, 10.0 cm Â 41.0 cm). Elution with a hexane-MeOH gradient yielded new fractions, with two of these subjected to recycling high-performance liquid chromatography (R-HPLC) (MeOH:CH 2 Cl 2 1:1; detection UV k 217 and 254 nm, flow rate: 3.0 mL min À1 , polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G), to afford compounds 1 (8.0 mg) and 4 (6.0 mg) after recycling 2 times. 4.3.1. 9,11-Dehydro-12a-hydroxyhortiolide A (1) Amorphous white solid; ½a 25 D + 32.73 (c 0.010, CHCl 3 ); IR (film) v max 3436 (OH), 1732 (carboxyl group), 1638 (a,b-unsaturated ketone) cm À1 ; 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ), see Table 1; 13 C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl 3 ), see Table 2; HSQC (400/100 MHz, CDCl 3 ); COSY (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ), HMBC (400/100 MHz, CDCl 3 ): H-2 ?

The data were collected up to 51.36°in 2h. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program (Enraf-Nonius, 1997-2000); integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack software system (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). No absorption correction was applied.spectra was the replacement of the resonances for an a,b-unsaturated d-lactone D-ring by signals for a 15-hydroxy-d-lactone. The 1 H NMR signal for H-15 at d 4.40 (d, J = 1.8 Hz) showed one-bond correlation with the 13 C NMR resonance at d 64.1 (HSCQ) and H-15 was coupled only to the hydrogen of a hydroxyl group (d 3.03, d, J = 1.8 Hz). Moreover, the existence of correlations between the 1 H NMR signal for H-15 and the 13 C NMR resonances at d 45.5 (quaternary), 48.2 (quaternary), and 171.5 led to their assignments as C-13, C-14 and C-16, respectively. The COSY experiments showed correlation of the signals for H-11a and H-11b only with the resonances for H-12a and H-12b. The 1 H NMR signals for H-11a and H-11b showed a long-range correlations with the 13 C NMR resonances of C-10 (d 47.6, quaternary) and C-14 (d 48.2, quaternary). The methyl 1 H NMR signal at d 1.42, assigned to Me-19, showed cross-peaks with the 13 C NMR signals for C-1, C-5, C-10 and at d 46.8 (quaternary), allowing the assignment of the resonance at d 46.8 to C-9, since it was the only carbon left in the skeleton for a 3 J correlation.
