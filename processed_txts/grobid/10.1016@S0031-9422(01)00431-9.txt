Antifungal amides from Piper arboreum and Piper tuberculatum
In continuation of our study of the Piperaceae we have isolated several amides, mainly those bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from leaves of Piper arboreum yielded two new amides, N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) together with the known compounds N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E), 9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4). Catalytic hydrogenation of 3 yielded the amide N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]pyrrolidine (5). We also have isolated six amides (6-11) and two antifungal cinnamoyl derivatives (12, 13) from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum. Compounds 1-11 showed antifungal activity as determined by direct bioautography against Cladosporium sphaerospermum while compounds 3-4 and 6-13 also showed antifungal activity against C. cladosporioides.

IntroductionChemical studies carried out on Brazilian Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of pyrones, lignoids and chromenes besides various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties (Das et al., 1996;Parmar et al, 1997;Ale´cio et al., 1998;Baldoqui et al., 1999;Navickiene et al., 2000). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal and antifungal properties (Miyako et al., 1989;Bernard et al., 1995;Ale´cio et al., 1998;Navickiene et al., 2000). In our previous papers, we have described the structures of the antifungal amides N-[7-(3 0 ,4 0 -methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-heptadienoyl]pyrrolidine, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl-8-(3 0 ,4 0 -methylenedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide isolated from leaves of Piper hispidum H. B. K. (Ale´cio et al., 1998) and 8(Z)-N-(12,13,14-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-Á 3 -pyridin-2-one from Piper tuberculatum Jacq. (Navickiene et al., 2000), besides eight known antifungal amides. In this paper, we describe the isolation, the structure elucidation and the evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) and nine (3-11) known antifungal amides N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3), its derivative N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]pyrrolidine (5) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4); besides pellitorine (6), Á ab dihydropiperine (7), piplartine (8), dihydropiplartine (9), cis-piplartine (or 8(Z)-N-(12,13, 14trimethoxycinnamoyl)-Á 3 -pyridin-2-one) (10) and fagaramide (11). In addition to these amides we isolated two cinnamoyl derivatives, methyl 6,7,8-trimethoxydihydrocinnamate (12) and methyl trans-6,7,8-trimethoxycinnamate (13). The amides isolated from leaves of Piper arboreum (1-4) and the hydrogenated derivative of 3 (5) were active against the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum, and the compounds isolated from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum 3, 4 and 6-13 (Navickiene et al., 2000) were also active against the fungi Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides, as evaluated by direct bioautography (Homans and Fuchs, 1970).
Results and discussionN-[10-(13,14-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pentadienoil]-pyrrolidine (1) has a molecular formula of C 16 H 17 NO 3 as determined by analysis of the electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS), elemental analyses and of the 13 C NMR spectroscopic data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1637 (conjugated carbonyl group); 1600, 1492 and 1442 (aromatic); 1246, 1192 and 1036 cm À1 . Its 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at 5.93 (2H, s), and four olefinic protons which showed signals at 6.29 (1H, d, J 7,8 =14.3 Hz), 7.77 (1H, dd, J 8,7 =14.3 and J 8,9 =10.9 Hz), 6.20 (1H, dd, J 9,8 =10.9 and J 9,10 =11.4 Hz) and 6.59 (1H, d, J 10,9 = 11.4 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that the double bonds possess the E and Z geometry (Shah et al., 1986;Ale´cio et al., 1998;Navickiene et al., 2000). The assignments of the E and Z configurations to hydrogens at C-7, C-8 and C-9, C-10, respectively were determined as follows; the doublet of doublets at 7.77 (H-8) showed coupling constants of 14.3 and 10.9 Hz typical of trans-trans configuration, which could be associated with an a,b unsaturated carbonyl system. The assignment of the cis configuration for the g, double bond was based on the coupling constant value 11.4 Hz between the H-9 and H-10 ( Cleyn and Verzele, 1975). The presence of a pyrrolidine moiety was determined by the signals at 3.52 (2H, m) and 1.90 (2H, m) attrib-uted to H-2/H-5 and H-3/H-4, respectively. The 13 C NMR spectral data (Table 1) of 1 were in full agreement supporting the presence of this moiety. The low-field region of the 13 C NMR spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at 164.8, 10 sp 2 carbons, four sp 3 carbons [ C 46.5, 45.8, 26.0, and 24.2], and a typical methylenedioxy carbon at 100.7. The assignment of the remaining signals for the aromatic carbons were based on comparison with data described in the literature (Arau´jo-Junior et al., 1997;Ale´cio et al., 1998;Navickiene et al., 2000).Arboreumine (2) was shown to have the molecular formula C 25 H 40 N 2 O 5 by analysis of both its ES-MS spectrum and its elemental analyses. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3400, 1700, 1659 and 1630 cm À1 characteristic of hydroxyl, carbonyl, conjugated amide carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, respectively. Its 1 H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two doublets at 2.15 (2H, J 2a,2b $ 2 0 a,2 0 b =17.0 Hz) and 2.37 (2H, J 2b,2a $2 0 b,2 0 a =17.0 Hz), attributed to H-2a, H-2 0 a and H-2b, H-2 0 b which are characteristic of methylene groups displaying geminal coupling. The presence of a hydroxyl group was further indicated by a signal assigned to a hydroxymethine hydrogen H-10, H-9 0 , at 4.29 (1H, dq, J 10,9 $9 0 ,8 0 =5.0 Hz and J 10,11 $9 0 ,10 0 =6.5 Hz). Three singlets of methyl protons at 1.83, 1.00, 0.95 and one doublet at 1.20 (J 11,10 $10 0 ,9 0 =6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-12, H-11 0 ; H-13, H-12 0 ; H-14, H-13 0 and H-11, H-10 0 , respectively. The signal at 2.80 was attributed to the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen, as confirmed by exchange with D 2 O in the 1H NMR experiment. The methine protons H-6, H-5 0 ; H-8, H-7 0 and H-9, H-8 0 showed signals at 5.81 (q, J 6,12 $5 0 ,11 0= 1.0 Hz), 5.70 (dd, J 8,9$7 0 ,8 0 =15.5 Hz and J 8,12 $7 0 ,11 0 =1,0 Hz) and 5.76 (dd, J 9,8$ 8 0 ,7 0 =15.5 Hz and J 9,10 $8 0 ,9 0 =5.0 Hz), respectively (Table 2). Proton assignments were further confirmed by analysis of the DQCOSY spectrum. The spin system derived from H-8, H-7 0 ; H-9, H-8 0 and H-10, H-9 0 was readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet of doublets at 5.76 assigned to H-9, H-8 0 (J 9,8 $8 0 ,7 0 =15.5 Hz and J 9,10 $8 0 ,9 0 =5.0 Hz) which showed cross-peaks with 1H doublet of doublets at 5.70 assigned to H-8, H-7 0 (J 8,9$ 7 0 ,8 0 =15.5 Hz and J 8,12 $ 7 0 ,11 0 =1.0 Hz) and with a 1 H doublet of quadruplet at 4.29 assigned to H-10, H-9 0 (J 10,9 $9 0 ,8 0 =5.0 Hz and J 10,11 $ 9 0 ,10 0 =6.5 Hz). This last signal also showed a cross peak with the 3H doublet at 1.20 assigned to H-11, H-10 0 (J 11,10 $ 10 0 ,9 0 =6.5 Hz). The 2H doublet at 2.15 assigned to H-2a, H-2 0 a (J 2a,2b $ 2 0 a,2 0 b =17.0 Hz) showed cross-peak with the 2H doublet at 2.37 assigned to H-2b, H-2 0 b (J 2b,2a $ 2 0 b,2 0 a =17.0 Hz). The 13 C NMR spectral data were in agreement with this unusual structure (Table 2). Besides, the signals of some carbons and the positions of attachment of various functionalities were unambiguously assigned following interpretation of the HMBC spectrum. The carbon signals at 49.5 and 40.9 assigned to C-2, C-2 0 and C-3, C-3 0 , respectively showed a correlation with the 3H singlets at 1.00, 0.95 (assigned to the two methyl groups attached to the carbon (C-3 and C-3 0 ), whereas the cross-peak between the carbon signal at 198.3 and the 3H singlet at 0.95 (C-14 and C-13 0 ) indicated the quaternary carbon C-3, C-3 0 was adjacent to the carbonyl group C-4. At the same time, the carbonyl carbon at 198.3 (C-4) displayed a correlation with H-2a, H-2 0 a and H-2b, H-2 0 b ( 2.15 and 2.37, respectively). These last protons also showed a cross-peak with the quaternary carbon C-3, C-3 0 ( 40.9). The cross-peaks between H-13, H-12 0 and C-14, C-13 0 and H-14, H-13 0 and C-13, C-12 0 were also observed. The carbon signals at 163.9 (C-5, C-4 0 ), 126.1 (C-6, C-5 0 ) and 40.9 (C-3, C-3 0 ) showed a correlation with the 1H singlet at 2.80 (assigned to the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom). Irradiation of the proton resonance at 2.80 (N-H) in the 2D NOESY experiment caused an enhancement (9%) of the signal at 2.15 (H-2a, H-2 0 a), corroborating the adjacent relationship between the amide group and C-2, C-2 0 . The carbon signals at 67.3 (C-10, C-9 0 ) and 135.6 (C-9, C-8 0 ) showed cross-peak with the 3H doublet at 1.20 indicating the presence of the methyl group C-11, C-10 0 adjacent to the hydroxymethine carbon. The a,b,g,unsaturated carbonyl carbon system was unambiguously assigned by the correlation between the proton signal at 1.83 assigned to the methyl group at the position 12, 11 0 with the carbon signals 126.1 (C-6, C-5 0 ) and 128.6 (C-8, C-7 0 ), whereas the quadruplet at 5.81 assigned to H-6, H-5 0 (J 6,12 $ 5 0 ,11 0 =1,0 Hz) showed a cross peak with the carbon signals at 163.9 (amide carbonyl carbon) and 128.6 (C-8, C-7 0 ). Finally, HET-COR analyses were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons and the structure of amide 2 was determined as depicted.The CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH (2:1) extracts from the seeds and leaves of P. tuberculatum were fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with C 6 H 14 containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%), followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to afford compounds 6-13. Pellitorine (6) was obtained from fraction 13 from extract seeds, without any further purification, and it was identified by direct comparison of its spectroscopic data with the data previously described by Rosario et al., 1996. Á a,b dihydro piperine (7) and dihydropiplartine (9) had their 1 H NMR spectra published for the same compounds previously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991) and Piper guineense (Parmar et al., 1997) and their 13 C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Piplartine (8) was isolated from seeds and leaves, and the 1 H and 13 C NMR data were similar those published (Duh et al., 1990;Filho et al., 1981). Cis-piplartine (10) had its 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Fagaramide (11) was isolated from leaf extract and its spectroscopic data were compared with those published (Isao, 1984). Methyl trans-6,7,8-trimethoxycinnamate (13) was previously described as a synthetic product (Settimj et al., 1976) and its spectroscopic data were similar to that obtained in this work.The antifungal activity of compounds 1-13 was determined by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of compounds 1-13 (Tables 3 and4) were obtained according to methodology described (Rahalison et al., 1994). The compounds having no inhibition for C. sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides growth at amounts higher than 10.0 mg were too weak to be considered.The minimum amount of compounds 3-4; 2 and 5; and 1 required to inhibit growth of the fungus C. sphaerospermum on the TLC plates was determined as 0.1 mg, 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 showed strong antifungal activity, higher than the standards miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). These two compounds also showed high activity against C. cladosporioides, the amide 4 being 50 times more active when compared with the reference compounds. In the case of compounds 6-10, 13 and 11, 12 the minimum amount to inhibit the growth of the fungus C. cladosporioides on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 and 10.0 mg, respectively. The higher limit detection of 5 mg values found for 6-10 and 13 indicated a moderate activity of these amides when compared to that observed with the standards miconazole and nystatin. The inhibition of fungal growth displayed for these compounds suggests that the pyrrolidine amides isolated from P. arboreum are substantially stronger antifungal agents than the 2.80 (1H, s) -2a, 2 0 a 2.15 (1H, d, J 2a,2b$ 2 0 a,2 0 b =17.0) 49.5 (t) 2b, 2 0 b 2.37 (1H, d, J 2b,2a$2 0 b,2 0 a =17.0) 3, 3 0 -40.9 (s) 4 -198.3 (s) 5, 4 0 -163.9 (s) 6, 5 0 5.81 (1H, q, J 6,12 $5 0 ,11 0 =1.0) 126.1 (d) 7, 6 0 -b 8, 7 0 5.70 (1H, dd, J 8,9 $ 7 0 ,8 0 and 8,12$ 7 0 ,11 0 =15.5, 1.0) 128.6 (d) 9, 8 0 5.76 (1H, dd, J 9,8 $ 8 0 ,7 0 and 9,10$ 8 0 ,9 0 =15.5, 5.0) 135.6 (d) 10, 9 0 4.29 (1H, dq, J 10,9 $9 0 ,8 0 and 10,11$ 9 0 ,10 0 =5.0, 6.5) 67.3 (d) 11, 10 0 1.20 (3H, d, J 11,10$ 10 0 ,9 0 =6.5) 23.4 (q) 12, 11 0 1.83 (3H, s) 19.0 (q) 13, 12 0 1.00 (3H, s) 22.7 (q) 14, 13 0 0.95 (3H, s) 23.8 (q)a Multiplicities of carbons (in parentheses) determined by a DEPT experiment.b This signal was not observed in the 13 C NMR spectrum.piperidine, dihydropyridone and isobutyl amides from P. tuberculatum. It is important to note that the inhibition of C. sphaerospermum by dihydropyridone amide 9 appears to be higher than the standard nystatin [(0.1 mg) compared with nystatin (0.5 mg)] (Navickiene et al., 2000) while the inhibition of C. cladosporioides was lower than the standards (Table 4).
Experimental
Instrumentation and chromatography materialsSilica gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 500 MHz and 13 C NMR at 50 and 125 MHz, using CDCl 3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar LC/UV/VIS model SD-1, using a reversed phase column (Supelcosil C 18 ; 21.2Â250 mm) eluted with MeOH:H 2 O (4:1), flow rate of 10.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. Elemental analyses were performed on a 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer Analyser.
Plant materialPiper arboreum H. B. K. leaves were collected in Araraquara-SP, Brazil and identified by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Cordeiro-1936) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biocie . ncias-USP, Sa˜o Paulo-SP, Brazil.Piper tuberculatum Jacq. seeds, leaves and stems were collected in the Campus do INPA-Manaus, Brazil, and identified by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Kato-163) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biocie. ncias-USP, Sa˜o Paulo-SP, Brazil.
Antifungal assaysThe microorganisms used in the antifungal assays C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 have been maintained at the Instituto de Bota . nica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay-10.0 ml of solutions corresponding to 100.0 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with C 6 H 14 :EtOAc (7:3) for compounds 1-5 and with CH 2 Cl 2 :MeOH (97:3) for compounds 6-13, after that the plates were dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum or C. cladosporioides in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 C. Clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of 1-5 and 6-13 required for it (Tables 3 and4). Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls whereas ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used as negative controls.
Extraction and isolation of constituentsA CH 2 Cl 2 soluble part of the MeOH:H 2 O (4:1) extract of leaves of P. arboreum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the amides 1-4.The dried and powdered leaves of P. arboreum (2000.0 g) were extracted three times with 2000 ml of EtOH, during 2 days, at room temperature. The resulting EtOH extract was filtered and conc. in vacuo to afford 245.8 g of a green gum, which was solubilized in MeOH:H 2 O (4:1), and extracted with C 6 H 14 , CH 2 Cl 2 and EtOAc respectively.

The resulting extract of seeds was filtered and conc. in vacuo to afford 2.9 g of a green gummy residue. Part of this extract (2.0 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography, eluted with C 6 H 14 :EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (77.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC [C 6 H 14 :EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 8 (33.0 mg) and 10 (25.0 mg). Fraction 19 (83.0 mg), submitted to prep. TLC [C 6 H 14 :EtOAc (75:25), three elutions], yielded 9 (7.0 mg). Fractions 8 (0.2 g) and 13 (39.0 mg) yielded compounds 6 (0.2 g) and 7 (18.0 mg), respectively, without any further purification. The leaf extract (56.9 g), submitted to CC (2000.0 g) [C 6 H 14 :EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity] yielded 70 fractions. Fractions 26-62 (32.0 g) were pooled and submitted to CC (1000.0 g), with the same solvent system as described earlier.Fraction 66 (0.9 g) yielded the amide 8 (0.9 g), without further purification.
