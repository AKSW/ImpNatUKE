Diketopiperazines produced by endophytic fungi found in association with two Asteraceae species
Diketopiperazine (DKP) derivatives, named colletopiperazine, fusaperazine C and E as well as four known DKPs were isolated from cultures of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Penicillium crustosum, both endophytic fungi isolated from Viguiera robusta, and a Fusarium spp., an endophyte of Viguiera arenaria, respectively. Their structures were established on the basis of their spectroscopic data. Conformational analysis of two known DKPs showed that folded conformations were as energetically stable as the extended one.

IntroductionDiketopiperazines (DKPs) are well known secondary metabolites produced by fungi (Laws and Mantle, 1985) that display several biological activities, such as antibiotic, antitumoral and immunosuppressant properties (Ameur et al., 2004), as well a wide range of biological effects in cell cycle progression (Cui et al., 1996).Condensation of two or three amino acid precursors is involved in the DKP biosynthetic pathway (Kozlovsky et al., 2000;Laws and Mantle, 1985), with the later also being known as cyclic dipeptides when derived from condensation of two amino acids. Secondary metabolites from fungi that incorporate more than one amino acid are typically synthesized via non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) (Mootz and Marahiel, 1997). A number of DKP derivatives feature either thiomethyl groups or disulphide bridges (Müllbacher et al., 1986), and those with an internal disulphide bridge are known as epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) which are typically toxic metabolites from fungi (Gardiner et al., 2005). The first and best-known ETP is gliotoxin, isolated from Gliocladium fimbriatum (Weindling, 1941;Weindling and Emerson, 1936), which is in-volved in animal mycoses and appears to be a factor contributing to virulence associated with invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients (Gardiner et al., 2005). Labelling experiments demonstrated that amino acids are precursors of ETPs (Gardiner et al., 2005), although how sulphur atoms are introduced into ETPs is poorly understood. While it has been demonstrated that methionine, cysteine and sodium sulphate can act as sources of sulphur (Kirby et al., 1980), the mechanisms by which sulphur atoms are introduced are still unknown (Gardiner et al., 2005).Endophytes have been identified as rich and relatively untapped sources of novel bioactive secondary metabolites (Bashyal et al., 2005;Clardy and Walsh, 2004;Gunatilaka, 2006;Strobel et al., 2004). Endophytic fungi can be detected within the tissues of apparently healthy plant hosts (Schulz and Boyle, 2005) and they have been found in almost all plants investigated to date (Arnold et al., 2000). Several novel bioactive metabolites have recently been isolated from these microorganisms (Gallo et al., 2007;Guo et al., 2008;Pupo et al., 2006;Borges et al., 2009). Interestingly, some endophytic fungi have been reported to produce bioactive compounds previously isolated from their host plants, including the therapeutic anticancer drugs taxol (Stierle et al., 1993(Stierle et al., , 1995;;Strobel et al., 1996), vincristine (Yang et al., 2004), podophyllotoxin (Eyberger et al., 2006;Puri et al., 2006), camptothecin (Puri et al., 2005) and the bioactive compound hypericin (Kusari et al., 2008 As part of our ongoing search for novel and bioactive compounds from endophytes found in association with Asteraceae species, we have focused studies on endophytic fungi strains that showed antitumoral and antimicrobial activities (Borges and Pupo, 2006;Gallo et al., 2008;Guimarães et al., 2008;Momesso et al., 2008). These screening efforts have shown the fungal strains Fusarium spp., an endophyte in Viguiera arenaria, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, an endophyte in Viguiera robusta, as good targets to be pursued due to their moderate antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans and antitumor activity against JURKAT leukemia cell lines (Guimarães et al., 2008). We have also successfully applied endophytic fungi to the biotransformation of drugs (Borges et al., 2007(Borges et al., , 2008) ) and natural products (Verza et al., 2009). Penicillium crustosum, an endophyte in V. robusta, catalyzed stereoselective S-oxidation of the neuroleptic drug thioridazine and has been studied in the biotransformation of other bioactive natural products (unpublished data). These results encouraged us to investigate the secondary metabolites of the endophytic fungal strains Fusarium sp., C. gloeosporioides and P. crustosum.
Results and discussionCompounds 1 and 2 were isolated from the endophyte C. gloeosporioides, whereas compounds 3 and 4 were isolated from the culture of Fusarium sp. DKPs 5-7 were obtained from P. crustosum (Fig. 1).The 1 H, 13 C NMR and MS spectroscopic data of 1 coincide with previously reported data for the compound bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin, a secondary metabolite biosynthesized by the fungus Gliocladium deliquescens (Kirby et al., 1980). The absolute stereochemistry of 1 was investigated using electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and this allowed the determination of the absolute configurations of the asymmetric centers as 3(R), 6(R), 12(S) and 13(S) by comparison with previously reported data for compound 1 (Li et al., 2006). This compound is produced by irreversible disulphide bridge reduction and S-methylation of gliotoxin (Kirby et al., 1980), a well known mycotoxin. Compound 1 acts as a specific inhibitor of the platelet activating factor (IC 50 = 8.4 lM) and showed antibacterial activity against both methicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Okamoto et al., 1986;Li et al., 2006).The molecular formula of compound 2 was established by HRE-SIMS as C 14 H 16 N 2 NaO 4 S (see Section 4). 1 H, COSY, HMQC and HMBC NMR spectroscopic analyses and comparison with the data of compound 1 suggested that compound 2 is a new DKP derivative. The IR spectrum of compound 2 showed characteristic absorption bands of OH (broad, 3272 cm À1 ), amide carbonyls (1668 and 1638 cm À1 ) and one absorption band assigned to m N-H (1599 cm À1 ). The main 1 H NMR spectroscopic differences between 1 and 2 are that the later has three aromatic hydrogens and only one methyl signal for the thiomethyl group. The presence of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted phenyl ring was evident from the 1 H signals at d 6.78 (br d, J 7.7 Hz, H-11), d 6.83 (br d, J 7.7 Hz, H-9) and d 7.10 (t, J 7.7 Hz, H-10), which were coupled in the COSY spectrum. The methyl thiomethyl group at d 2.22 (s, 3H) showed long-range coupling with C-3 (d 73.7) in the HMBC spectrum. Two hydrogens of an AX spin system were observed at d 4.51 (d, J 11.9 Hz, H-14) and d 3.97 (d, J 11.9 Hz, H-14) and are attached to the oxygen substituted methylene carbon at d 63.4, and this being in agreement with a serine unit. The 1 H NMR spectrum also showed two singlets at d 3.19 (-NCH 3 ) and d 8.54 (-OH), whereas the methyl group at d 3.19 had correlations to the carbons at d 170.0 (C-5) and d 73.7 (C-3), allowing us to locate the methyl group at N-4. Two methylene hydrogens were observed at d 3.35 (m, 2H) coupled to a hydrogen at d 5.09 (dd, J 9.1; 10.3 Hz; H-6) in the COSY spectrum. Therefore, analysis of the NMR spectroscopic data suggested a DKP structure for 2 closely resembling 1. Due to the limited amount of the compound isolated, the carbon chemical shifts were obtained from the HMQC and HMBC experiments. Although seven carbons are missing, the HRESIMS and 1 H NMR data support the proposed structure. The known compound dehydrodethiogliotoxin, lacking both thiomethyl groups, is the structure most similar to compound 2 (Bell et al., 1958). Compound 2 is a new DKP derivative and is named colletopiperazine.The molecular formula of compound 3 was established as C 17 H 22 N 2 O 4 (see Section 4). The 1 H NMR spectrum had two doublets belonging to an AA 0 XX 0 spin system at d 6.86 (d, J 8.7 Hz, H-10/10 0 ) and d 7.08 (d, J 8.7 Hz, H-9/9 0 ), suggesting a para-disubstituted aromatic ring in the structure. The HMQC data showed that these hydrogens are attached to carbons at d 115.2 (C-10/10 0 ) and d 131.7 (C-9/9 0 ), respectively. The HMBC correlation between the hydrogens at d 7.08 (H-9/9 0 ) and the carbon at d 159.0 (C-11), and also the aromatic hydrogens shielded chemical shifts, suggested a group containing oxygen at C-11. A pair of methylene hydrogens was observed as two doublets at d 3.20 (d, J 13.6 Hz, H-7b) and d 3.00 (d, J 13.6 Hz, H-7a) and HMQC showed their attachment to a carbon at d 48.4 (C-7). Both methylene hydrogens are correlated to the aromatic carbons at d 131.7 (C-9/9 0 ) in the HMBC spectrum. The hydrogen at d 3.00 (H-7a) also showed long-range correlations to carbons at d 82.6 (C-6) and d 167.3 (C-5). These data suggest that methylene hydrogens H-7a and H-7b are close to the aromatic ring, to the quaternary carbon at d 82.6 and to the amide carbonyl carbon at d 167.3 of the diketopiperazine ring, indicating the presence of a tyrosine moiety in the structure. Carbon 6 was observed as a quaternary carbon in the HMQC and presented a deshielded chemical shift compared to the sulphur  (1-2) Fusarium spp. (3-4) andPenicillium crustosum (5-7).substituted carbons in compounds 1 and 2, suggesting an hydroxyl group attachment at this position. H and 13 C NMR data, and confirmed by analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The HMQC spectrum showed signals at d 1.14 (s, 3H, H-17) and d 2.14 (s, 3H, H-18), attached to carbons at d 9.4 and d 13.0, respectively, which indicated the presence of two thiomethyl groups. The NMR and optical rotation data obtained were compared with previously described data and allowed us to establish compound 4 as a DKP derivative previously isolated from Tolypocladium sp. (Chu et al., 1993) and Fusarium chlamydosporum (Usami et al., 2002). However our 1 H NMR spectroscopic data for both thiomethyl groups were inverted when compared to the first published data (Chu et al., 1993) and in agreement with later published data (Usami et al., 2002). The more shielded chemical shifts for both hydrogens and carbon of thiomethyl group at C-3 (d H 1.14, d C 9.4), compared to thiomethylgroup at C-6 (d H 2.14, d C 13.0), could be explained by a spatial proximity to the phenyl ring. NOE irradiation of H-17 (s; d 1.14) showed dipolar couplings with the aromatic hydrogens H-10 (d; d 6.80) and H-9 (d; d 7.16), confirming this close spatial relationship. This proximity would only be possible if the thiomethyl at C-3 and O-prenyltyrosine groups are in a cis configuration. In addition, compound 4 should adopt a folded conformation in order to account for the observed NOEs. Such a folded conformation has been reported for DKPs and other peptides, and it has been related with the biological activities of many compounds (Umezawa et al., 1999). The stability of 4 in this folded conformation might be explained by a CH/p interaction between the electrons of the aromatic ring and the polarized hydrogens of the thiomethyl group, similar to the stabilization of many proteins and peptides (Umezawa et al., 1999). This interaction has been confirmed by molecular modeling studies (see discussion below). Compound 4 displayed weak inhibitory activity in a PAF assay in contrast with the cis isomer which was found to be inactive (Chu et al., 1993) indicating that the spatial position of the thiomethyl group is important for this activity.The 1 H NMR spectroscopic data of compounds 5 and 6 were similar to those observed for 4, showing signals of an O-prenyltyrosine group and of two thiomethyl groups. The main difference was the presence of two additional -NCH 3 groups for both compounds. The molecular formula of compounds 5 and 6 were established as C 20 H 28 N 2 O 3 S 2 by MS. Structures were unequivocally established based on optical rotation, 1 H, 13 C NMR, NOE, HMQC and HMBC data, which are in agreement with previously published data for compounds 5 and 6 (Wang et al., 1998;Kawahara et al., 1987;Usami et al., 2002).The molecular formula of compound 7 was established as C 19 H 24 N 2 O 3 S by HRESIMS. The structure of 7 was assigned by analysis of its 1 H, 13 C, HMQC and HMBC NMR spectra. The 1 H NMR spectrum showed similarities with the 1 H NMR spectra of compounds 3-6. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 7 showed the same signals observed for the O-prenyltyrosyne previously described for compound 3. The 13 C NMR spectrum showed six quaternary carbons at d 138.2; d 159.3; d 125.6; d 130.0; d 159.2; d 163.2. The quaternary carbon chemical shifts are similar to those observed for compounds 5 and 6, except for the carbon at d 130.0, suggesting an analogue compound for 7 when compared with 5 and 6. The main differences between 5-6 and 7 were at the DKP moiety. Compound 7 showed a vinyl carbon at d 130.0 instead of one thiomethyl group. Attempts to unequivocally establish the geometry of the D 6,7 double bound through NOE irradiation did not result in reliable results. No NOEs were observed after irradiation of both H-7 and H-18 signals. However, C-7 and H-7 chemical shifts observed for 7 are in agreement with a previously related 6Z DKP derivative (Bryans et al., 1996). In order to establish the absolute configuration of 7 and also to get some insight regarding the D 6,7 configuration, experimental ECD were performed and the data obtained were compared with theoretical calculations for the four possible stereoisomers (3R,6E; 3S,6E; 3R,6Z; 3S,6Z) (see Supplementary information). The experimental ECD spectrum shows a positive Cotton effect at 311 nm ([h] 311 +1061) and a negative Cotton effect at 252 nm ([h] 252 À532). Theoretical calculations for the ECD were carried out in the solvent medium by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the PBE1PBE hybrid functional level and 6-31 + G * basis set. Although a very nice agreement is lacking between the experimental and theoretical ECD, it is still possible to assign the data to the 3R,6Z-isomer. The same approach was also carried out for compounds 2 and 3; however, the obtained data did not allow us to establish the absolute configuration by comparison between theoretical and experimental ECD spectra.Interestingly, compounds 5, 6 and 7 have been isolated from the culture of P. crustosum in the presence of 10% 1-tetralone. When P. crustosum was cultured in the absence of 1-tetralone, these compounds were not produced. Curiously, the cultivation of P. crustosum in the presence of 10% chlorogenic acid also led to the production of compounds 5 and 6, while in the absence of chlorogenic acid they were not produced. Therefore, these DKP derivatives might be related to chemical defense of the endophytic fungus.Monte Carlo algorithmic analysis (Hehre, 2003;Leach, 2001) using MMFF molecular mechanics analysis and the Spartan '06 software (Spartan, 2006) was successful in assigning low-energy conformers and in providing quantitative estimates of conformational energy differences. Thus, two low-energy conformers, one extended and another folded, have been assigned for DKPs 4 and 6 (Fig. 2).As a second step in the simulations, both the extended and folded conformations obtained for these two compounds were fully optimized in gas phase at B3LYP/6-31G * level of calculation (Spartan, 2006). Similar procedures were carried out with DKP 5, yielding mainly the extended conformation. Regarding this compound, it showed an inverted configuration at C-3 in comparison with both compounds 4 and 6. After optimization, short distances were assigned for the CH/p contacts in DKPs 4 and 6. Despite the simulations performed in the gas phase, a trend of intramolecular interactions could be observed as expected for DKPs (Umezawa et al., 1999). No significant energy differences between folded and extended conformations were observed for either compound (especially DKP 4) exhibiting a closer spatial position between their aromatic and thiomethyl groups.Compounds 1, 2, 4-7 were evaluated in the in vivo antibacterial assay using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans infected with the human opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis according to a previously described protocol (Moy et al., 2006). All the compounds did not show significant ability to promote the nematode survival.
ConclusionIn conclusion, we have isolated and identified seven DKP derivatives from three endophytic fungi, three of which are described for the first time. Isolated compounds showed no significant antimicrobial activities. Five DKP derivatives exhibit one O-prenyltyrosine group which could be considered a relatively rare peptide building block of limited distribution in nature. Phomamide, cyclo-O-(c,c-dimethylallyl)-L-tyrosyl-L-serine, was produced by the fungus Phoma lingam and appears to be the first reported O-prenyltyrosine DKP derivative from a microbial source (Ferezou et al., 1980). Approximately 46 compounds possessing an O-prenyltyrosine unit have been reported so far; however, most of them are cyclic peptides and cyclodepsipeptides. Novel N-and C-prenylated tryptophan DKP derivatives and other cyclic peptides have also been isolated from microbial sources (Schultz et al., 2008;Wang et al., 2008). Therefore, our results coincide with the assertion that endophytic fungi are outstanding sources of novel chemical diversity.
Experimental
General experimental proceduresUV spectra were obtained in methanol (MeOH) solution using a SHIMADZU PC 1520 spectrophotometer and IR spectra were measured with a Nicole Protégé 460 spectrophotometer. ECD spectra were obtained in MeOH solution using a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter. High-resolution ESI-MS data were obtained on an UltrO-TOF (Bruker-daltonics, Billarica, USA). Analytical and semi preparative HPLC analyses were carried out on a Shimadzu (LC-6AD apparatus, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD-M10Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection and processing (software Class-VP). Shim-Pack CLC-ODS, 250/4.6 C-18 and VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C 18 columns were applied as stationary phases. HPLC analyses were also carried out on a Merck Hitachi HPLC coupled with pump L-7100 Merck, refraction index detector L-7490 Merck and Borwin software. NMR experiments were recorded on BRUKER DRX-400, BRUKER DRX-500 and VARIAN INOVA-400 MHz spectrometers with CD 3 OD, DMSOd 6 and CDCl 3 as solvents and TMS as internal standard. Optical rotations were measured with a JASCO DIP-370 spectrometer. Column chromatographies were carried out on silica gel 60 (Merck, 0.063-0.200 mm), silica gel 60 C 8 reversed phase (Merck 0.063-0.200 mm) and silica gel for flash chromatography (Sigma-Aldrich, 230-400 mesh).
MicroorganismsEndophytic fungi strain codes VR7 and VR4 were isolated from V. robusta and identified as C. gloeosporioides and P. crustosum, respectively, by conventional taxonomy. Strain VR7 was identified by Fundação André Tosello, Campinas, SP, Brazil. Strain VR4 was identified by Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelculture (CBS -Fungal Biodiversity Centre), The Netherlands. Strain VA17 was isolated from V. arenaria and showed 98% identity to Fusarium spp. on the basis of its ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence (Guimarães et al., 2008). Strain VR7 showed 100% rDNA sequence identity to Glomerella cingulata. In fact, G. cingulata is the teleomorph (sexual) stage of C. gloeosporioides. The strains were maintained on potato dextrose agar slants, on agar plugs in sterile water and on silica gel (1-4 mm Synth, Brazil), stored at 4 °C, at our laboratory. The strains were deposited at the Laboratório de Química de Microorganismos, FCFRP-USP, under voucher numbers VR4, VR7 and VA17. (VA17 and VR7 sequences available in Supplementary information).
Culturing of microorganisms and isolation of diketopiperazinesC. gloeosporioides and Fusarium spp. were cultured using a twostep fermentation process. First, suspension of the mycelium was aseptically inoculated into 1000 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 mL of seed medium (Jackson et al., 1993). The flasks were incubated for 48 h at 30 °C on a rotary shaker (New Brunswick Scientific Co. Inc., model INNOVA TM 4300 -New Jersey, USA) operating at 120 rpm, with the mycelia vacuum filtered from the culture broths (discarded) and transferred into 2000 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 400 mL of Czapek fermentation medium (Alviano et al., 1992). One flask was used for C. gloeosporioides cultivation (400 mL fermentation medium) while Fusarium spp. was cultivated in 12 flasks (4800 mL fermentation medium). Cultures were incubated for an additional 6 days at 30 °C, 120 rpm. After fermentation, the culture broths of C. gloeosporioides and Fusarium spp. were separated from the mycelia by vacuum filtration and extracted with EtOAc (3 Â 150 mL for C. gloeosporioides broth and 3 Â 1800 mL for Fusarium ssp. broth) . The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum, yielding the EtOAc extracts.The EtOAc extract from C. gloeosporioides culture (123.7 mg) was subjected to silica gel 60 CC eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 4:1 (200 mL) and n-hexane/EtOAc 1:1 (100 mL) yielding 7 fractions. Sub-fraction 7 (34.1 mg), obtained from n-hexane/EtOAc 1:1, was subjected to silica gel 60 C 8 reversed-phase CC eluted with MeOH/H 2 O 1:1 (300 mL) to yield 12 fractions. Sub-fraction 6 (3.9 mg) was purified using analytical reversed-phase HPLC (Shim-Pack CLC-ODS, 250/4.6 C 18 ) with MeOH/H 2 O 1:1 as the mobile phase at a flow rate 1 mL min À1 , 260 nm to yield compounds 1 (1.1 mg; t R = 15.3 min) and 2 (1.1 mg; t R = 13.7 min).The EtOAc extract from the fermentation of Fusarium spp. (232.0 mg) was applied to a silica flash (230-400 mesh) column eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 1:1 (625 mL), 1:4 (150 mL), EtOAc (100 mL) and MeOH (400 mL), yielding 10 fractions. Sub-fraction 8 (16.0 mg), obtained from n-hexane/EtOAc 1:4 was subjected to semi preparative reversed-phase HPLC (VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C 18 ) with MeCN/H 2 O 7:13 as the mobile phase at a flow rate 4 mL min À1 , 225 nm to yield compound 3 (0.6 mg; t R = 10.6 min). The mycelium of Fusarium spp. was extracted by maceration with MeOH for 7 days at room temperature. After this period, the mycelium was separated from the culture broth by vacuum filtration and discarded. The organic solvent was concentrated to yield the MeOH crude extract (9.4 g), which was suspended in MeOH/ H 2 O 1:3 (400 mL) and partitioned with CH 2 Cl 2 and EtOAc, in sequence, both for three consecutive times (150 mL each). The CH 2 Cl 2 fraction was concentrated in vacuo, resuspended in MeOH (100 mL) and partitioned with n-hexane (3 Â 100 mL). The MeOH fraction was combined with the EtOAc fraction yielding a crude extract (974.9 mg). This extract was subjected to silica gel 60 CC eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 4:1 (300 mL), 1:1 (680 mL), EtOAc (100 mL) and MeOH (200 mL), yielding 9 fractions. Sub-fraction 7 spontaneously crystallized (11.4 mg) and the precipitate was washed with MeOH yielding compound 4 (6.7 mg).P. crustosum was cultivated in 35 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL) containing 200 mL of Czapek medium (Alviano et al., 1992). The flasks were incubated for 72 h at 25 °C on a rotary shaker operating at 200 rpm. The mycelia were vacuum filtered from the culture broth (discarded) and transferred into 35 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL) containing 200 mL of Czapek medium without glucose and supplemented with 20 mg of 1-tetralone per flask. After fermentation, the culture broth of P. crustosum was separated from the respective mycelia by vacuum filtration and extracted with EtOAc (3 Â 100 mL each flask). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum yielding the EtOAc extract. The EtOAc extract from P. crustosum (700 mg) was subjected to silica gel 60 CC eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 7:3 (350 mL), 3:7 (350 mL) and EtOAc (350 mL), yielding 6 fractions. Sub-fraction 4 (81.4 mg), obtained from n-hexane/EtOAc 3:7, was subjected to semi preparative normal phase HPLC (LiChroCART 250-10-LiChrospher Si 60, 10 lm), mobile phase n-hexane/EtOAc 7:3 at a flow rate 3 mL min À1 , refractive index detector (RID) to yield compounds 5 (7.4 mg; t R = 22.6 min), 6 (33.5 mg; t R = 79.4 min) and 7 (1.5 mg; t R = 62.3 min). Cultivation of P. crustosum under the same conditions as previously described, but adding of chlorogenic acid (20 mg) per flask, instead of 1-tetralone at the fermentation step, also led to production of a crude extract containing compounds 5 and 6. Compounds 5 and 6 were identified in the crude extract using1 H NMR spectroscopic and analytical HPLC analyses using the previously isolated compounds 5 and 6 as standards. P. crustosum was cultivated at the same conditions, but with no addition of either 1-tetralone or chlorogenic acid for control purposes, and HPLC profile analyses of both cultures did not show the production of 5-7.Compound 2 (colletopiperazine). Amorphous white powder; ½a  1.
Molecular modeling proceduresConformational search was performed on DKPs 4, 5 and 6 using the MONTE CARLO method with the MMFF molecular mechanics model, thus implemented in the Spartan '06 1.1.2 software (Spartan, 2006). Two main low-energy conformations (extended and folded) were obtained and investigated for both compounds 4 and 6. Such conformers as well as the extended conformation of compound 5 were then fully optimized in gas phase at B3LYP/6-31G * level of calculation. All of the quantum chemical methods used here were implemented in the Spartan '06 1.1.2 software.
Computational methodology for ECDTheoretical calculations for the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) were carried out in the solvent medium by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the PBE1PBE hybrid functional level and 6-31 + G * basis set. The choice of the functional was based on a recent extensive benchmarking (Jacquemin et al., 2009) comparing the merits of LDA, GGA, meta-GGA, global hybrids, and long-range corrected hybrids in the prediction of singlet-excited states of (bio)-organic molecules and dyes. The PBE1PBE, also called PBE0 (Jacquemin et al., 2009), was one of the best functional matching the reference data. Although not shown, we have performed the calculations using the triple zeta basis set but only minor differences were found. Thus, only calculations with 6-31 + G * basis set are shown. Solvent effect (methanol) was included in the predictions using the Conductor Polarizable Continuum Model (CPCM). Rotational strengths (R), the parameter representing the intensity and sign of a Cotton effect, were calculated by the Rosenfeld expression. In our case, the dipole velocity and dipole length forms for R were identical. For comparison between the theoretical and experimental ECD, the line spectrum is convoluted with Gaussian line shapes and scaled by the maximum value of the experimental data. On average, the Gaussian line shapes are taking into account the uncertainty principle, vibronic terms and interactions with the medium. All TDDFT calculations including CPCM were performed with Gaussian03 suite of programs (Frisch et al., 2003).Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.

Two hydrogens at d 4.50(d, J  6.8 Hz, were coupled to a vinyl hydrogen at d 5.40 (br t, J 6.8 Hz, H-13), which was observed as a broad triplet suggesting a long-range coupling with methyl hydrogens observed at d 1.80 (br s, H-15) and d 1.74 (br s, H-16). Methyl hydrogens gave longrange correlations with both vinyl carbons at d 119.7 (C-13) and d 138.9 (C-14), suggesting a prenyl group attached to a tyrosine moiety. An alanine unit linked to the O-prenyltyrosine moiety was evident from the 1 H NMR spectrum by the presence of an AX spin system at d 2.75 (d, J 17.6 Hz, 1H) and d 3.50 (d, J 17.6 Hz, 1H). Finally, the HMBC spectrum showed correlations among methyl group at d 2.84 (s, H-17) and carbons at d 52.1 (C-3) and d 167.3 (C-5), allowing the location of one methyl group to N-4. Compound 3, fusaperazine C, was found to be a new Oprenyltyrosine DKP derivative.The molecular formula of compound 4 was established as C 18 H 24 N 2 O 3 S 2 according to MS and NMR spectroscopic data. The NMR data showed similarities with the previously described DKP derivative 3. The O-prenyltyrosine moiety was evident from both 1
