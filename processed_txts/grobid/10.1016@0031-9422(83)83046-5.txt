NEOLIGNANS FROM OCOTEA CATHARINENSIS*
The trunk bark of Ocotea catharinensis yielded, besides the known bicyclo(3.2.l)octanoid neolignans canellin-C and 5'-methoxycanellin-C, two epimers rel-( lR,4S and 4R,

INTRODUCTIONThe wood of Ocotea catharinensis Mez is a much appreciated article of commerce [2). The tree, popularly known as 'canela preta', occurs in the Atlantic forest. A specimen was collected in the Cunha region, %o Paulo State, and identified by Professor Klaus Kubitzki, University of Hamburg. Fractionation of the light petrol extract of its bark gave the neolignans la, lb, Za, 2b, 3a, 4a and 5a. For reasons stated in a previous paper of this series [3], nomenclature and numbering of neolignans follow the rules outlined in a recent review [4].  Compounds 2a and 2b have been isolated respectively from Licaria canella (Meissn.) Kosterm. [S] and from Aniba williamsii 0. C. Schmidt. The analysed samples of the latter species were originally designated A. simulans Allen [6], an error which was recently corrected [7]. We have indicated previously that compounds of type 2 should be artifacts of isolation [8]. Indeed, the putative precursors of 2a, namely la and lb, are also present in the extract of 0. catharinensis.As expected [S], compound la in chloroform is demethylated into 2a in 561 the presence of a trace of acid at room temperature. Compounds la and lb show very similar IR and mass spectra. According to their 'H and 13C NMR data they differ only with respect to the configuration of the hydroxyl group at C-4', endo-oriented in la (y-effects on C-7 and C-6' for la vs 1 beach 6 -2.0) and exo-oriented in lb (y-effect on C-2' for lb vs la 64.  . burcheki [ 141. As in the case of 4a, the sole constitutional difference between the novel 5a and the model compound 5b is the presence of an additional methoxyl at C-3' of the former. Stereochemically, 5a, 5b and 9 do not show the methyl protection (61.31 kO.06) which exists in 8 (Me-8,SO.93) due to the c&relationship of the aryl and methyl groups. The 7S, l'R-configurations are deduced for 5a in view, respectively, of its negative Cotton effects at 280 nm which it shares with 5b and 9, and at 315 nm which is shares with 5b and 8. Positive Cotton effects at 280 and 315 nm respectively, are diagnostic for the 7R-configuration in 8 and the 1'S configuration in 9 [13]. *Part LXIX in the series " The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae".

2). Acetylation (acetic anhydride, pyridine) at room temperature transformed la into the monoacetate lc, and lb into the diacetate le. Complete acetylation of la into Id required heating. The monoacetate lc is constitutionally identical with 6, a compound isolated from Ocotea sp. [S]. Stereochemically the compounds differ in the configurations of the aryl group at C-7 and the methyl group at C-8. The former is endo-situated in 6, exerting protection on the acetate protons (61.54) and exo-situated in lc (acetate, 62.14). The latter is exo-situated in 6 (Me-& 6 1.14) and endo-situated in lc, suffering protection by the bicycle-octane system (60.85). Spectral comparison of 3a and of its diacetate 3b, the latter prepared by acetylation (acetic anhydride, pyridine) of the former at room temperature, with 3c from Aniba wikamsii [6, 71 showed that all differences can be accounted for by the absence of methoxyl substitution of the aromatic ring in 3a and 3b. Structure 4a was established by 'H and 13C NMR as well as ORD comparison with 4b from Aniba terminalis Ducke [IS, 101 and 7 from A. burchellii Kosterm. [9, 11, 121. The sole constitutional difference between the novel 4a and the model compounds is the presence of an additional methoxyl group at C-3' of the former. Stereochemically, 4a is identical with 4b, both showing the absence of the reciprocal y-effect of C-9 (6 11.95 ) 0.05) and C-7' (643.85 ~fr 0.05) which exists in 7 with &-C-9 (?~8.3)/C-7' (636.6) [9J; both showing the protection exerted by the aryls on the C-methyl protons (60.50) which is absent from 7 with frans-Ar/Me (6 1.16) [9]; and both showing positive/negative Cotton effects which are negative/positive at the same wavelengths, respectively 260/295 nm, for 7 [ 131. Structure Sa was established by IH and i3C NMR comparison with 5b from Aniba terminalis [lo, 141, as well as by ORD comparison with Jb and 8 from A. williamii [ 151 and 9 from A
EXPERIMENTALIsolation ojthe constifuents of0. catharinensis. Dry trunk bark was powdered (1.2 kg) and percolated with petrol. The extract (5Og) was chromatographed (CC-l) on Si gel [300 g, petrollEtOAc (9:1), fractions of 200 ml]. Fractions 35 and 36 (15 g) were rechromatographed (CC-2) on Si gel [200 g, CHCI,-EtOAc (191). fractions of 100 ml]. Fractions 13-23 were purified on an alumina column (CC-3) (petrol-EtOAc, 9:l) to a binary mixture which, on a Si gel column (CC-4) (Et,O), gave Sa (2 g). Fractions 24-28 (CC-2) were rechromatographed (CC-5) on Si gel (100 g, CHCI,. fractions of 50 ml). TLC of fractions 2247 (CC-5) on Si gel developed with CHCl, -EtOAc (41) and then on Si gel developed with C,H, EtOAc (4:l) gave 3a (70 mg) and la
