Antioxidant phenolic and quinonemethide triterpenes from Cheiloclinium cognatum
The triterpenes, 22b-hydroxypristimerin and cognatine, were isolated together with the known compounds pristimerin, maytenin, 20a-hydroxymaytenin, 22b-hydroxymaytenin, netzahualcoyol, netzahualcoyondiol and netzahualcoyone from root bark of Cheiloclinium cognatum. The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by interpretation of their spectral data, including gHMQC and gHMBC experiments.The isolates were investigated for their radical scavenging abilities through a spectrophotometric assay involving reduction of 2,2-diphenyl-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH).

IntroductionThe Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families are rich sources of quinonemethide triterpenes (Br€ uning and Wagner, 1978;Gunatilaka, 1996), and these compounds have a variety of biological activities such as antitumor (Bhatnagar et al., 1979;Gonc ßalves de Lima et al., 1971), antimicrobial (Ferreira de Santana et al., 1971); antibiotic (Gonc ßalves de Lima et al., 1969;Gonzalez et al., 1977); cytotoxic (Setzer et al., 1998) and antimalarial (Pavanand et al., 1989;Figueiredo et al., 1998) properties. Systematic studies on Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae plant species (Corsino et al., 1998a(Corsino et al., ,b,c, 2000(Corsino et al., , 2003;;Buffa Filho et al., 2002) have been concerned with biosynthesis of quinonemethide triterpenes, the main secondary metabolites in this taxon. The biosynthetic study dealing on Maytenus aquifolium (Celastraceae) and Salacia campestris (Hippocrateaceae) indicated that friedelane triterpenes are putative precursors of quinonemethide triterpenes, which are biosynthesized in the leaves and translocated to the root bark, where these compounds would be transformed into quinonemethide triterpenes (Corsino et al., 2000). These findings have led us to investigate other species of Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae. Cheiloclinium cognatum (Miers) A.C. Sm. (Hippocrateaceae) a tree widely distributed in the Cerrado region of Brazil, was selected to investigate the oxidative transformation on the E ring of the quinonemethide triterpenes. With this objective, we carried out a chemical study on this plant species, which led to the isolation of two new triterpenes, 22b-hydroxypristimerin (1) and cognatine (2), besides seven known quinonemethide triterpenes; pristimerin (3), maytenin (4), 22b-hydroxymaytenin (5), 20a-hydroxymaytenin (6), netzahualcoyonol (7), netzahualcoyondiol (8) and netzahualcoyone (9). The free radical scavenging activities of the isolates have been evaluated through a spectrophotometric assay using the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-picryl hydrazyl(DPPH).
Results and discussionA CH 2 Cl 2 soluble fraction obtained from the ethanolic extract of the root bark C. cognatum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography. The fractions obtained were further purified by preparative TLC and/ or HPLC, affording compounds 1-9.22b-Hydroxypristimerin (1), obtained as a red amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C 30 H 40 O 5 by analysis of its ESI/MS spectrum, elemental analysis and 13 C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 3450 cm À1 (hydroxyl group) and 1724 and 1645 cm À1 (carbonyl groups). The 1 H NMR spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of six methyl singlets at d 2.13, 1.38, 1.22, 1.15, 0.99 and 0.41, attributed to H 3 -23, H 3 -25, H 3 -26, H 3 -30, H 3 -28 and H 3 -27, respectively, (Table 1). The quinonemethide moiety was characterized by a doublet at d 6.26 (1H, J ¼ 6:5 Hz), a singlet at d 6.41 (1H) and a doublet at d 6.94 (1H, J ¼ 6:5 Hz) attributed to H-7, H-1 and H-6, respectively. The singlet at d 2.13, characteristic of a methyl group attached to a sp 2 carbon (H 3 -23), corroborated the presence of a quinonemethide system. Further oxygenated functional groups were assumed to be hydroxyl and ester on the basis of NMR spectral analysis. The 13 C NMR, gHMBC and gHMQC spectra (Table 2) showed the presence of 30 carbons in 1.In the 13 C NMR spectrum two carbonyl carbon signals (d 178.2 and d 178.3) attributed to C-29 and C-2, respectively, six methyl carbons (d 38.1, 32.2, 24.0, 21.6, 19.0 and 10.1), six methylene carbons (d 38.1, 36.1, 33.5, 30.8, 29.5 and 28.2), four methine carbons (d 134.0, 119.5, 118.0 and 46.1), 10 quaternary carbons (d 169.7, 164.6, 146.0, 127.3, 117.2, 44.5, 42.6, 42.4, 39.2 and 38.2), one methoxyl carbon (d 51.6) and one hydroxymethine carbon (d 67.9) were observed. The assignments were based on gHMQC and gHMBC spectra and by comparison with published data on pristimerin (Gunatilaka, 1989(Gunatilaka, , 1996)). The correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum from the singlet at d 0.99 (H 3 -28) to the hydroxymethine carbon at d 67.9 (Fig. 1) and the signals at d 36.1 (C-16), 38.1 (C-17) and 46.1 (C-18), confirmed the attachment of the hydroxyl group at C-22. The relative stereochemistry of H-22 was deduced by the coupling constant values (d 4.02, J 22ax=21ax ¼ 11:0 Hz and J 22ax=21eq ¼ 4:0 Hz), which corroborated the equatorial orientation of the hydroxyl group. The ester group was confirmed by a singlet at d 3.50 (3H) attributed to a methoxyl portion of the ester group at C-29, which was confirmed by means of correlation of the methyl group at d 1.15 (C-30) with the carbonyl carbon of the ester group at d 178.2 (C-29) observed in the gHMBC spectrum (Fig. 1). The structure of 1 was determined as 22bhydroxypristimerin.Cognatine (2), isolated as a pale yellow amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C 31 H 38 O 7 by means of analysis of ESI/MS data, elemental analysis and 13 C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxyl group at 3438 cm À1 and carbonyl groups at 1718 and 1643 cm À1 . Its 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of two singlets at d 6.85 (1H), attributed to H-1 and at d 6.00 (1H) assigned to H-7. Also, two methoxyl groups signals at d 3.73 and 3.74 (3H, each) were observed, which were characterized as methoxyl groups attached to C-3 and belonging to the ester group at C-   32.2 q 13.7 q 17.5 s 13.7 s 13.6 s OCH 3 -29 51.6 q 52.7 q 52.3s 52.7 s 52.6 s OCH 3 -3 -61.7 q --a Multiplicities of carbons were determined by a DEPT 134°experiment.  The known compounds pristimerin (3), maytenin (4), 22b-hydroxymaytenin (5) and 20a-hydroxymaytenin (6) were identified by comparison with published data (Gunatilaka, 1989;Gunatilaka, 1996;Dhanabalasingham et al., 1996;Furlan et al., 1990). Compounds 7-9 had been previously isolated from Orthosphenia mexicana (Gonz alez et al., 1983), but a number of inconsistencies were found regarding the assignments of published 13 C NMR data. The analysis of 2D NMR spectra allowed accurate assignment of 13 C NMR signals mostly based on gHMQC and gHMBC experiments.The spectrophotometric assay using DPPH indicated a prominent free radical scavenging activity for some of the isolated quinonemethide triterpenes (Fig. 3). The stable free radical DPPH has an absorption maximum at 517 nm, which decreases upon reduction through reaction with an antioxidant compound. The free radical scavenging activity of quinonemethide triterpenes is mostly due to the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety with extended conjugation through ring B, e.g. in compounds 1 and 3-6 or B-D, e.g. in compounds 7-9. These features stabilize the quinonemethide free radical promptly formed after loss of one radical hydrogen, donated to the DPPH. The more extended conjugations of triterpenes 7-9 account for their higher free radical scavenging abilities (ca. 45% inhibition at 60 lM) when compared to compounds 1-6 (less than 30% inhibition at 60 lM). The phenolic triterpene 2 exhibited the lowest activity (18% at 60 lM) probably due to the lack of conjugation through rings B-D. The free radical scavenging ability of the quinonemethide triterpenes and a standard compound rutin (66% inhibition at 60 lM) are due to catechol moiety present in the B ring of rutin the C2-C3 double bond (van Acker et al., 1996). The synthetic antioxidant BHT (11% inhibition at 60 lM) exhibited the weakest antiradical activity as expected due to its slow reaction rate with DPPH (Bondet et al., 1997).
Experimental
Plant materialRoot barks of C. cognatum (Hippocrateaceae) were collected at Universidade Federal de Goi as, Goiânia, GO and identified by Dr J ulio Antônio Lombardi (Departamento de Botânica do Institute de Ciências Biolôgicas -Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, UFMG). A voucher specimen (No. 19797) is deposited at Herbarium of Institute de Ciências Biolôgicas -UFG, Goi as.
Instrumentation and chromatographySilica gel (Merck, were used for CC unless otherwise stated and solvents were distilled prior to use. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl 3 as solvent and TMS as reference. HPLC separations were performed using a Shimadzu LC-10AS. Preparative HPLC separation were performed on a Varian PROSTAR, using a reversed phase column (Phenomenex-Luna C 18 , 21.2 Â 250 mm, 10 lm), eluted with MeOH:H 2 O (7:3, with 0.05% H 3 PO 4 ) detection at 420 nm. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ESI-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elemental Analyser 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer.
Extraction and isolation of constituentsDried and powdered root barks of C. cognatum (690.0 g) were extracted with EtOH. The resulting EtOH extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a brown gum (210.6 g), which was submitted to liquidliquid partitioning. The CH 2 C1 2 soluble part of the EtOH extract was concentrated in vacuo (25.5 g), submitted to a silica gel column (600 g, 70-230 mesh) eluted with a hexane/EtOAc gradient, yielding 41 fractions (A 1 -A 41 ). Fraction A 9 -A 11 (1.48 g) was submitted to a flash silica gel CC (230-400 mesh), eluted with a hexane/ EtOAc gradient resulting in 32 fractions (B 1 -B 41 ). Fraction B 10 -B 14 (0.154 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] yielding compound 3 (55 mg). Fraction B 18 -B 21 (0.085 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] affording compound 4 (34 mg). Fraction A 16 -A 17 (3.55 g) was submitted to flash silica gel CC (70-230 mesh), eluted with hexane/EtOAc gradient, resulting in 46 fractions (C 1 -C 46 ). Fraction C 19 -C 23 (0.221 g) was submitted to a reversed phase prep. HPLC [MeOH:H 2 O (7:3), k ¼ 420 nm, 10 ml min À1 ] to afford compounds 1 (63 mg) and 8 (65 mg). Fraction A 22 -A 26 (2.46 g) was subjected to a flash silica gel CC eluted with hexane/EtOAc gradient, resulting in 77 fractions (D 1 -D 77 ). Fraction D 23 -D 27 was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1), AcOH 0.05%] affording compounds 5 (13 mg) and 6 (23 mg). Fraction D 17 -D 22 was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1), AcOH 0,05%, three elutions] and further purified by reversed phase prep. HPLC [MeOH:H 2 O (7:3), k ¼ 420 nm, 10 mL min À1 ] affording compounds 7 (18 mg) and 2 (4 mg).
Radical scavenging activity on DPPH radicalRadical scavenging activity was assayed according to the Blois method (Blois, 1958). The free radical scavenging capacities of quinonemethide triterpenes and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated based on their ability to reduce the free radical already assigned (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubilized in methanol (10 ml) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 to 100 lM were then prepared in MeOH and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated (see Fig. 3).
