FUNGITOXIC NON-GLYCOSIDIC IRIDOIDS FROM ALIBERTIA MACROPHYLLA
The aqueous alcohol extract of the leaves of Alibertia macrophylla afforded two epimeric pairs of iridoid aglycones and one of them showed high inhibitory activity against Aspergillus niger, Ciadosporium sphaerospermum, C. cladosporioides and Colletotrichum gloesporioides. Three of the compounds are reported for the !irst time from natural sources. Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic studies, mainly through 13C NMR analysis.

WTRODUci'IONSeveral tropical Brazilian Rubiaceae species from the rain forest and 'cerrado', produce phytoalexins in response to fungal inoculation [l J. It has been shown that the response is dependent on the seasonal conditions. Among 15 assayed species, Alibertia macrophylla K. Schum. and A. myrcijolia Spruce ex. Schum. have shown negative phytoalexin response all year round. On the other hand, the species of Alibertia contain the highest quantities of diffusable phenols, although no fungitoxic activity had been detected [23. Furthermore, extracts obtained from leaves of A. macrophyzla have revealed, after TLC bioassays, three different fungitoxic zones [Z]. Phytochemical studies evidenced that two caiTeic acid esters, one of them with antifungal activity, should correspond to one of the inhibitory zones [3]. In addition, another fraction that showed strong inhibitory activity against fungal growth was analysed. The isolation and structural elucidation of the compounds of this fraction revealed the presence of the epimeric mixtures of non-glycosidic iridoids la-ld. The aglycones lb, le and ld are being reported for the first time from natural sources. In this paper we present the structure elucidation of these compounds and the bioassay results with one of the iridoid epimeric pairs.
RESULTS AND DISCUSMONThe 40% aqueous alcohol extract prepared from dried and powdered leaves of A. macrophylla was submitted to partition into hexane and ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetatesoluble fraction was examined by TLC and three fungitoxic zones (R, 0.22,0.36 and 0.65) were detected, using a spore suspension of  preparative TLC to provide two pairs of epimeric iridoid aglycones la, lb and lc, Id. The 'HNMR (Table 1) and 13CNMR (Table 2) spectral data for la and lb revealed an iridoidal skeleton with a carbomethoxy substituent at C-4 and a methyl group at C-8. These data resemble those which were reported for the aglycone loganetin [S, 63. The close similarity of their UV absorption maxima and their molecular ions at m/z 228, pointed to loganetin as one of the isomers. This assumption was confirmed by 'jCNMR chemical shifts and multiplicities (DEPT). Taking the "CNMR 6 values assigned to loganetin as reference data [S, 63, it could be deduced that the epimeric mixture was at C-l.The W absorption maxima and molecular ions obtained for lc and Id were identical to those observed for la and lb. The analysis of the 'HNMR (Table 1) and ' 3C NMR (Table 2) data evidenced that lc and Id are also iridoidal aglycones whose skeleton must be the same as that of la and lb. The main differences observed in the 13C NMR spectra correspond to the carbinolic carbons at S78.8/78.5 and to the methyl groups at 6 16.9/15.1. To elucidate the differences in the substitution pattern of lc and Id, 'HNMR correlated ~~ctros~py COSY was used to assign all resonance signals in the 'HNMR spectra. The carbinolic protons at 64.15 (3=9.0; 6.7; 2.8 Hz)/6420 (J =6.5; 2.5; 1.5 Hz) were consistent with H-C-6. Besides, it was evidenced that the protons at C-l   -.-.-

[SK10 (J = 6.0Hz)/65.40 (J = 3.0Hz)], show correlation with the protons at C-9 cS2.22 dt (J= 8.2; 5.5 Hz)/ 62.35 dt (J = 7.2; 3.5 Hz)]. Comparison of the 13C NMR data of lc and Id with those for dihydrocornin [73 indicated this iridoidal system for lc and Id; the observed differences between them are due to the size and functionality of the glucose moiety present in dihydrocornin. Thus it was possible to propose that one of the isomers corresponded to the aglycone of dihydrocornin and the other would be its epimer at C-l. The acetylation (Ac,O/pyridine) of la, lb and lc, Id confirmed the position of epimerization. The P-configuration assigned to the acetyl function at C-l of le and If was deduced mainly through analysis of the H-l chemical shift and J, 9 values recorded in the 'H NMR spectra of these derivatives. On the basis of the Karplus rule for dihedral angles between H-l and H-9, the pseudoequato~al position of the substituent at C-l was revealed since dihedral angles of ca 118 ' were observed for lc (J1 ,., = 3.5 Hz) and If (5, 9 = 3.2 Hz). This assumption is quite consistent with previously reported considerations of changes in the different hemi-chair conformations of the flexible dihydropyran ring of iridoi-da1 systems [7JThe epimeric pair lc and ld, corresponding to the R, 0.36 zone, showed antifungal activity against As~r~ilZus niger, C~adosp~r~~~ sp~aeros~er~u~, C. ~l~ospor~oides and Col~etotric~u~ ~loesporioides.The acetyl derivatives were similarly assayed with C. spherospermum and also displayed growth inhibitory activity. No previous report was found concerning the occurrence of these iridoids as natural aglycones and their presence and biological activity suggest that they can play a defensive role against fungal attack.
