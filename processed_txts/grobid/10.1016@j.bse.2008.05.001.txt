Intraspecific variability of flavonoid glycosides and styrylpyrones from leaves of Cryptocarya mandioccana Meisner (Lauraceae)
Chemical variability in populations of Cryptocarya mandioccana Meisner was investigated using chromatographic profiles of flavonoid glycosides and styrylpyrones from leaves of 57 trees from three sites in the Atlantic rain forest of Sa ˜o Paulo State -Brazil. The flavonoid profiles of the leaves from all trees were similar. However, four chemotypes were recognized by qualitative and quantitative differences in styrylpyrones. Chemotype F showed lower contents of these polyketides than chemotypes FS1, FS2 and FS3, which were characterized by styrylpyrones formed from different numbers of acetate units. Chemotypes with higher levels of styrylpyrones were more frequent in southern regions, with soils of higher K þ , Ca 2þ and Mg 2þ content. Soil and climate could indicate a genetic or environmental influence on styrylpyrones in leaves of C. mandioccana.

IntroductionCryptocarya mandioccana is widely distributed in the Atlantic rain forest of Brazil. The trees are 15-30 m high and 20-104 cm in diameter at breast height, presented bisexual flowers and 2n (24) chromosomes (de Moraes and Gardingo, 1996). The fruits are widely consumed by primates such as brown howler monkeys (Alouatta fusca), brown capuchins (Cebus apella), muriquis (Brachyteles arachnoids), and cracids (Pipele jacutinga and Penelope obscura) (de Moraes and Paoli, 1995). Although the current nomenclature is C. mandioccana Meisner, in our previous papers (Cavalheiro and Yoshida, 2000;Marchetti et al., 2006;Nehme et al., 2002Nehme et al., , 2005;;de Moraes and Derbyshire, 2004;de Moraes and Gardingo, 1996;de Moraes and Monteiro, 2002;de Moraes and Paoli, 1995) we have used the name Cryptocarya moschata Nees & Martius owing to a nomenclature problem (de Moraes, 2005). Phytochemical studies of the bark of C. mandioccana revealed the presence of several styrylpyrones (Cavalheiro and Yoshida, 2000), whilst in leaves the main secondary metabolites were flavonoid glycosides and styrylpyrones (Nehme et al., 2002(Nehme et al., , 2005)).The production of secondary metabolites can be affected by genetic, ontogenetic and environmental factors including age of individuals, seasonality, level of nutrients, osmotic stress and photoperiod (Gobbo-Neto and Lopes, 2007). Indeed, in nature there are great differences even between individuals, especially amongst those with a normal breeding rate (Harborne and Turner, 1984). Several reasons have been proposed to explain such phenotypic polymorphism including recurrent mutations and genetic drift (Jones, 1973). The identification of polymorphic forms within species (chemotypes) can help to understand the distribution, origin and the mechanisms of interaction between these chemotypes as well as the co-evolution with others species. Considering that genes involved in secondary metabolism are expressed at low levels compared with those of primary metabolism, different genes can be isolated from chemotypes presenting dissimilar pattern of secondary compounds using differential display analysis for instance (Yamazaki and Saito, 2002).Studies on the chemical variability of a population of C. mandioccana (former C. moschata) have demonstrated the occurrence of two chemotypes (named FS and F) presenting dissimilar styrylpyrone profiles (Nehme et al., 2002), although the composition of the leaf essential oil did not vary significantly with circadian or seasonal rhythm (Telascrea et al., 2006;Marchetti et al., 2006). Evaluation of the genetic structure of populations of C. mandioccana using isozyme markers has shown a high level of genetic variability within this species compared with other angiosperms. In addition, such a large variability was found to be greater within populations than amongst populations, and in the latter case the pronounced variability was explained by gene flow (de Moraes and Monteiro, 2002;de Moraes and Derbyshire, 2004).In the present work, trees of three natural populations of C. mandioccana were selected to investigate (i) the variability concerning two classes of polyketides (flavonoids and styrylpyrones); (ii) the influence of soil macronutrients on the production of these compounds; and (iii) the relationship between chemotypes and soil characteristics.
Materials and methods
Plant materialFifty-seven trees of C. mandioccana were randomly selected from three different areas of Atlantic rain forest in the State of Sa ˜o Paulo, Brazil. Sampling was performed at similar time of the year and day to minimize seasonal and circadian effects. Eight trees were sampled in September and November 1998, 28 trees were sampled in October and November 1999 and 21 trees were sampled twice, in September and November 1998, and in October and November 1999 (Table 1). Samples were collected between 9:00 and 16:00 hours. All plants were identified by Dr. Pedro L. R. Moraes, and the voucher specimens were deposited in the Herbarium Maria Eneyda P. Kaufmann Fidalgo (Sa ˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil).
Study areasPlants were collected from three natural reserves of Atlantic rain forest: Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho, Nu ´cleo Sa ˜o Miguel Arcanjo (area coded CB, 24 04 0 S; 47 58 0 W), Estaça ˜o Ecolo ´gica Jure ´ia-Itatins, Nu ´cleo Arpoador (area coded JI; 24 23 0 S; 47 02W), Parque Estadual Serra do Mar, Nu ´cleo Picinguaba (area coded SM; 23 20 0 S; 44 50 0 W). The approximate distances between the areas are: from CB to JI is 120 km, from CB to SM is 260 km, and from JI to SM is 350 km. Voucher specimens for the samples collected at CB, JI and SM were deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Bota ˆnica de Sa ˜o Paulo under the reference numbers CAVALHEIRO CB230, 231, 283, 293, 300, 301, 302, 256, 353, 354, 313, 314, 316, 317 andXCM, NuBBE NP 0001 -0025 andCAVALHEIRO JU 2001 -2021, respectively.
Sample preparationOn average 20 leaves were collected from each tree, cleaned with a cloth and stored in a plastic bag at À18 C. Prior to solvent extraction, leaves were dried at 40 C for 24 h and milled. Powdered leaves (120 g) were placed in a centrifuge tube, extracted with petrol (4.0 ml, bp 60-68 C) under constant sonication for 30 min, followed by addition of MeOH (2.0 ml) and 10% aqueous HOAc (2.0 ml; v/v), and sonication for further 30 min. Then, this mixture was stirred and centrifuged at 1200g, for 15 min. An aliquot (1.0 ml) was taken from the aqueous-alcoholic phase, filtered on a 0.45 mm PTFE membrane and submitted to HPLC analysis, by injection of 20 mL (Nehme et al., 2005). All samples were prepared in triplicate.
HPLC conditionsChromatographic analyses were carried out on a Supelcosil LC-18 column (250 Â 4.6 mm, 5 mm) with a Supelcosil LC -18 guard column. The column was eluted with acetonitrile (A) and phosphate/triethylamine buffer, pH 2 (B), in gradient mode (A/B 15:85 to A/B 40:60, over 45 min), flow rate of 0.7 ml/min (Nehme et al., 2005), using a UV-vis diode array detector (PDA). Chromatograms obtained at 254 nm were integrated and the areas of 20 main peaks were used as variables for statistical analysis.
Identification of secondary metabolitesFlavonoid glycosides were eluted between 12 and 21 min showed intense absorptions at 205, 255 and 350 nm. Styrylpyrones eluted between 25 and 35 min showed intense absorptions at 204 and 250 nm and weak absorptions at 282 and 290 nm. The main compounds, identified by UV spectra and relative retention time (Nehme et al., 2005), were quer- S3), cryptomoschatone F1 (S4), deacetylcryptocaryalactone (S5), cryptofolione (S6) and cryptomoschatone E2 (S7).

Soil analysisSoil samples were collected from the three different places at the base of each tree, mixed up together and analyzed. The contents of P (mg/L), K (mmol c /L), Ca (mmol c /L), Mg (mmol c /L), organic matter (g/L), pH and potential acidity (H þ Al, mmol c / L) were evaluated according to the method reported by Van Raij et al.

Statistical analysisThe data set of secondary metabolites including 20 variables, peak areas for 6 flavonoid glycosides, 7 styrylpyrones and 7 unidentified compounds, was measured in 57 trees, of which 21 of them were collected in 1998 and 1999, and 36 collected in 1998 or 1999; a total of 78 cases (Table 1). Each matrix entry is an average of two replications. The data were auto-scaled before the analysis. The chemical similarity of the trees was verified through incremental hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) using Euclidean distance as the measurement of similarity between individuals. For a more consistent clustering, the similarity distance was defined after checking whether all trees sampled twice were included in the same cluster. HCA was performed by Ein*Sight 3.0 program (Informetrix Inc., 1991 -Seattle, WA). Discriminant analysis using a backward stepwise method was performed by Statistica 5.1G program (StatSoft Inc.,Tulsa, USA).
Results and discussionHierarchical cluster analysis of 78 cases (36 trees sampled once and 31 trees sampled twice) and 20 peaks relating to secondary metabolites as variables showed that the 57 C. mandioccana trees collected in the Atlantic rain forest could be clustered in four chemotypes, named F, FS1, FS2 and FS3 (Fig. 2). Comparisons between the chromatographic profiles of trees sampled in 1998 and 1999 showed quantitative differences concerning the content of secondary metabolite, which could be attributed to seasonal or circadian rhythms of secondary metabolism (Figs. 345). Therefore, the robustness of clustering analysis was improved by grouping, in the same cluster, the cases involving the same tree obtained in two different years (1998 and 1999). For example, the samples CB283/98 and CB283/99 presented large quantitative variability with respect to their secondary metabolites, although the qualitative chemical profiles were similar, therefore they were  classified in the same group according to cluster similarity. Using backward stepwise discriminant analysis, it was possible to classify all cases in four chemical groups using only four variables, which were related to styrylpyrones S2, S5, S6 and S7 (Table 2 and Fig. 6). Chemotype F could be characterized by a predominance of flavonoid glycosides (F1-F6) and low content of styrylpyrones. Chemotypes FS1, FS2 and FS3 presented at least one intense peak attributed to styrylpyrones, whilst differing from each other in the number of acetate units in their polyketides. In chemotype FS1, the most intense peak was attributed to deacetylcryptocaryalactone (S5), which is biosynthesized from cinnamate and three acetate units. Chemotype FS2 showed three intense styrylpyrone peaks, which were attributed to cryptomoschatone E3 (S1), cryptomoschatone F1 (S4) and cryptomoschatone E1  (S6), all biosynthesized from cinnamate and five or six acetate units. The more intense peak of styrylpyrones in chemotype FS3 was attributed to cryptomoschatone D1 (S2), produced from cinnamate and four acetate units. The flavonoid glycoside profiles proved to be very similar for all chemotypes, with the peak corresponding to quercetin F6 being the most intense. This regular feature suggests that the relative flavonoid profiles could be used as chemosystematic markers for C. mandioccana.0.0E+00 1.0E+07 2.0E+07 3.0E+07 4.0E+07 5.0E+07 6.0E+07 7.0E+07 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S50.0E+00 5.0E+06 1.0E+07 1.5E+07 2.0E+07 2.5E+07 3.0E+07 3.5E+07 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5Flavonoids and styrylpyrones are biosynthesized by type III polyketide synthases (PKS) (Staunton and Weissman, 2001;Beckert et al., 1997;Jez et al., 2001). Chalcone synthase with a very specific initiation-elongation-cyclization cavity seems to be involved in biosynthesis of flavonoids in leaves of C. mandioccana. However, styrylpyrone synthases showing different elongation cavities must be involved in styrylpyrone biosynthesis and their different expression levels could be related to the  chemotypes described above. Therefore, these C. mandioccana chemotypes could be interesting models for evaluating the relationship between cavity volume and polyketide chain-length in type III PKS, as well as the genetic and environmental influences on their production.F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 S1 NI1 NI2 NI3 NI4 S2 S3 S4 NI5 NI6 NI7 S5 S6 S7 0.0E+00 2.0E+06 4.0E+06 6.0E+06 8.0E+06 1.0E+07 1.2E+07 1.4E+07 1.6E+07 1.Regarding the environmental influences on the C. mandioccana chemical profiles, two aspects must be considered. First, chemotype F was predominant within the SM population, whilst chemotype FS2 was more frequent within the CB and JI populations, demonstrating the inter-and intra-population chemical variability. The rare chemotypes FS1 and FS3 were found only within SM and CB populations, respectively (Fig. 7). The chemical differences observed between northern and southern populations of C. mandioccana could be the first indication of a clinal variation in styrylpyrone contents. In addition, it is known amongst botanists that the floristic composition of these two regions of Atlantic rain forest is quite different, fact that could be explained by the geomorphology and climate of these regions (Leita ˜o Filho, 1982). Second, linear discriminant analysis of the two most frequent C. mandioccana chemotypes (F and FS2), considering  seven soil parameters, time of collection and trunk diameter, revealed that Mg, K and Ca significantly influenced the occurrence of these chemotypes (Table 3). The results using the functions generated by discriminant analysis showed 92.3% of correct classification of trees for chemotype F and 58.8% of correct classification of trees for chemotype FS2, with a total error count of 20.9% (Table 4). In spite of the poor correlation obtained for chemotype FS2 and soil variables, chemotype F possesses good correlation with lower levels of Mg, K and Ca, which suggests some possible influence of soil nutrients on styrylpyrone profiles of C. mandioccana.Chemical variability could be also related to genotype, from two main observations: first, some pairs of trees (i.e., CB253 and CB254, CB230 and CB231, JU2009 and JU2010) that are located just a few meters apart showed different chemical profiles and second, a genetic study on this species has demonstrated that individuals of C. madioccana from different populations form distinct genetic groups closely related to geographical origin and that locus SKdh-2 was significantly related to production of quercetin-3-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (F2) and the diastereoisomers cryptofolione and cryptomoschatone E2 (S6/S7), indicating that shikimate dehydrogenase could play a differential regulation on these chemotypes of C. mandioccana (de Moraes et al., 2007).These facts could be indicative of genetic and/or environmental influence on constitution of styrylpyrones in leaves of C. mandioccana.
