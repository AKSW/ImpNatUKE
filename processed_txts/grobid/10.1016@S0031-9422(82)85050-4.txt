NEOLIGNANS FROM AN ANIBA SPECIES*
The trunk wood of an Amazonian Aniba (Lauraceae) species contains, besides dillapiol and the benzodioxane-type neolignan eusiderin, four bicyclo(3.2.l)octanoid neolignans. These comprise representatives of the canellin-type: the known methoxycanellin-A and the novel compounds characterized as (lR, 3S,

INTRODUCTIONThe trunk wood of a lauraceous tree was collected at Ducke Forest Reserve, Manaus. According to the botanist William A. Rodrigues, the specimen, voucher Herbarium INPA, Manaus, no. 42183, belongs to an unclassified Aniba species. The benzene extract of trunk wood yielded the simple allylbenzene dillapiol (l), the benzodioxane-type neolignan eusiderin (2) [2] and four canellin-type neolignans: methoxycanellin-A (3a) and the novel compounds 4a, 4b and 5a.For reasons stated in a previous paper in this series [3], nomenclature and numbering of neolignans follow the rules outlined in a recent review [2].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSpectral analysis ('H NMR, IR, UV and MS) showed 3a to be a methoxy-derivative of 3b (canellin-A) [4]  Its description, however, lacked definition of the chirality at C-5' [5].The following evidence elucidates this point and indicates 3a and canellin-A (3b) to possess identical absolute configurations.Acetylation of 3a at room temperature led to the monoacetate 3c. The steric 
DIAS et al.hindrance of the hydroxyl at C-2' is best explained by its c&relation with the aryl group, precisely as in the case of canellin-A [2]. The aryl being thus exo-oriented, the benzylic proton (H-7) and the methyl (Me-@ must be endo-oriented.Since the signals of both undergo significant paramagnetic shifts (A respectively 0.44 and 0.09) upon acetylation of OH-4', this hydroxyl must be equally endo-oriented.In consequence H-4' can only be axial. Being represented by a doublet of J = 6.5 Hz it is probably vicinal to another axial proton (H-5') and OMe-5' should be equatorial. Indeed, as would be expected for the OH-4/H-5' cis-relation, acetylation ofOH-4'produces a significant paramagnetic shift (A 0.28) of the H-S' signal. With respect to its relative configuration methoxycanellin-A (3a) is thus identical with canellin-A (3b) [4]. Both compounds also share the absolute configuration since their ORD curves are comparable. and 1 (0.3 g). Eluates 2 (1.2g) and 3 (0.2 g), purified by repeated Si gel TLC (CHQ and CHCIr-EtrO, 49: 1, respectively), yielded 2 (0.6 g) and 3a (50 mg), respectively. Eluate 4 (1.1 g) yielded, by re-crystallizations from MeOH, sitosterol (0.7 g) and by Si gel TLC (C,,H,-Me,CO, 4: 1) of the mother liquor, sitosterol (50 mg) and 3a (0. I g). Eluates 5 (0.3 g) and 6 (0.5 g), purified by repeated Si gel TLC (C6H6-Me,CO, 4: 1 and EtrO, respectively), yielded 4a (0.1 g) and 4b (15 mg), respectively. Eluate 7 (0.5g). by Si gel TLC (CHCl,-EtOH, 9: l), was separated into 5a (20 mg) and polar material. Eluates 8-10 were complex mixtures of polar compounds.
Spectral comparison('H NMR including consideration of all relevant decouplings at 270 MHz, IR, UV and MS) indicated 4a to differ from 3a solely by the presence of an oxo-group (instead of a hydroxyl) on the five-membered ring (IR v,,,,~ 1757 cm-') and of an exo-hydroxyl (instead of an endo-orientated one) at C-4'. Indeed H-8 and the aromatic protons resonated at higher field in 4a (T respectively ca 8.2 and 3.7), where they are shielded by the C-2' carbonyl, than in 3s (7 respectively ca 7.6 and 3.4). Furthermore H-4' showed two small couplings (J = 2 and < 0.5 Hz), due to equatorial-axial and equatorialequatorial (W) relationships, respectively, with H-5' and one H-6', in 4a; against one relatively large coupling (J = 6.5 Hz), due to the axial-axial relationship with H-5', in 3a. As was expected, in contrast to the situation prevailing in 3a (OMe-3', r 6.80), in 4a OH-4 on one hand does not affect paramagnetically the signals of H-7, Me-8 and H-5' upon acetylation, and on the other hand affects sterically the now cisrelated OMe-3' forcing it towards the shielding region of the aromatic ring (OMe-3', T 7.18) (Table 1).Identification of dillapiol (1) [4]  Compounds 4a and 4b differ only with respect to the substituents of the aromatic ring: the methylenedioxy group of 4a is replaced by two methoxyls in 4b (Table 1).The constitution of 5a was assigned on the basis of spectral comparisons with 5b, a known canellin-type neolignan [6]. The spectral differences can be rationalized by analogy with the pair 4a/3a, i.e. again OH-4' occupies either an exo-(in 5a, OMe-3', r 7.17) or an endo-(in 5b, OMe-3', T 6.67) position (Table 1). With respect to its relative configuration 5a is thus identical to 5c, a neolignan of known absolute configuration [7]. The ORD curves of both compounds being similar, 5a and 5c also share the absolute configuration shown in the formulae.
