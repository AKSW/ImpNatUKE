An Unprecedented Neolignan Skeleton from Chimarrhis turbinata
b S Supporting InformationAs part of our research project focusing on the phytochemical investigation of new biologically active compounds from Amazonian plant species, the constituents of the leaves and barks from Chimarrhis turbinata DC Prodr. (Rubiaceae) have been examined. [1][2][3][4][5] Previous phytochemical studies of C. turbinata established the presence of indole alkaloids with weak anticholinesterase activity 2 as well as several phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties. 3,5 Herein, the isolation, structural elucidation, and conformational analysis of a new C 6 .C 3 lignan skeleton type (1) are reported.We have previously described the isolation of the two known phenolic compounds 2 and 3. 4,6 Herein, their antioxidant properties along with those of compound 1 are reported and compared with those of the commercially available antioxidant BHT. Evaluation of the parameters related to the antioxidant activity was accomplished by measuring the free radical scavenging ability of the compounds toward DPPH. 7 The liquid-liquid partitioning of the EtOH extract of air-dried leaves of C. turbinata, followed by a sequence of size exclusion chromatography of the EtOAc-soluble fraction on Sephadex LH-20 and further purification using C18 HPLC, eluted with a CH 3  ABSTRACT: A lignan with a new skeleton named chimarrhinin (1) was isolated from an extract of the leaves of Chimarrhis turbinata, a Rubiaceae plant species. 13 C NMR spectrometric techniques including 1D and 2D experiments and HRESIMS provided unequivocal structural confirmation of this new C 6 .C 3 skeleton type. The relative configuration of 1 was established by 2D 1 H-H analysis and J couplings, while its conformation was evaluated through molecular modeling using the RM1 semiempirical method, with the aid of coupling constants obtained by NMR analysis. The antioxidant activity of the new derivative 1 and two known and previously isolated phenolic derivatives (2 and 3) was investigated. An IC 50 value of 7.50 ( 0.5 μmol L -1 was obtained for the new derivative 1, while 2 and 3 showed IC 50 values of 18.60 ( 0.4 and 18.50 ( 0.6 μmol, respectively. 117. 7, 151.3, 115.7, 151.3, and 117.7 evidenced the presence of one 1,3,5-substituted aromatic ring. 9 The signals at δ C 63.3, 70.2, 71.2, and 81.5 were assigned to a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran moiety. The signal at δ C 91.7 revealed a peculiar downfield shifted carbon, which, analyzed together with the signals at δ C 28.5, 41.3, 43.2, and 173.6, allowed us to attribute one part of the structure of 1 as being a trisubstituted lactone moiety (Table 1).Detailed analysis of the 1 H-1 H COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra demonstrated that 1 bears a different skeleton, with two C 6 .C 3 units similar to those found in lignoids. Correlations between H-7 (2H, δ 3.06, d, J = 13.0; 17.5 Hz), H-8 (δ 4.22, dd, J = 13.0; 9.0 Hz), H-9 0 (2H, δ 2.70 and 2.75, J = 8.5 Hz), and H-8 0 (δ 3.33, m) were observed by 1 H-1 H COSY. The hydrogen at δ 3.06 (H-7) has HMBC correlations with the aromatic carbon at δ 125.6 (C-1) and with a quaternary carbon at δ 176.5 (C-9), as well as a correlation with a methine carbon at δ 43.2 (C-8). Correlations of the methylene hydrogen resonating at δ 3.33 (H-8 0 ) with C-1 0 and C-9 0 and correlations of H 2 -9 0 with C-8 0 and C-7 0 are also evident. The hydrogen at δ 4.66 (H-2b) correlates with C-7 0 and C-3b. From these observations and the analysis of all 1 H and 13 C NMR data (Table 1), it is evident that the two caffeic acid units and a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran system are connected to the δ-lactone moiety.These data suggest the presence of a δ-lactone moiety linked at C-1 0 (ring C) and at C-2b (ring B), Figure 2. The anisotropic unshielded signals of the quaternary carbon C-7 (δ 91.7) might be explained by its ligands: oxygen, the aromatic carbon C-1 0 , and C-2b. The correlations between H-2b (δ 4.66, d, J = 8.5 Hz), H-3b (δ 3.68, dd, J = 2.5; 8.5 Hz), H 2 -4b (δ 3.57, ddd, J = 2.5; 6.0; 6.5 Hz and δ 3.41, dd, J = 6.5; 11.0 Hz), and H 2 -5b (δ 3.32, m) indicate that ring B consists of a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran system, biogenetically derived from a tetrose sugar unit (Figure 2). HMBC correlations from the aromatic hydrogens at δ 7.33 (H-2a) and 7.31 (H-6a) of the third 1,3,5-trisubstituted aromatic ring (A) with C-7a (δ 176.5) showed that the third aromatic system is the 3,5-dihydroxylbenzoic ester moiety at C-3 of the tetrose ring (B) (Figure 2).These observations and the presence of two caffeic acid moieties, which could be biogenetically defined as a neolignan, determined a skeleton formed by unusual couplings C-7-C-9 0 and HOC-9-C8 0 . The spectroscopic evidence and a literature survey of lignan types (neolignans and lignans) indicated that compound 1 has a new neolignan-type skeleton.The relative configuration of the sterocenters at C-2b, C-3b, C4-b, C-7 0 , and C-8 and the conformation of 1 were determined on the basis of coupling constants and conformational analysis by the semiempirical RM1 method in the gas phase. For C-2b and C-3b, the coupling constants of H-2b (δ 4.66 d, J = 8.5 Hz) and H-3b (δ 3.68 dd, J = 8.5, 2.5 Hz) indicate a vicinal H-2b ax -H-3b ax position, which is in good agreement with the presence of the gallate moiety in the β-position at C-3b. For C-4b, the coupling constants of H-4b (δ 3.56 ddd, J = 6.5, 6.75, 2.5 Hz) also confirm an R-hydroxy group at this position. The 1 H NMR data recorded in methanol-d 4 clearly show all the coupling constants of H-4b with H ax and H eq -5b (Table 1) and confirmed the tetrose moiety as part of this molecule. The coupling constants of H-8 (δ 4.22 dddbr, J = 9.0, 13.0 Hz) suggest the R-positioned 8-R, which is in accordance with the relative configuration of C-8. The relative configuration is assigned as 2R*, 3R*, 4S*, 7 0 S*, and 8R*.To confirm the relative configuration of C-2b, C-3b, C-4b, and C-8 and in order to establish the conformation of 1, this structure was submitted to conformational analysis by the semiempirical RM1 method in the gas phase. The obtained minimum energy conformations enable estimation of 3 J HH coupling constants by means of the Haasnoot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation, 10 which considers the electronegativity of the substituents and the geometry of the H-C-C-H dihedral angle. A comparison between the theoretical and experimental coupling constants permitted the characterization of the conformation of chimarrhinin, represented in Figure 3, with the respective theoretical coupling constants (Table 1), considering the most stable envelope conformation of the tetrahydrofuran ring and half-chair conformation of the tetrahydro-2-pyranone ring. Consistent with previous conformational analyses of natural products with diverse skeletons, 1,11,12 the employed semiempirical calculations agreed with experimental data more satisfactorily when compared with older Hamiltonians such as AM1 and PM3 and ab initio HF/6-31G** calculations.The radical scavenging effects observed for compounds 1-3 assayed with DPPH are summarized in Table 2, the standard antioxidant BHT (IC 50 62.50 ( 0.6 μmol L -1 ), and chlorogenic acid (IC 50 20.0 ( 0.2 μmol L -1 ) used as reference. The results indicate that the free radical scavenging activity of these molecules is due to their hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the stabilization of the phenoxy radical after DPPH reduction. Stabilization is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and, in the case of the phenylpropanoids (2, 3), the R,βunsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by their IC 50 values. Compound 1 gave the best results, with an IC 50 value lower than that of the standard BHT, a well-known food antioxidant. This result may be related to the presence of two catechol groups in this molecule.' EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotation measurements were conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter using a quartz cuvette (length 1 cm). IR spectra were measured on either a Perkin-Elmer 1600 or a Nicolet EMACT-40 FTIR spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 NMR spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1 H and at 125 MHz for 13 C. TMS was used as internal standard. Mass spectra were obtained at high resolution on a Micromass Q-TOF spectrometer. For chromatographic procedures, Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) was employed. Preparative HPLC separations were performed on a Varian Prep LC 4000 System, and C18 Luna (Phenomenex) columns and precolumns were utilized. Fractions A-8 to A-12 yielded the compounds described elsewhere. 3,4 Fraction A-6,7 (0.699 g) was purified by gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20 CC (88.0 cm Â 2.0 cm), which was eluted with MeOH, giving 36     CN/ H 2 O (18:88 v/v) isocratic elution using a Phenomenex Luna column (25.0 mm Â 21.20 mm Â 5 μm) at a flow rate of 10 mL min -1 and UV detection at 280 nm, afforded compound 1. Compound 1 was obtained as an amorphous, pale brown powder, [R] D 25 -204 (c 0.01, MeOH), which was analyzed for C 29 H 28 O 12 by a combination of HRESIMS and 13 C NMR data. The molecular formula of 1 was determined from the [M -H 2 O] þ peak at m/z 550.6433 (calcd for C 29 H 26 O 11 550.1475). The IR spectrum with absorption bands at 3403, 1705, 1657, and 1627 cm -1 suggested the presence of phenolic and carboxylic groups. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) displayed signals for nine aromatic hydrogens, which indicates the presence of three aromatic ring systems with different substitution patterns. The signals at δ 7.31 (d, J = 2.0 Hz), 7.33 (ddbr, J = 2.0; 2.0 Hz), and 7.23 (s) corresponded to the aromatic hydrogens of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted ring. Additionally, the signals at δ 6.78 (d, J = 2.0 Hz), 6.69 (d, J = 8.0 Hz), 6.61 (J = 8.0 Hz), 6.67 (dd, J = 8.0; 2.0 Hz), 6.55 (sbr), and 7.32 (d, br, J = 8.0 Hz) were attributed to six aromatic hydrogens from 1,3,4trisubstituted rings. These 1 H NMR data clearly confirm the presence of three distinct aromatic moieties in 1. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 1 showed signals for 29 different carbons: 11 quaternary (sp 2 ), two of which are carbonyls (δ 176.5, C-9; 173.6, C-7a), one quaternary (sp 3 ); nine sp 2 methines; four sp 3 methines, three of which are oxymethine; and four methylenes, one of which is a sp 3 methines. The signals at δ C 146.0, 146.5, 116.8, 115.7, 123.8, 146.7, 146.0, 115.2, 116.5, and 121.7 were ascribed to two 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic systems characteristic of a catechol moiety. 8 The signals at δ C Special Issue: Special Issue in Honor of Koji Nakanishi Received: October 16, 2010
