INTRODUCTIONThe nomadic and very primitive Maku Indians of the Apaporis basin (Amazonia) employ a plaster made of the crushed leaves of Iryanthera polyneuru Ducke (Myristicaceae) for treating seriously infected wounds and cuts [3]. This ethnopharmacological observation stimulated interest in the chemistry of the tree, and a study on the composition of its trunk wood was undertaken. The results are reported in the present paper.
RESULTS
Fractionationof a benzene extract of the trunk wood afforded, besides sitosterol and pinocembrin, the 1,3diarylpropane la, previously obtained from I. coriacea Ducke [S], two novel compounds, the additional diarylpropane lc and the dihydrochalcone 2a, and a small quantity ofa mixture containing two chalcones tentatively formulated 3a and 3b.The basic structure of the diarylpropane, C,,H 0-Me(OH),OMe.O.,CH,, was indicated by 'H and "C NMR spectral evidence which pointed to a CH,. CH, . CH, chain flanked by two aryl groups. One must bear 2-methoxy-4,5-methylened~oxy substitutions.The base peak in the MS shows the correct mass for a methoxymethylenedioxytropylium ion; the 'H NMR spectrum includes two singlets (6 3.34 and 3.42). The other aryl group bears 2,4-dihydroxy-3-methyl substitution. The 'H NMR spectrum includes two doublets (6 6.36 and 6.72, J = 8 Hz); oxidation of the compound does not lead to ortho or para-quinones; a 13C NMR quartet at high field (6 8.9)is compatible only with a methyl between two vicinal substituents    [S].

la R' zz RL = R3 = R4 =i H lb R1 = R* = R4 = H, R3 = Me lc R' = R3 = H, R2 = Me, R4 = OMe ld RL = R3 = OAc, RZ = Me, R4 = OMe (2~) are compatible with the analogous data for la [4] and virolane (lb) (see Experimental), previously obtained from Virola multineroia Ducke [6]. The basic structure of the dihydrochalcone, C,,H,,O-(OH),OMe, was indicated by "H and 13C NMR spectral evidence which pointed to a CH, . CH, group flanked by benzoyl and aryl substituents. The benzoyl group must be 2,4-dihydroxylated: the molecule has chelated and acidic hydroxyls evidenced by IR :lnd UV (AlCl, and NaOAc shifts) spectra; acetylation produces NMR shifts of the aromatic C signals which are closely comparable with the values observed for 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone (see Experimental). The aryl group must bear 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy substitution: the two oxy-functions are located at C-3 and C-4 (H-2, H-S and H-6 give a NMR multiplet at 6 6.7-6.9); acetylation produces paramagnetic shifts
(f5.1 to +7.6 ppm) of the C-l, C-3 and C-5 signals, and a small diamagnetic shift (-2.1 ppm) of the C-4 signal, leaving the C-2 and C-6 signals practically unaffected. The MS of this dihydrochalcone (Za) is accordingly very simple, since both the dihydroxybenzoyl ion and the hydroxy-methoxytro~ylium ion have mje 137. The constituents of a mixture obtained in minute amount were tentatively characterized as chalcones 3a and 3b by 'H NMR spectroscopy. Not only the molecular peaks 286 (55%) and 300 (45%) of the MS, but also the fragment peaks due to dihydroxybe~zoyl (m/e 137 (100 "/,)), hydroxy-methoxystyryl (m/e 150 (80%)) and dimethoxystyryl (m/e 164 (50%)) ions, were consistent with this hypothesis. DISCUSSION The biosynthesis of cinnamylphenols in Leguminosae was postulated to involve the cinnamylation of triacetate moieties [7]. The fact that both the Leguminosae and the Myristicaceae are isoflavonoid accumulators invites the hypothesis that, as a further common biochemical feature, cinnamylation also occurs in both families, the 1,3-diarylpropanes of Myristicaceae being simply hydrogenation products of intermediate cinnamylphenols. It has, nevertheless, been suggested recently that the co-occurrence of I,3-diaryipropanes with I,3-diarylpropan-2-01s and flavans points to their biosynthetic derivation from chalcones [8), a postulate which receives now additionai support by the isolation of a ~avanone and, most importantly, by the co-occurrence of chalcone-dihydrochaIcon~-1,3-diarylpropane with identical oxygenation pattern in Ir~J~ntizgra ~ol~neuru. EXPERIMENTAL Isolation of the constituents. Trunk wood of Iryanthera polyneura was collected near Manaus, Amazonas State, and identified by the botanist Dr. William A. Rodrigues.

The aromatic fraction (25g) was rechrumatographed on a Si gel column.
