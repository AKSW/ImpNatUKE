ANTHRAQUINONES FROM WSMIA SPECIES*
Abatrati-1,8-Dihydroxy-3-methyl-6-methoxyanthraquinone (physcion) and two derivatives, 7-@runs-3-methyl-lbutenyl)-physcion (vismiaquinone) and 7-(3-methyl-2-oxobutyl)-physcion (vismiaquinone B), were isolated respectively from Vismia cayennensis and V. japurensis.Vismia cuyennensis (Jacq.) Pers. [1] and V. .japurensis Reich. (Guttiferae) [2] are large shrubs which occur in north-eastern South America. The latter species has recently been located also in central Brazil (Prof. Jose Badini, private information). Wood samples were found to contain respectively physcion (la), besides sitosterol, lupeol and betulinic acid, and the two physcion derivatives lb and lc, besides sitosterol, friedelin and friedelan-3/?-01.The structures of lb and lc resulted from a comparison of their spectral data with those of physcion (la) [3] Physcion (la) is a well known natural compound and has been isolated for instance from Harunganu madagascariensis Poir. which also belongs to the Guttiferae family [4]. 7-(3-Methyl-1-butenyl)-physcion (lb) has been reported previously as one of the alkaline decomposition products of vismione A, a constituent of the berries of Vismia baccjfera (L.) Tr. et Pl. subsp. dealbata (H.B.K.) Ewan [S]. Gon@ves and Mors [6], who isolated lb while our work on V. japurensis was in progress and who named the compound vismiaquinone, demonstrated, however, that the product is a genuine constituent of the leaves of V. reichardtiana (0. Ktze.) Ewan.In addition to vismione A and vismiaquinone, only the flavones artocarpin, norartocarpin [7] and chaplashine [8] from Artocurpus (Moraceae) species have been reported to contain 3-methyl-1-butenyl side chains. Delle Monache et al. [5] postulated that these groups may be formed from the more usual y,y-dimethylallyl chains by shift of the double bond into conjugation with the aromatic nucleus. The isolation of the novel vismiaquinone B (lc) reveals a possible mechanism for this shift. 
EXPERIM]~ITALIsolation of the constituents of Vismia cayennensis. Plant material was collected near km 63 of the Manans-Itacoatiara road (Amazonas State) and identitied by Dr. William A. Rodrigues, INPA, Manaus. Air-dried, powdered bark (700 g) was extracted with C6H ~. The extract (62 g) was chromatographed on Si gel (300g). Elution (50ml fractions) was performed with CtH ~ (fractions 1-6), CtHt-CHC13 mixtures (fractions 7-21), CHCI 3 (fractions 22-41) and CHC13-MeOH 5:1 (fractions 42-73). The initial fractions contained fatty material. Fractions 33-41, 42-49 and 50-65 were evapd and the residues purified, by rcchromatography and crystallization from the indicated solvents, to give respectively la (20 rag, EtOH-CHCI3),/~-amyrin (20rag, EtOH) and sitosterol (40rag, MeOH). Air-dried, powdered wood (5 kg) was extracted with EtOH. The extract (10g) was chromatographed on Si gel (100g). Elution (50ml fraction) was performed with solvents of increasing polarity. Fractions 21-50 gave betulinie acid.Isolation of the constituents of Vistula japurcnsis. Plant material was collected at Serra do Carac, a near Ouro Preto (Minas Gerais State) and identified by Prof. J. Badini, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (voucher Herbarium, Escola de Minas de Ouro Preto No. 1379). Air-dried, ground wood (3.4 kg) was extracted with C6H 6. The extract (25 g) was chromatographed on Si gel (150 g). Elution (25 ml fractions) was performed with C6H 6 (fractions 1-49), C6H~-CHC13 1:2 (fractions 141-189) and CHCI 3 (fractions 191-205). The initial fractions contained fatty material. Fractions 9-14, 31-37 and 38-49 were evapd and the residue purified, by rechromatography and crystallization from the indicated solvents, to give respectively lb (30rag, EtOH--CHC13, 19:1), friedelin (25rag, EtOH) and fricdelan-3/]-ol (20rag, subl.). Fractions 141-189 were evapd. The residue was crystallized from MeOH to give sitosterol (40rag  7.63 (dq, J = 1.5, 0.5 Hz, H-4), 7.42 (s. H-5), 7.08 (dq, J = 1.5, 1.0Hz, H-2), 3.98 (s, OMe-6), 3.90 (s, CH2-7), 2.79 (septet, J = 7 Hz, CI~Me2), 2.45 (s (br), vl/2 = 2 Hz, Me-3), 1.19 (d, J = 7Hz, 2Me).. The 'HNMR spectra were very similar with respect to the signals of H-5 (6 7.38 + 0.04), H-4 (6 7.59 + 0.04), H-2 (6 7.05 + 0.03), Me-3 (6 2.43 f 0.02), OMe-6 (6 3.98 * 0.02) and two chelated hydroxyls. The only significant differences were that the signal of H-7 (6 6.68) in la, was replaced by signals assigned to a trans-3-methyl-lbutenyl group in lb and a 3-methyl-2-oxobutyl group in lc. All assignments and, most importantly, the fact that the C-Me group is flanked by two aromatic protons, were confirmed by double irradiation experiments. The IR spectra were consistent with the proposed structures indicating the existence in all three compounds ofchelated cv::; 1623 + 2cn-') and unchelated (Y"A 1666 *Part 38 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Guttiferae".

Oxygenation of the b-carbon of y,y-dimethylallyl groups does occur in Guttiferae, as demonstrated by psorospermin (2) [9], and an analogous intermediate substituted by -CH,.CHOR.CHMe, may be a common lb and le.
