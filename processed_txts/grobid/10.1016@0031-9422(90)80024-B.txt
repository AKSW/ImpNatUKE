MObLUSCICIDAL QUINOLINE ALKALOIDS FROM GALIPEA BRACTEATA
Four quinoline alkaloids were isolated from stems of Gnlipea bracteata. In addition to one new compound, 2-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenylethyl)-quinoline, three were identified as the known compounds 2+propylquinoline, 2n-pentylquinoline and 2-(l'-pentenyl)-quinoline. However, this is the first report of their isolation from a natural source. All alkaloids showed an inhibitory effect on shoot and root growth of lettuce (Lactuca satiua). Three of them also showed molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, involved in the transmission of schistosomiasis.

INTRODUCTIONThe Rutaceae is represented by a great number of species in tropical areas. Many of these species have never been the target of a phytochemical investigation.In our continuing effort to find biologically active compounds we have investigated
G&pea bracteata.In this paper we report the isolation and identification of one new alkaloid and three known ones from G. bracteata collected in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The growth inhibitory effect against lettuce of the alkaloids, as well as, their molluscicidal activity are also described.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe dichloromethane extract of the stems of G. bracteata afforded four alkaloids 14.   J(Hz): Compounds I-4: 3,4=8.5; 5,6=6,7=7,8==7.8; 5,7=6, 8 = 1.2: compounds 1, 2: 1',2'=7.4; compound 3: 1',2'= 16.0; compounds l-3: 2',3'= 7.4; compounds 2, 3: 3',4'=4'.5' = 7.2; compound 4: 4'6' = 1.2; 7',8' = 7.8 = 7.8, 1.2 Hz), as well as by the presence of a methylenedioxy ring assigned to the signal at 6 5.90 integrating for two protons. The presence of a piperonyl moiety is once more confirmed by the mass spectrum which showed a peak at m/z 135. The parent peak of m/z 217 requires a methylenedioxyphenylethyl as the substituent of this quinoline. The complete assignment of chemical shifts for all carbons are given in Table 2. The compounds 2methyl (5) and 2-aminoquinoline (6) were used as models c121.The alkaloids isolated showed inhibitory effects on the growth of lettuce seedlings and molluscicidal activity as determined according to the methods described pre-viously [3,4]. All compounds at concentrations larger than 500ppm inhibited both shoot and root growth in the lettuce test. At lower concentrations their activities were diminished.When the concentration was decreased to 100 ppm, only compounds 3 and 4 showed activity but at this concentration.1 and 2 had no activity. Molluscicidal activity was exhibited by compounds 2-4. Compound 1 was not molluscicidal even at 100 ppm. Compound 4 had the most powerful molluscicidal activity killing snails at a concentration of only 5 ppm. Compounds 2 and 3 possessed activities at 20 and 10 ppm, respectively.Our results suggest that the presence of a second aromatic ring at C-2 increases the activity of the compounds, and that the activity of 2-alkylquinolines depends on the length of the alkyl chain. It is important to note that very few examples of naturally occurring alkaloids have been found to exhibit molluscicidal activity [S]. although recently, some potent molluscicidal alkaloids were isolated from members of the Meliaceae [S]. It is also important to mention that few species of the genus Gu/ipeu have been studied. However, in a unique example presented by Mester [7], the alkaloids isolated were 7substituted quinolines. We suspect that there should be a tendency for this genus to produce this class of compound.  
EXPERIMENTAL= 7.4 Hz), 60.91 (t), integrating 2: 2: 3, respectively. Confirmation of this unit can be taken from the 13CNMR signals at 641.30,23.25 and 13.99, which can be attributed to C-l', C-2' and C-3', respectively.Compounds 2 and 3 are very closely related to each other and to compound 1. The mass spectra showed the parent peak at m/z 199 and 197 for 2 and 3 respectively, indicating that the difference between 2 and 3 is two hydrogen atoms. Analysis of the 'H NMR of both compounds showed that 2 has two more signals in the olefinic region C66.80 (td) and 66.70 (d)] than 3 and revealed the presence of a trans-substituted double bond in 3. The signal of four aliphatic protons at 61.30 (m) for 2 was observed, which corresponds to two methylene carbons. The 13CNMR for compounds 2 and 3 showed 14 signals. For 2 there were five signals at high field indicating a n-pentyl moiety. However, for 3 there were only three signals in this region. These data indicate that 2 has a n-pentyl chain attached to C-2 and that 3 has the corresponding pentenyl chain. Compound 4 is related to the three compounds described above. Analysis of its 'H and 13CNMR spectra reveals that, in addition to the quinoline ring, there is another aromatic ring present in the molecule. The trisubstituted nature of this ring is confirmed by the signals 66.72 (d, 5=1.2 Hz), 66.69 (d, J=7.8 Hz), 66.65 (dd, J 1 R=\;f\ 3 Table
Isolation of constituents. Galipea hracteata was collected inMinas Gerais, Brazil; a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of Institute de Biociencias. USP, Sao Paulo. Dried stems (920 g) were extd with CH,CI, at room temp. for 4 days. The ext was evapd to dryness yielding (5.567 g) ofcrude extract. A portion of this ext (1.463 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (50 g) and eluted with solvents of increasing polarity (CH,CI,, EtOAc and MeOH). Alkaloids were found in frs 16.-35. They were then sepd by low pressure chromatography on silica gel (Lichroprep) using hexane-EtOAc (49: l), affording I (31 mg), 2 (IOmg). 3 (15 mg) and 4 (I 13 mg).
