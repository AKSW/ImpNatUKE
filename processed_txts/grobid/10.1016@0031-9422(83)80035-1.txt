THREE ENT-KAURENE DITERPENES FROM VELLOZZA CAPUT-ARDEAE
Three new ent-kaurene diterpenes have been isolated from the roots and stem of Vellozia caput-ardeae. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods as ent-9/3-hydroxy kaur-16-ene, ent-1 lu-hydroxy kaur-16ene and ent-9/?,lla-dihydroxy kaur-16-ene.

INTRODUCTIONIn previous papers [l, 21 we described two kaurene diterpenes and one seco-kaurene from Vellozia caputardeae. In the present communication we report the isolation and structural determination of three hydroxylated kaurenes from the same species.
RESULTS
ANDDISCUSSIONThe molecular formulae of the isomeric alcohols la and 2a (C,,H,,O) and the diol 3a (C20H3202) were determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The 'H NMR spectra of each of the three compounds contained resonances assigned to three tertiary methyl groups and an exocyclic methylene which suggested that they were tetracyclic diterpenes, probably of the kaurene class. la R=H, uOH lb R=H, aOAc1~ R=O 2a i ' fl k\ '. 2b 3a R=H, OOH 3b R =H, aOAc 3C R=OThe oxygen-containing functional group of la was shown to be a secondary hydroxyl group by IR (vki;crn-': 3450 and 1060) and by the presence of a triple doublet at 6 4.28 (lH, J = 10,8 and 8 Hz)in the 'H NMR spectrum. This signal was shifted downfield to 6 5.37 upon acetylation of la to lb. The multiplicity of this signal (ddd) indicated the vicinity of methine and methylene units. This limited the possible positions for the hydroxyl group to C-6 or C-11. The C-6 position was eliminated by analysis of the 13C NMR spectra (Table 1). In the spectrum for kaurene, the triplets for C-2, C-6 and C-l 1 are found near 6 20 while the triplets for C-7 and C-12 appear near 6 40 and 30, respectively[3].As the "C NMR spectrum of la exhibited only two triplets near 6 20 and absence of a triplet near 30, it was clear that C-l 1 was oxygenated. This was further corroborated by the spectroscopic properties of the ketone lc derived from la. The 13C NMR signals for C-9 and C-12 showed the expected downfield shifts (Table 1) for lc compared to la. Compound la was, thus, identified as ent-llahydroxykaur-16-ene.Compound 2a was found to be a tertiary alcohol: IR v,a,cm-l: 3500; 13C NMR singlet at 677.6, and the absence in the 'H NMR spectrum of signals which could be assigned to a carbinolic proton.Further evidence for the location of the hydroxyl group at C-9 was the dehydration product 2b of 2a, whose 'H NMR spectrum exhibited a triplet at 6 5. This data also confirmed the stereochemistry assigned to 2a. Compound 2a was, therefore, identified as ent-9,G'-hydroxy-kaur-16ene.The 'H NMR spectrum of compound 3a showed two signals at 6 1.62 and 2.10 (both exchangeable with D20). This data determined that 3a was a diol. One of the hydroxyl groups was secondary, as shown by a double doublet at 6 3.96 (lH, J = 10 and 8 Hz) which moved downfield to 4.94 upon acetylation of 3a to 3b. presence of a tertiary hydroxyl group was confirmed by the 'H NMR spectra of 3b and the ketone 3c, obtained from 3a by oxidation. The position of the tertiary hydroxyl group was determined to be at C-9, from the 13C NMR chemical shifts of C-l, C-5, C-7 and C-15 in comparison with the spectrum of 2a.The multiplicity of the signal assigned to the carbinolic proton, a double doublet, limited the location of the secondary hydroxyl group to C-l, C-7 or C-l 1. Positions C-l and C-7 were eliminated by analysis of the "C NMR spectra of compounds 3a-3c. As regards the stereochemistry of two substances, la and 3a, the magnitude of the coupling constants for the carbinolic proton at C-11 in these substances and their derivatives (lb and 3b) made it obvious that this hydroxyl group was equatorial. Compound 3a was. thus, shown to be ent-9p,l la-dihydroxy-kaur-16-ene. 14 (lH, J = 4 Hz) [4]. Comparison of the 13C NMR spectra of 2a and kaurene [3] confirmed the above deductions. The C-9 hydroxyl group in 2a caused an up-field shift in the resonances assigned to C-l, C-5, C-7 and C-15 through the strong y-effects within the cyclic system[5,6]. The chemical shift of C-20, as expected, was unaltered in comparison to the model compound.
