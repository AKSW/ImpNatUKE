Evaluation of Effect of Triterpenes and Limonoids on Cell Growth, Cell Cycle and Apoptosis in Human Tumor Cell Lines
Six triterpenes and eight limonoids were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit the growth of three human tumour cell lines, breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5). The mechanisms involved in the observed cell growth arrest of the four most potent compounds were carried out by studying their effect in cell cycle profile and programmed cell death. The results showed that one triterpene (odoratol) and two limonoids (gedunin and cedrelone) caused cell cycle arrest while only the limonoids gedunin and cedrelone were found to be very potent inducers of apoptosis.

INTRODUCTIONCancer represents one of the most severe health problems worldwide and the development of new anticancer drugs and more effective treatment strategies are fields of utmost importance in drug discovery and clinical therapy. Based on significant advances in cancer biology, much of the research in these areas is currently focused on cancer-specific mechanisms and the corresponding molecular targets [1].Natural products have been the major sources of chemical diversity driving pharmaceutical discovery over the past century. Many natural products and synthetically modified natural product derivatives have been successfully developed for clinical use to treat human diseases in almost all therapeutic areas [2]. In fact, plant-derived compounds have played an important role in treatment of cancers, and some of the most promising and effective drugs have come up from plant sources like taxol ® , camptothecin, combrestatin, vinblastine and vincristine. These drugs have also been the major source of new drug candidates for cancer chemotherapy [3]. Apart from these, many other plant-derived compounds are now in clinical trials as anticancer agents.One of the most interesting groups of plant natural products is the triterpenoid group. Over the past decade, coming to the foreground of interest due to their diverse biological effects are a large group of cyclic triterpenoid-like substances which comprise more than 4000 different identified compounds so far. Triterpenoids are studied for their anti-inflammatory activity, hepatoprotective, analgesic, antimicrobial, antimicotic, virostatic, immunomodulatory and tonic effects. They are used in prevention and treatment of hepatitis, parasitic and protozoal infection and above all, for their cytotoxic effects [4].From a biological point of view, most important triterpenoid structures are oleanane, ursane, lupane and dammarane triterpenoids. However, in what concerns the anticancer effects, not many triterpenoid compounds have been so far studied. Among these, the lupane triterpene betulinic acid and the ursane triterpenes boswellic acid and ursolic acid have been exhaustively studied for their anticancer effects.Betulinic acid, which belongs to the lupane group, has been investigated intensively for its anticancer activity. Betulinic acid was found to exhibit the cytotoxic effects against human melanoma cell lines MEL-1, 2 and 4 having the IC 50 ranging from 0.5-1.6 g/ml and dose dependent fragmentation of DNA with induction of apoptosis occurred 24 hours after administration [5]. Cytotoxic effects of betulinic acid were also found in other cell lines including ovarian A2780, OVCAR-5, GROV-1, large cell lung cancer NCI-H460, epidermoid carcinoma A431, melanoma Me665/2/21, Me665/ 2/60, small cell lung cancer POGB and POGB/DX (doxorubicin resistant) with the IC 50 values ranging from 1.5-4.5 g/ml. However, it showed lower toxicity to non-tumor cell lines such as HDFC (normal dermal fibroblasts, IC 50 = 10.2 ± 1.5 g/ml) and PBL (peripheral blood lymphocytes, IC 50 = 50 g/ml), in comparison with doxorubicin (HDFC, IC 50 = 0.38 g/ml; PBL, IC 50 =0.02 g/ml). Interestingly, betulinic acid was markedly more effective than cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristin and radiation on the primary cancer cells isolated from glioblastoma multiforme [6]. It was demonstrated also that one of the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of betulinic acid and its derivatives was apoptosis induction which was mediated by increasing permeability of the mitochondrial membrane which disturbs the transmembrane potential, causing the release of cytochrome-c and AIF (apoptosis inducing factor), with the resulting activation of caspases 3 and 8. Subsequent cleavage of the substrates and nuclear fragmentation thus occurred [7]. Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeability by enhanced expression of Bcl-2 or BcL-xL proteins suppresses activation of caspases and other markers of apoptosis of neuroectodermal origin [8]. Furthermore, betulinic acid was found to exert its cytotoxic effect against human glioma cell lines (LN-229, U87, MG, T98G, LN-18 and LN-308) and an increased level of the proapoptotic protein Bax was observed 24 hours after treatment with betulinic acid. The induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are essential for activation of caspase 3, also occurred [9]. On the other hand, clones of these cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl-2, showed reduced ROS without activation of betulinic acid induced apoptosis. These findings were in accordance with the fact that the antiapoptotic properties of Bcl-2 are connected with antioxidative defence mechanisms. This underlines the importance of producing ROS in the induction of apoptosis by betulinic acid. Betulinic acid is also an inhibitor of the enzyme aminopeptidase N which takes part in the angioproliferative and metastatic activity of tumors. From a clinical perspective, it is interesting to point out that betulinic acid exhibits its greater effect in an environment with a pH lower than 6.8, which is the case for the majority of tumors [10]. Tellingly, in contrast to noncancer cells, cancer cells subjected to hypothermia showed increased sensitivity to betulinic acid [11].For the ursane group, boswellic acid and its derivatives were found to be cytotoxic to glioma cell lines [12]. In animal model, depending on dose, they caused an increased passage of cells to apoptosis, inhibition of tumor growth and extension of survival after implantation of cell lines of malignant glioma C6 [13]. Derivatives of boswellic acid were found to induce differentiation in leukemic cell lines in low concentrations and in high concentrations they led to apoptosis [14]. The antiproliferative effects of these derivatives are connected to their ability to inhibit both topoisomerase I and II , whose activity is critical for the proliferation of cancer cells. Acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (AKBA), originally isolated from Boswellia serrata, was found to inhibit constitutive STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription-3) in human multiple myeloma cells [15]. Activation of STAT3 has been linked with survival, proliferation, chemoresistance and angiogenesis of tumor cells, including human multiple myeloma. Thus, agents that can suppress STAT3 activation have potential as cancer therapeutics. Lipophilicity of boswellic acid derivatives allows them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and thus renders them the potential for use in the treatment of malignancies of the CNS. Concerning this, they were found to show higher inhibitory effects against glioma cells than those of the clinically used anticancer agents camptothecins [16] and etoposide [12]. Furthermore, derivatives of boswellic acid are shown to be suitable for palliative treatment of progressive or relapsing brain tumors, due to, among other things, their anti-edematous properties [17]. Another interesting member of the ursane group is ursolic acid, a ubiquitous triterpenoid in higher plants. This compound was found to show inhibitory activity against mammalian DNA polymerases and , and human DNA topoisomerases I and II. It also inhibits bovine DNA polymerase , rat polymerase , HIV reverse transcriptase. It was also found to lower transcription of COX-2 by inhibition of the signal pathways PKC and AP-1. As the expression of PKC and AP-1 is elevated in a number of tumors, thus targeting these molecules is one of the aims of antiproliferative therapy [18].One of the most important members of the oleanane group is oleanolic acid which is present in high concentration in the ginseng root and it showed a range of antitumour effects. Oleanolic acid was shown to induce differentiation in the teratocarcinoma cell line F9 [19]. Furthermore, it was found to exhibit also antimutagenic and antiangiogenic activities [20,21]. In addition, it also stimulates the release of NO and TNF-, including induction of iNOS activity and TNF-expression in macrophages. This effect is mediated by its ability to activate DNA binding to the transcription complex NF-B and thereby its activation. Maslinic acid, another oleanane triterpenoid which is present in high concentrations in the protective wax-like coating of olives, was shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on the growth of HT29 colon cancer cells [22]. Treatment with maslinic acid resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and caused apoptotic death in coloncancer cells. Mechanism study has revealed that maslinic acid inhibited considerably the expression of Bcl-2 whilst increasing that of Bax. It also stimulated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome-c and activated caspases 9 and 3. Finally, for the dammarane group, fomitellic acids A and B, the secondary metabolites of basidiomycete Fomitella fraxinea, were shown to inhibit mammalian DNA polymerase and , and human DNA topoisomerase I and II. It exhibited also cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines NUGC-3, and PC-12 where differentiation was observed with subcytotoxic concentrations [23].In the course of our research program on isolation, synthesis and evaluation of anticancer activity of plant natural products, we have evaluated the capacity of two dammarane type triterpenes (1 and 2), four tirucallane type triterpenes (3-6, Fig. 1) and eight  limonoids (7-14, Fig. 2) to inhibit the in vitro growth of three human tumor cell lines namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5). Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the four most active compounds was also investigated for their effects on the cell cycle profile and the programmed cell death of the NCI-H460 cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General Experimental1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 , at ambient temperature on a Bruker ARX 400 instrument operating at 400 and 80 MHz, respectively. The Shimadzu LC-6AD model HPLC equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-6AV UV detector (240 and 215 nm) and a Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2Ga column (400 x 25 mm, 5 m particle size) was used. For column chromatography, Silica gel 60 (Acros organics) and Sephadex LH 20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB) were used. Solvents were from Synt and reagents were from SIGMA, unless otherwise stated.
Extraction and Isolation of the Compounds
Isolation of Cabraleadiol (1) and Ocotillone (2)Fruits of Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. was collected in Federal University of Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The plant material was identified by T.D. Pennington of the Royal Botanical Garden, Kew (UK). A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of Departamento de Engenharia Florestral, Dendrologia of the Federal University of Viçosa.After removing seeds, dried fruits (460g) were ground and extracted with ethanol (3 x 500 mL), at room temperature and the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 88 g of a concentrated ethanolic extract which was dissolved in 400 ml of a 3:1 mixture of MeOH-H 2 O. The aqueous methanolic solution was partitioned successively with hexane (2x300 ml), CH 2 Cl 2 (2x300 ml) and EtOAc (2x300 ml) to furnish hexane (47.4 g), dichloromethane (5.4 g) and ethyl acetate (4.4 g) fractions. The hexane fraction was applied over a silica gel column (250 g) and eluted with hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 -EtOAc-MeOH gradient, eight 700 ml fractions were collected as follows: fr 1 (hexane), fr 2 (hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 , 1:1), fr 3 ((hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 , 3:7), Fr 4 (hexane), fr 5 (CH 2 Cl 2 -EtOAc, 1:1), fr 6 (EtOAc), fr 7 (EtOAc-MeOH, 1:1), fr 8 (MeOH). Fr. 2 (120 mg) was placed on a gel permeation column of Sephadex LH-20 (50 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of MeOH-CH 2 Cl 2 to afford three 250 ml subfractions. Subfr 2 (88.6 mg) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (15 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of hexane-Me 2 CO to give five 100 ml fractions. Frs 3 and 4, after evaporation of the solvent by reduced pressure, afforded, respectively, 24.4 mg of cabraleadiol (1) and 16.3 mg of ocotillone (2) whose structures were established by 1 H and 13 C NMR as well as comparison of their spectral and physical data with those reported in the literature [24,25].
Isolation of 7-Deacetoxy-7-Oxogedunin (7) and 6-Acetoxygedunin (10)Fruits of Carpa guianensis Aubl. were purchased from the city of Belém (Pará State, Brazil). Dried and ground fruit aril (160g) was extracted with MeOH (3 x 500 ml) at room temp. The methanolic solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 40 g of the crude methanol extract which was dissolved in 150 ml of a 4:1 mixture of MeOH-H 2 O and then partitioned with hexane (3x 150 ml) and EtOAc (3x 150 ml) to give, respectively 23 g and 15 g of hexane and ethyl acetate extracts. The ethyl acetate extract was  applied to a flash column chromatography of silica gel (200 g) and eluted with hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 -Me 2 CO -MeOH gradient, and 50 ml fractions were collected as follows: frs 1-2 (hexane), frs 3-6 (hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 , 7:3), frs 7-18 (hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 , 1:1), frs 18-21 (CH 2 Cl 2 ), frs 22-23 (CH 2 Cl 2 -Me 2 CO, 7:3), fr 24 (CH 2 Cl 2 -Me 2 CO, 1:4), fr.25 (150 ml, MeOH). Purification of fr 8 by isocratic HPLC, using a mixture of MeOH/ CH 2 Cl 2 (7:3) as solvent and a UV detection at 254 nm, yielded 32.1 mg of 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (7) and 55.8 mg of 6-acetoxygedunin (10) whose structures were established by comparison of their 1 H and 13 CNMR data with those reported in the literature [26].
Preparation of Acetonide of Odoradol (5)Odoratol (4, 25 mg) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of acetone and one drop of conc.H 2 SO 4 was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature, under N 2 atmosphere, for 3 h after which the solution was evaporated and the product was dissolved in ethyl acetate and the solution was washed with H 2 O to remove H 2 SO 4 . Evaporation of the solvent gave 15 mg of acetonide of odoratol (5).Isolations of the tirucallane triterpenes odoratone (3), odoratol (4), 22-hydroxytirucalla-7, 24-diene-2,3-dione ( 6) and the limonoids gedunin (8) and 7-deacetoxygedunin ( 9) from Cedrela odorata grafted on Toona cilata var. australis have been described previously by de Paula et al. [27,28]. Isolation and characterization of the limonoids 6 -acetoxy-14 ,15 -epoxyazadirone (11), cedrelone (12), toonacilin (13) from Toona ciliata were described by Neto et al. [29,30] while isolation of guyanin ( 14) from Hortia oreadica, was reported by Severino et al. [31].
Biological Activity
ReagentsRPMI-1640, foetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and trypsin were from Gibco Invitrogen Co. (Scotland, UK). Acetic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), penicillin, streptomycin, sulforhodamine B (SRB) and trypan blue were from Sigma Chemical Co (Saint Louis, USA). Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and Tris were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
Solutions of CompoundsStock solutions of compounds were prepared in DMSO and kept at -20 ºC. Appropriate dilutions of the compounds were freshly prepared just prior to each assay.
Cell LinesThree human tumour cell lines, MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma, ECACC), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer, a kind gift from NCI, Bethesda, USA) and A375-C5 (melanoma, ECACC) were grown as a monolayer and routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin), at 37 ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 .
Tumour Cell Growth AssayThe effect of the compounds on the growth of the described human tumour cell lines was evaluated according to the procedure adopted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) in the "In vitro Anticancer Drug Discovery Screen", which uses the proteinbinding dye SRB to assess cell growth [32,33]. The plating density of each cell line was 1.5 x 10 5 cells/ml for MCF-7, and 7.5 x 10 4 cells/ml for NCI-H460 and A375-C5. Cells were allowed to attach overnight in 96-well plates and were then exposed for 48 h to five serial concentrations of the compounds, starting from a maximum concentration of 150 μM (final concentration). At the end of this incubation period the adherent cells were fixed in situ with 10% TCA (final concentration), washed with distilled water and stained with 0.4% SRB (solubilised in 1% acetic acid). The bound stain was solubilised in 10 mM Tris and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader (EAR400 STL-Labinstruments). For each test compound and for each cell line a dose-response curve was made and the value of GI 50 , corresponding to the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the net cell growth, was calculated as described elsewhere [33]. Doxorubicin, used as a positive control, was tested in the same manner.
Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Profile and Levels of Apoptosis in the NCI-H460 Cell LineThe compounds with GI 50 bellow (or similar to) 10 M were selected for further analysis of their effect on cell cycle profile and apoptosis. These assays were carried out in the NCI-H460 cells, since they were one of the most sensitive cells to these compounds. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (7.5 10 4 cells/ml) and incubated at 37 ºC for 24 h, in order to adhere. Cells were then incubated for 48 h with complete medium (control), the compounds solvent (DMSO) or with the compounds at their respective GI 50 concentrations (determined by the SRB assay). Cells were then harvested and further processed for cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection.For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and subsequently resuspended in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cellular DNA content (for cell cycle analysis and presence of sub-G1 peak) was then analyzed as previously described [34], using an Epics XL-MCL Coulter flow cytometer, plotting at least 20,000 events per sample.Apoptosis was analyzed using the Human Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis Kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of phosphatidylserine externalization was processed using a flow cytometer plotting at least 20,000 events per sample (as above).Both cell cycle distribution and apoptosis data were analyzed using the FlowJo 7.2 software (Tree Star, Inc.). At least three independent experiments were carried out and results are presented as the average and standard error (SEM) of those experiments.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSix triterpenes (Fig. 1) and eight limonoids (Fig. 2) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the in vitro growth of three human tumour cell lines, namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), nonsmall lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5), using the protein-binding dye sulforhodamine B (SRB) method and their growth inhibitory effect, expressed as GI 50 ( M), is shown in Table 1.Following a continuous exposure for 48 h, all six triterpenes (1-6) and only four limonoids (8,11,12,13) were found to be active against all three tumour cell lines whereas the other four limonoids (7, 9, 10 and 14) were inactive (Table 1). The tirucallane triterpene odoradol (4) and the limonoids gedunin (8), 6 -acetoxy-14 ,15epoxyazadirone (11) and cedrelone (12) showed strong cell growth inhibitory activity, presenting their GI 50 values below 12 M for all three cell lines. Interestingly, the limonoid cedrelone ( 12) was found to be not only the most active growth inhibitor but also more selective on NCI-H460 (GI 50 = 2.77 ± 0.07 M) and A375-C5 (GI 50 = 2.60 ± 0.21 M) cell lines when compared to odoradol (4), gedunin (8) and 6 -acetoxy-14 ,15 -epoxyazadirone (11). While the dammarane cabraleadiol (1) showed moderate activity in all three cell lines (GI 50 >30 M), the tirucallane triterpenes odoratone (3) and 22-hydroxytirucalla-7,24-dien-2,3-dione (6) showed moderate growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but strong activity against A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, the dammarane triterpene ocotillone (2) showed only weak inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but moderate activity against A375-C5 cells whereas the limonoid toonacillin (13) showed weak inhibitory activity against all three cell lines. Though cabraleadiol (1) and ocotillone (2) are both 20, 24 -epoxydammarane, they differ only in the stereochemistry of C-24 and the functional group on C-3. With the C-24S configuration and the hydroxyl group on C-3, cabraleadiol (1) exhibited ca. three times higher in growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells than that of ocotillone (2) which has a ketone function on C-3 and the opposite configuration of C-24. However, the growth inhibitory effects on the A375-C5 cells are similar for both compounds. In fact, cabraleadiol (1), isolated from various plant sources, has been previously tested for its cytotoxicity against various tumour cell lines. Phongmaykin et al. [35] reported a weak cytotoxic effect of this compound, isolated from Chisocheton penduliflorus (Meliaceae), on a breast cancer (BC) cell line. Qiu et al. [24] have found no cytotoxic effect of cabraleadiol (1), isolated from Aglaia lawii, on the LNcaP, Col 2 and KB cancer cell lines. On the other hand, ocotillone (2), isolated from Betula platyphylla var. japonica, was evaluated against a variety of human cancer cell lines, and was found to show no cytotoxicity against the KB (human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx), K562 (leukemia), MCF7 (breast carcinoma), and COLO205 (colon carcinoma) cell lines. Interestingly, though ocotillone (2) did not exhibit any cytotoxicity against KB-C2 (cochicine-resistant KB) cells (IC 50 values >100 M), it was found to show moderate cytotoxic activity (with IC 50 ranging from 20.6 to 64.2 M) in the presence of 2.5 M colchicine. The enhanced cytotoxicity of ocotillone (2) against KB-C2 cells in the presence of 2.5 M colchicine as compared with that in the absence of colchicine, suggesting that this triterpene might show some MDR-reversing effects [25]. For the tirucallane triterpenes, odoratol (4) was the most active analogue exhibiting GI 50 values in the rank of 10 M. Replacing the hydroxyl group on C-3 of odoratol (4) by a ketone group in odoratone (3) caused a two fold decrease of the growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cell lines; however this structural alteration did not affect the growth inhibitory activity against the A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, transforming the vic diol functionality on the furan ring of odoratol (4) into its acetonide (5) led to a loss of activity.Concerning the limonoids, the most active analogue was cedrelone (12), exhibiting GI 50 values below 5 M in all three cell lines. Although the capacity of cedrelone (12) to inhibit the in vitro growth of human tumour cells have not been previously reported, this compound is known to demonstrate several other activities including insecticide [36], antifeedant [37] and antifungal activity [38]. Although its growth inhibitory effect was ca. two folds less than that of cedrelone, the structurally related limonoid 6 -acetoxy-14 ,15 -epoxyazadirone (11) also exhibited strong growth inhibitory activity against all three cancer cell lines. Interestingly, Maneerat et al. [39] have found that 6 -acetoxyepoxyazadione, isolated from Chisocheton siamensis and which differs from 11 only in the presence of the carbonyl group on C-16 of the former, was inactive against oral human epidermal carcinoma (KB), small cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) and breast cancer (MCF-7). Among the limonoids whose structure possessing the lactone moiety on the ring D, gedunin (8) was the only member which exhibited strong growth inhibitory activity against all three human tumour cell lines (GI 50 10 M); however 7-deacetylgedunin (9) was inactive. Interestingly, Brandt et al. [40] have evaluated, among several analogues, gedunin (8) and 7-deacetylgedunin (9), obtained from neem oils, for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cell lines. While gedunin (8) was found to exhibit strong antiproliferative activity against both cell lines (IC 50 = 8.84±0.03 for MCF-7 and 3.22± 0.6 for SKBr3), 7-deacetylgedunin (9) showed only moderate activity (IC 50 = 28.96±4.48 for MCF-7 and 21.09± 5.95 for SKBr3). Gedunin (8) was also shown to manifest anticancer activity via inhibition of the 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) folding machinery [41] and to induce the degradation of Hsp90-dependent client proteins similar to other Hsp90 inhibitors [42].In order to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory activity of the most active compounds, they were assayed for their effect on the cell cycle profile of the NCI-H460 cells. Thus, NCI-H460 cells were treated with odoratol (4), gedunin (8), 6 -acetoxy-14 ,15 -epoxyazadirone (11) and cedrelone (12) at their respective GI 50 concentrations (values of GI 50 for NCI-H460 from Table 1) for 48 h and processed for cell cycle analysis. Results (Fig. 3) show that the majority of the compounds tested (with the exception of 11) affected the normal cell cycle distribution of the NCI-H460 cells. Odoratol (4) was found to induce a cell cycle ar- rest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% cells in this phase upon DMSO treatment to 70% of cells following treatment with this compound), causing a decrease in the % of cells in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 13%) and G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 11%) phases of the cell cycle. Upon treatment with gedunin (8), the cell cycle progression was blocked (arrested) in the S phase (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 60%), leading to a decrease in the % of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). Incubation with cedrelone ( 12) caused an accumulation of cells (arrest) in the S (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 40%) and the G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to 43%) phases of the cell cycle, with a concomitant decrease in the % of cells in G1 (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). In addition, there were indications that odoratol (4), gedunin (8) and cedrelone (12) induced apoptosis because of the increase in the sub-G1 population of cells when compared to control. Therefore, a specific apoptosis assay was carried out. Indeed, annexin-V-FITC/PI staining was performed to determine the % of cells in early and late apoptosis (and necrosis) by flow cytometry, following treatment of NCI-H460 cells with the selected compounds. Results showed that for all tested compounds, but very modestly for odoratol (4) and 6 -acetoxy-14 ,15epoxyazadirone (11), the % of cells in early (annexin V positive, PI negative) or late apoptosis (annexin V-positive, PI positive) were increased upon treatment of cells with the GI 50 concentration of the compounds (Table 2). Gedunin (8) caused an increase in cell death from approximately 12.6% in controls (or 11.2% in DMSO control) to 47.2% in cells treated for 48 h with the GI 50 concentration of this compound. Indeed, cedrelone (12) was particularly effective in inducing programmed cell death, causing 80.3% of cell death upon 48 h treatment of the cells with its GI 50 concentration. It would be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the observed apoptotic inducing effects, particularly the effects on caspase activation and PARP cleavage. In addition, the involvement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway could be investigated, by analyzing the levels of Bax and other apoptosis related proteins, such as Bcl-2 or BcL-xL. This would be possible by analyzing extracts of cells treated with the compounds (with or without caspase inhibitors) for the levels of apoptosis associated proteins, by Western Blot with appropriate antibodies, as has been carried out by others for example in order to study the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by lupeol [43].
CONCLUSIONSix triterpenes (two dammaranes and four tirucallanes) and eight limonoids, isolated from the members of the families Meliaceae and Rutaceae, were evaluated by the SRB method for their cytotoxic effect against three human tumour cell lines. The tirucallane triterpene odoratol (4) and the limonoids gedunin (8), 6 -acetoxy-14 ,15 -epoxyazadirone (11), cedrelone (12) were the most active inhibitors of cell growth (GI 50 less than 12 μM). Of these, cedrelone (12) has shown to be the most active growth inhibitor, presenting GI 50 values below 4.20 μM in all three tested cell lines.From the analysis of the cell cycle profile in NCI-H460 cells, it was possible to conclude that odoratol (4) arrests cell cycle at the G1 phase, gedunin (8) causes cell cycle arrest at the S phase and cedrelone (12) at the S and G2M phases while 6 -acetoxy-14 ,15epoxyazadirone (11) did not affect the cell cycle profile of these cells. In addition, analysis of programmed cell death indicates that odoratol (4) and 6 -acetoxy-14 ,15 -epoxyazadirone (11) cause a very small increase in cell death but gedunin (8) and particularly cedrelone (12), are very potent inducers of programmed cell death. In conclusion, cedrelone (12) is very potent by causing cell cycle  arrest and programmed cell death, which makes it a very interesting compound for further studies in order to investigate its full potential as antitumor agent.It is evident from the number of recent studies that triterpenoid compounds represent a promising and expanding platform for natural anticancer agents whose potential is currently still not fully exploited by pharmaceutical industry. As a number of recently studied triterpenoids compare very favourably with drugs in current use [44], it is foreseeable that attention of many research institutions and pharmaceutical companies will be drawn to this class of compounds.Fig. ( 1 ).1Fig. (1).
