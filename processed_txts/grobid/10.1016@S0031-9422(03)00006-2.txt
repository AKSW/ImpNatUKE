Alkaloids from Dictyoloma vandellianum: their chemosystematic significance
The dichloromethane extract from leaves of Dictyoloma vandellianum afforded five alkaloids 2-(14 0 -hydroxy-14 0 ,15 0 -dimethylhexadecanyl)-4-quinolone, 2-(12 0 -hydroxy-12 0 -methyltridecanyl)-3-methoxy-4-quinolone, 2-(12 0 -hydroxy-12 0 -methyltridecanyl)-4quinolone, 2-(14 0 -hydroxy-14 0 ,15 0 -dimethylhexadecanyl)-3-methoxy-4-quinolone, 6-methoxydictyolomide A, besides the known alkaloid 8-methoxyflindersine and b-sitosterol. The presence of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones in D. vandellianum shows strong similarities with the Zanthoxyleae, which contains several 2-alkyl-4-quinolones. Thus, the Dictyolomatoideae apparently occupies a position between the proto-Rutaceae genera and the Spathelioideae, but close to the Zanthoxyleae.

IntroductionDictyoloma Juss. contains only two species, D. vandellianum Adr. Juss. (syn. D. incanescens DC), which occurs in Brazil, and D. peruvianum from Peru (Engler, 1874(Engler, , 1931;;Macbride, 1949). The taxonomy of this genus has been doubtful since its initial description in 1825, when Jussieu classified it in the Rutaceae, assigning it to the tribe Zanthoxyleae. According to the concept of Bentham and Hooker (1862), Dictyoloma belongs to the Simaroubaceae ''ordo''. Engler (1874) first included this genus in the Simaroubaceae, but later removed it to the Rutaceae, classifying Dictyoloma as the single genus in the subfamily Dictyolomatoideae (von Engler, 1931).D. vandellianum is known to contain indole alkaloids, 2-quinolinone alkaloids, prenylated chromones, and limonoids (Vieira et al., 1988(Vieira et al., , 1990;;Campos et al., 1987). The occurrence of these compounds was important for systematic classification of the genus in the Rutaceae family. In this paper the isolation and identification of five 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones from the leaves of D. vandellianum are described. The chemosystematic significance of the presence of limonoids, alkaloids, and chromones in Dictyoloma in providing a better understanding of the phylgenetic relationships in the Rutales is also discussed.
Results and discussionThe dichloromethane extract from the leaves of D. vandellianum afforded five alkaloids 1-5, besides the known alkaloid 8-methoxyflindersine (Auzi et al., 1997) and b-sitosterol.Compound 1 showed the spectral characteristics of a 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone (Tang et al., 1996). Elemental analysis and ESI-MS indicated the molecular formula to be C 27 H 43 NO 2 . The IR spectrum showed a weak a,b-unsaturated carbonyl band at 1634 cm À1 , which can be explained by the carbonyl group being partially enolized. The UV absorption maximum at 236, 314 and 325 nm suggested that N in the 4(1H)-quinolone system was unsubstituted, when compared with 2-tridecyl-4(1H)quinolone (6) and 1-methyl-2-dodecyl-4(1H)-quinolone (Tang et al., 1996). The 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1), in addition to signals typical of a 4(1H)-quinolone ( 6.22, s, H-3; four aromatic protons at 8.35, d, J=8.0 Hz, H-5; 7.32, dt, J=8.0 and 1.8 Hz, H-6; 7.56, dt, J=8.0 and 1.5 Hz, H-7; 7.60, dd, J=8.0 and 1.8 Hz, H-8; thus an unsubstituted A ring), revealed a methyl singlet at 1.40 and two methyl doublets at 1.20 and 1.12 (J=7.0 Hz). The two methyl doublets were coupled to the 1 H signal at 2.45 (sept, J=7.0 Hz), thus placing an isopropyl group at the end of the side chain. The 13 C NMR spectrum (Table 2) revealed resonances for C-2-C-8 in close agreement with those for 2-tridecyl-4(1H)-quinolone (6) (Tang et al., 1996), with an aliphatic chain of 16 carbon atoms. The two methyl doublets at 1.20 and 1.12 and the 1 H signal at 2.45 showed one-bond correlations (HSQC) with the 13 C signals at 19.0 and 35.0, permitting the assignment of these signals to isopropyl group as Me-16/Me-17 and CH-15, respectively. HSQC experiments also showed a correlation from methyl singlet at 1.40 to the 13 C signal at 26.1. Hydroxyl and methyl groups must be connected at the same carbon in the side chain, considering the observed signal for a hydroxytertiary carbon at 82.2. This was supported by the ESI-MS data which showed fragments at m/z 326 [C 27 H 43 NO 2 +HÀC 5 H 12 O] + (40%) due to fission of the side chain between C-13 0 and C-14 0 , thus indicating the hydroxyl and methyl groups to be located a (at C-14 0 ) to the isopropyl group. The signals at 26.1 and 82.2 were then assigned to C-18 0 and C-14 0 , respectively. The downfield signal at 2.64 (t, J=7.8 Hz) from the methylene H 2 -1 0 was consistent with its situation being a to the 4(1H)-quinolone system. The observed correlation between this signal and the 13 C signal at 34.3 led to its assignment to C-1 0 . Moreover, the 13 C NMR spectrum also showed a downfield signal at 40.1, which was consistent for a methylene group with an electronegative element nearby; thus it was assigned to C-13 0 . The slightly negative g effect of the hydroxyl group permitted the assignment of C-11 0 at 23.3. However, the signals at 28.8-29.6 for 10 methylenes (C-2 0 -C-10 0 and C-12 0 ) were less readily assignable; indeed, the assignments may be interchanged with each other. In addition, HSQC experiments showed correlation from the signal in the olefinic region at 6.22 (s) to the 13 C signal at 108.5, suggesting a methine proton adjacent to double bond of the 4(1H)-quinolone system, which were assigned to H-3 and C-3, respectively, since C-2 is more deshielded than C-3 because of the deshielding effect of the electronegative nitrogen. This evidence determined the position of the aliphatic chain at C-2. The new alkaloid was therefore identified as 2-(14 0hydroxy-14 0 ,15 0 -dimethylhexadecanyl)-4-quinolone (1).Compound 2 gave rise to UV (239, 330 and 348 nm) and IR (a weak carbonyl band at 1658 cm À1 ) spectra which indicated the presence of an 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone nucleus. Elemental analysis and ESI-MS indicated the molecular formula to be C 24 H 37 NO 3 , requiring the presence of an aliphatic chain shorter than C 16 , when compared with 1. In the NMR spectrum of 2, four aromatic protons at 8.40 (bd, J=8.0 Hz, H-5), 7.31 (dt, J=8.0 and 1.5 Hz, H-6), 7.51 (dt, J=8.0 and 1.2 Hz, H-7) and 7.59 (dd, J=8.0 and 1.5 Hz, H-8) (Table 1), clearly indicated an A ring similar to 1. The spectrum also revealed a singlet at 3.92 corresponding to one methoxyl group. Furthermore, it did not show the signal for the conjugated olefinic proton ca 6.22 (H-3), thereby locating the methoxyl group at C-3. These data resulted in the construction of a 3-methoxy-4(1H)-quinolone (C 10 H 8 NO 2 ). Hydroxyl and two methyl groups must be connected at the same carbon in the side chain, since signals for a hydroxytertiary carbon at 71.3 and two methyl singlets at H 1.20 (s, 6H) and C 29.2 in the 13 C (Table 2) and 1 H NMR spectra, respectively. The ESI-MS showed an ion at m/z 328 [C 24 H 37 NO 3 +HÀC 3 H 8 O] + , confirming the presence of an 12 0 -hydroxy-12 0 -methyltridecanyl chain (C 24 H 37 NO 3 -C 10 H 8 NO 2 = C 14 H 29 O). 13 C NMR assignments for 2 were made using 1 as model. The downfield signals at 43.7 (CH 2 , DEPT) and 29.2 (CH 3 , DEPT), which were appropriate for a methylene and methyl groups with an electronegative element nearby, were thus assigned to C-11 0 and C-13 0 /C-14 0 , respectively. Moreover, the slightly negative g effect of the hydroxyl group permitted the assignment of C-9 0 at 24.3. Thus, the structure of the new alkaloid was characterized as 2-(12 0 -hydroxy-12 0 -methyltridecanyl)-3methoxy-4-quinolone (2). Compound 3 had NMR spectra (Tables 1 and2) similar to 2, except for the absence of a signal for a methoxyl group, and the signal for H-3 was visible as a singlet at 6.17. Elemental analysis and ESI-MS indicated the molecular formula to be C 23 H 35 NO 2 , confirming that the difference between 3 and 2 is the absence of one methoxyl group at C-3. The presence of a 4(1H)-quinolone nucleus was also suggested by its UV (238, 325 and 335 nm) and IR (1657 cm À1 ) spectra. The observed signals for a hydroxytertiary carbon at 71.2 and two methyl singlets at H 1.20 (s, 6H) and C 29.1 in the 13 C (Table 2) and 1 H NMR spectra, together with the ion at m/z 298 [C 23 H 35 NO 2 +HÀC 3 H 8 O] + in the ESI-MS, confirmed the presence of an 12 0 -hydroxy-12 0methyltridecanyl chain. The complete assignment of chemical shifts for all carbons are given in Table 2. Using compounds 1 and 2 as models, the structure of 3 was elucidated as 2-(12 0 -hydroxy-12 0 -methyltridecanyl)-4-quinolone.Compound 4, C 28 H 45 NO 3 (EA/ESI-MS), also showed the UV (237, 288 and 335 nm) and IR ( 1636 cm À1 ) spectral characteristics of an 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra showed signals typical of a 3-methoxy-4-quinolone ( H 8.40, dd, J=8.0 and 1.0 Hz, H-5; 7.28, t, J=8.0 Hz, H-6; 7.55, t, J=8.0 Hz, H-7; 7.78, d, 8.0 Hz, H-8; 3.90, s, OMe; C =147.6; C-3) very close related to those in 2, and of a 14 0 -hydroxy-14 0 ,15 0dimethylhexadecanyl side chain ( H 2.86, t, J=7.2 Hz, H-1 0 ; 1.68-1.72, m, H-2 0 -H-13 0 ; 2.44, sept, J=7.0 Hz, H-15; 1.10, d, J=7.0 Hz, Me-16 0 /Me-17 0 ; 1.40, s, Me-18 0 ; C 82.1, C-14 0 ); as in 1. This was supported by the mass spectrum, which showed fragments at m/z 356 [C 28 H 45 NO 3 +HÀC 5 H 12 O] + (80%) due to fission of the side chain between C-13 0 and C-14 0 . The structure of this alkaloid was thus established as 2-(14 0 -hydroxy-14 0 ,15 0dimethylhexadecanyl)-3-methoxy-4-quinolone (4).Compound 5, C 20 H 25 NO 2 (EA/ESI-MS), belonged to the same class of molecules as 1-4. The 4-quinolone skeleton was recognized on the basis of UV (240, 331 and 347 nm) and IR (1648 cm À1 ) spectra. In the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra the absence of signals for N-H ca. 10-12 and N-Me ca. C 34, suggested the presence of a third ring. Compound 5 exhibited similar NMR spectra to dictyolomide A (7) (Lavaud et al., 1995). The 1 H NMR revealed the presence of a methoxyl group ( H 3.93) and of three aromatic protons ( H 7.87, d, J=3.3 Hz; 7.26, dd, J=10.0 and 3.3 Hz; 7.52, d, J=10.0 Hz). From HMBC experiments (see Experimental), the observed correlation between the 1 H signal at 7.87 (d, J=3.3 Hz) and the 13 C signal at 176.5 ( 3 J) led to their assignment as H-5 and C-4, respectively, thus indicating the methoxyl group to be located at C-6 and permitting the assignments of the signals at 7.26 (dd, J=10.0 and 3.3 Hz) and 7.52 (d, J=10.0 Hz) to H-7 and H-8, respectively. Moreover, the existence of a correlation between the 1 H signal at 6.20, assigned to H-3, and the 13 C signal at 29.7 suggested a methylene substituent at C-2. This correlation, COSY experiments and the chemical shift of a methylene at C 51.5 indicated the presence of a structural unit, -CH 2 -CH 2 -CH-CH 2 -N-in ring B ( H 2.97, dt, J=10.0 and 5.0 Hz, H-1 0 a, 2.94, dt, J=10.0 and 5.0 Hz, H-1 0 b, C 1 0 29.7; 2.07, m, H-2 0 a, 1.48, m, H-2 0 b, C 2 0 25.3; 2.07, m, H-3 0 , C 3 0 33.7; H 3.55, dd, J=12.0 and 10.2 Hz, H-4 0 a, 4.26, dd, J=12.0 and 6.3 Hz, H-4 0 b, C 4 0 51.5), confirming a third ring as a piperidine substituent. The methylene signal at 3.55 showed a long-range correlation ( 3 J) with the methylene signal at 34.1, suggesting the presence of a methylene at C-3 0 of piperidine ring. This methylene signal was coupled to another methylene signal at 2.21, which was coupled to the olefinic proton signal at 5.33. The latter resonance was coupled to the 1 H signal at 5.45, which showed a one-bond correlation with the 13 C signal at 133.0. The methyl proton at 0.98 showed cross peaks with the 13 C signals at 133.0 ( 3 J) and 20.8 ( 2 J; CH 2 by HSQC and DEPT). These correlations resulted in the construction of a C 6 H 11 linear chain containing a disubstituted double bond between the third (C-3 00 ) and fourth (C-4 00 ) carbons. The cis-configuration of the double bond was deduced from the small coupling  ), confirming the presence of a piperidine ring and a alkenyl chain at C-3 0 . These data were consistent with the structure of 6-methoxydictyolomide A (5).A model shows that in the piperidine moiety, H-3 0 is not rigidly antiperiplanar with respect to one of the protons 2H-4 0 . In the isomer in which H-3 0 b is antiperiplanar to H-4 0 a (J is large), the alkenyl chain is in a pseudoequatorial conformation (a). However, the large coupling constant of the C-4 0 methylene protons to H-3 0 is also consistent with their situation in a second isomer in which H-3 0 a is antiperiplanar to H-4 0 b (J is large), requiring the alkenyl chain to be in a pseudoequatorial conformation (b). The NOESY experiments showed correlations of H-4 0 at 3.55 (J 4 0 -3 0 =10.2) with H-2 0 b at 1.48. However, a spatial proximity of one H 2 -4 0 to H 2 -2 is possible for each of the isomers discussed above. When one of the H-4 0 a and H-2 0 a protons are in spatial proximity on the b-side, H-3 0 is on the a-side of the molecule, then the alkenyl chain is also on the b-side, but in a pseudoequatorial conformation. If it is presumed that H-3 0 is on the b-side in a pseudoaxial conformation, the other H-4 0 ba and H-2 0 ba are also in a spatial proximity. Therefore, these observations do not allow determination of the C-3 0 stereochemistry. However, compound 5 was presumed to be 3 0 -(S)-6-methoxydictyolomide A based on the chemical shift of C-3 0 ( C 33.7) and its comparison with those of oblonginine (8, 25a-Me, C 32.8), and shinonomenine (9, 25b-Me, C 28.0) (Kadota et al., 1995). As a further confirmation of the assignments, the synthesis of 5, under chiral control at C-3 0 , is in progress.The results provide firm support for including the genus Dictyoloma in the Rutaceae. An examination of the systematic distribution of alkaloids, coumarins, limonoids, flavonoids and chromones in the Rutales led Waterman (1983) to propose the biochemical evolution of the order. Limonoids and quassinoids, two biosynthetically related compounds, are found in the Simaroubaceae, Meliaceae, Rutaceae, and Cneoraceae (da Silva et al., 1984(da Silva et al., , 1987)). There are fairly consistent differences between the limonoids of the Rutaceae and those of the Meliaceae, the quassinoids being restricted to the Simaroubaceae. According to Waterman (1983), a consideration of other classes of secondary metabolites leads to the conclusion that Meliaceae, Cneoraceae, and Simaroubaceae have all evolved from proto-rutaceous stock. Furthermore, the enormous variety of alkaloids and coumarins in the Rutaceae, not found in the other families, is taken to suggest that substantial chemical evolution must have occurred in the diversification of this large family after Cneoraceae, Meliaceae, and Simaroubaceae lines split off. In the Simaroubaceae, Harrisonia is exceptional (da Silva et al., 1984(da Silva et al., , 1987)), since no quassinoids have so far been isolated from it. Its limonoid types, however, suggest strong affinity with rutaceous genera such as Spathelia. Besides, both Harrisonia and Spathelia contain chromones which have not been found in other Simaroubaceae or Rutaceae, but do occur in the Ptaeroxylaceae and Cneoraceae (Waterman, 1983). These deductions were incorporated by Waterman (1983) into a phylogenetic diagram (Fig. 1). In 1983, the only phytochemical knowledge of Dictyoloma was the record of a simple indole (N,N-dimethyl-5-methoxytryptamine; Mester, 1983), of little value for the purpose of a taxonomic position of Dictyolomatoideae into Waterman's phylogenetic diagram.The 2-quinolone alkaloids, limonoids, and chromones that have recently been isolated from Dictyoloma vandellianum provide firm support for including the subfamily Dictyolomatoideae near the allied taxa Spathelioideae, Ptaeroxylaceae, Cneoraceae, and Harrisonia (Vieira et al., 1988(Vieira et al., , 1990)). Now, the finding of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones in D. vandellianum showed strong similarities with Zanthoxyleae [Platydesma and Tetradium (T. ruticarpum=Euodia rutaecarpa)], Ruteae (Haplophyllum and Ruta), Boronieae (Boronia), Cusparieae (Raulinoa), and Toddalieae (Acronychia,Vepris andPtelea), which contain several 2-alkyl-4-quinolones (Mester, 1983;Biavatti et al., 2002). Dictyoloma,Tetradium, Raulinoa, and Vepris also produce limonoids (Vieira et al., 1988(Vieira et al., , 1990;;Ng et al., 1987;Biavatti et al., 2001;daSilva et al., 1984daSilva et al., , 1987)), suggesting a relative advance. These phytochemical data are in line with the view of Waterman (1987) who consider genera of the Rutaceae, which produce the full range of advanced rutalean metabolites (furoquinoline alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids), as arising from a progenitor with the metabolic profile of Tetradium. Interestingly, de Jussieu (1825) classified the genus Dictyoloma in the same tribe of Tetradium, Zanthoxyleae. Thus, in Waterman's phylogenetic diagram (Fig. 1), Dictyolomatoideae apparently occupies a position between the proto-Rutaceae genera and the Spathelioideae, but close to Zanthoxyleae. This interpretation of chemical data is consistent with available DNA sequences. The analysis of DNA sequence data from members of the Cneoraceae, Meliaceae, Ptaeroxylaceae, Rutaceae, and Simaroubaceae, showed that the Rutaceae are paraphyletic, with Spathelia and Dictyoloma (Rutaceae), Harrisonia (Simaroubaceae), Cneorum (Cneoraceae), and Ptaeroxylon (Ptaeroxylaceae) forming a clade sister to all other Rutaceae. Circumscription of Rutaceae to include all of these taxa was recommended. This analysis also indicated that the Simaroubaceae and Meliaceae are the outgroups closest to Rutaceae (Chase et al., 1999;Scott et al., 2000). 
Isolation of compoundsGround leaves (300 g) were extracted with hexane, then CH 2 Cl 2 and finally with MeOH. The conc. CH 2 Cl 2 extract was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with hexane, followed by a CH 2 Cl 2 -EtOAc-Me 2 CO-MeOH gradient yielded eight frs. Fr. 2 was subjected to cellulose chromatography eluting with a hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 -EtOAc gradient to afford 8-methoxyflindersine (3 mg) and additional frs. Fr. 2.1 was applied twice (Sephadex LH-20, EtOAc; then silica gel, hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 -EtOAc gradient) to give b-sitosterol (13 mg). Fr. 5 was subjected twice to Sephadex LH-20 (CHCl 3 -MeOH, 1:1) yielding new frs., with Fr. 5.2, following flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with a CH 2 Cl 2 -EtOAc-MeOH gradient, affording new frs. Fr. 5.2.1 was applied to Sephadex LH-20 (EtOAc) to give 1 (8 mg) and a new fr. containing 2. The latter was purified by prep. TLC (silica gel, CH 2 Cl 2 -EtOAc, 6:4) to give 20 mg of 2. Fr. 5.3 was subjected three times to Sephadex LH-20 (CHCl 3 -MeOH, 1:1; MeOH; EtOAc) to afford a new fr., which was purified by prep.
