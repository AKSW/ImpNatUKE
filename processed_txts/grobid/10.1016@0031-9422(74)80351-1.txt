FLAVANS FROM IR YAM-HERA SPECIES*
Myrlstlcaceae;(&)-3',4-dlhydroxy-5,7-dlmethoxyflavan, (+)-2'-hydroxy-7-methoxy-4',5'-methylenedloxyflavan Iryanthera coriacea Ducke and I. juruensu Warb. (Myristicaceae) grow in the Amazonian forest near Manaus. From the trunk wood extracts closely related phenols, resp. C,7H,80s and C,7H,605, were isolated. The PMR spectra allowed expansion of these formulaetoC,~H100.20H.20MeandC~~H100.OH.OMe.0~CH,andindicatedthat in each case five of the undefined hydrogens are aromatic, requiring the presence of two aromatic rings, and five are aliphatic. Since the IR spectra do not register carbonyl absorption, the undefined oxygens must participate in ether functions. If these were cyclic, as is most probable, then all hydrogen deficiencies would have been pinpointed in both cases. Indeed, in the PMR spectra of both, signals of one aliphatic proton are completely analyzable (resp. T 5.17, dd, J 8.5, 35 Hz; z 4.90, J 7.5, 5.5 Hz) and represent a benzylic axial oxymethine hydrogen which is vlcinal to two other hydrogens. These and the additional pair give rise to multlplets (resp. z 8, 7.4 and z 7.7, 7.1), one at a chemical shift value consistent with the benzylic nature of the corresponding methylene group. The combined data show both to be flavans, even if of different aromatic substitution and heterocychc conformation.The difference m conformation is portrayed by the difference in chemical shift and coupling constants of the H-2 signals and must, clearly, be due to absence or presence of a hydroxyl at C-2' as depicted resp. in 1 and 2. In 1, the aryl group at C-2 is free to avoid interference of the hydrogens at C-6' and C-3. Free rotation IS not feasible m the hydrogen bonded derivative 2 and the interference can only be attenuated by diminution of the dihedral angle Heq-C(3)-C(2)-H, expressed by enhanced coupling constants. As expected, acetylation, destroying the H-bridge, equalizes chemical shift and coupling constants of the oxymethine signals of 1 and 2.If, as these data indicate, 1 lacks a hydroxyl at C-2', the ortho-dihydroxy system of this cmpd. (UV shift upon addition of borate) must occupy C-3',4'. The locatlon of both these hydroxyls on ring B, and indeed, the general distribution of all substltuents among the rings was given by MS: By far the most intense peaks appeared at m/e values interpreted to represent the molecular ions 1: 302 (81x), 2: 300 (100x), and the retro Duels-Alder ions mcorporatmg rings A after capture of a hydrogen 1. 167 (loons,), 2 137 (907;,) and B I : 136 (42x), 2. 164 (SO:<).(1)(2)Final proof for these structures was obtained through acetylation With 1 this produced a paramagnetic shift (A 0.43 ppm) of an aromatic 3-hydrogen multlplet m the PMR spectrum. The additional signal m the aromatic region, which was not affected, 1s located at high field (T 3.92; AB system, J 3 Hz) and can represent only the IIIC~U related protons of the phloroglucinol-type, fully etherlfied, A-ring. Analogously. acetylatlon produced a paramagnetic shift (A 0.47 ppm) only of one of the aromatic proton singlets (r 3.55) m the PMR spectrum of 2. Neither the other singlet (t 3.42) nor the 3 multlplets were affected One of these, an ortho split doublet (z 3.05. J 8 Hz), appears at considerably lower field than all other signals (z 3.42--3 60) and must, consequently, represent a proton which IS rnrtn related to oxyfunctlons, a requirement satisfied by H-5 If the methoxql IS placed at C-7 PHYrn 73,&Y
