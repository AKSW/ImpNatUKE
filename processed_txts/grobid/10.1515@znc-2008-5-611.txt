Enzymatic Inhibitory Activity and Trypanocidal Effects of Extracts and Compounds from Siphoneugena densiflora O. Berg and Vitex polygama Cham
Hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, and 34 isolated compounds from Vitex polygama Cham. (Lamiaceae, formely Verbenaceae) and Siphoneugena densiflora O. Berg (Myrtaceae) were screened for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei, as well as for their enzymatic inhibitory activities on glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and trypanothione reductase (TR) enzymes from T. cruzi and adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) enzyme from Leishmania tarentolae. In general, polar extracts displayed strong effects and some of the tested compounds have shown good results in comparison to positive controls of the bioassays.

IntroductionSiphoneugena densiflora O. Berg commonly known as Uvatinga belongs to the family Myrtaceae and occurs in grasslands ("campos rupestres"), deciduous forests ("cerrado ˜es") and gallery forests in Goia ´s, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais and Sa ˜o Paulo States of Brazil. This plant takes part in a genus comprising only nine species; two of them are vulnerable to extinction in Sa ˜o Paulo State (Programa Biota FAPESP, 2007) and one species, S. delicata, has been recently described (Sobral and Proenc ¸a, 2006). S. densiflora has been biologically and chemically researched by our group (Gallo et al., 2006a, b, c) since neither data about it could be found in the literature nor popular use has been registered.Vitex polygama Cham. (Lamiaceae, formely Verbenaceae) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the states of Minas Gerais, Espı ´rito Santo, Rio de Janeiro 0939Ð5075/2008/0500Ð0371 $ 06.00 " 2008 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen • http://www.znaturforsch.com • D and Sa ˜o Paulo, and is commonly called "Taruma ˜". Its leaf tea is used in folk medicine to treat kidney infections (Rodrigues, 2001;Gallo et al., 2008). Several of its compounds had already been characterized and bioassayed (Leita ˜o et al., 1997;Leita ˜o and Delle Monache, 1998;Santos et al., 2001;Mensor et al., 2001), but none was regarded as neither potential trypanocidal nor enzyme inhibitor.Trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis are major diseases in developing countries which continue to infect millions of people and are responsible for a mortality rate of over one million per year. At present, only ineffective, impractical or severely toxic chemotherapeutic agents, requiring a complicated regimen, are available for the treatment of these infections (WHO, 2007); hence there is a pressing need to find novel antiprotozoal agents.Trypanosomatids have no functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, and their bloodstream forms are highly dependent on glycolysis to the stage of pyruvate as sole energy supply. Trypanosome glycoly-sis occurs in a specific microbody called glycosome. Accordingly, the inhibition of enzymes of this physiologically important metabolic pathway should deprive the parasite of the energy necessary for survival (Opperdoes and Michels, 2001). The glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme of Trypanosoma cruzi catalyzes the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate in the presence of NAD + and inorganic phosphate. The in silico modeling of this pathway has indicated this catalyzed reaction as one of the preferred steps for inhibition (Bakker et al., 2000). In addition, Trypanosomatidae have dithiol trypanothione [bis(glutathionyl)spermidine]-conjugated enzymes, specially trypanothione reductase (TR) (Fairlamb et al., 1995), that helps to protect the parasites from oxidative stress by maintaining an intracellular reducing milieu through reduction of the N 1 ,N 8 -(bisglutathionyl)spermidine conjugate trypanothione (T[S] 2 ) to dihydrotrypanothione (T[SH] 2 ). TR participates in the inactivation of potentially damaging radicals and reactive oxygen species, and is re-oxidized to (T[S] 2 ) in the process. The essential role of TR in the parasite thiol metabolism and its absence from the mammalian host render the enzyme a highly attractive target for drug development against trypanosomatids (Hamilton et al., 2003).The genus Leishmania owns three enzymes involved in the recycling of purine nucleotides by the salvage pathway. One of them, adeninephosphoribosyl transferase (APRT), is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of adenine and α-d-5phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) into adenosine-5-monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi) by anomeric inversion of the ribofuranose ring (Musick, 1981). APRT and gGAPDH enzymes reveal differences in the amino acid sequence when compared to corresponding mammalian enzymes, which should allow the development of selective inhibitor compounds.In our investigation for enzymatic inhibitors and trypanocidal agents to be used against parasitic protozoa, we have screened hexanic, methanolic, and hydroalcoholic extracts, as well as 34 isolated compounds from the aforementioned plants for their trypanocidal effects on bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei. In addition, the inhibitory activities, either on gGAPDH and TR enzymes from T. cruzi or APRT enzyme from Leishmania tarentolae, were assessed.

T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitory activityThe enzymatic activity of T. cruzi gGAPDH and the inhibitory activities of extracts and compounds against this enzyme have been determined accord-ing to an earlier reported procedure (Vieira et al., 2001). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), i. e., the concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity, was estimated from graphically plotted dose-response curves by making rate measurements for at least five inhibitor concentrations, using the nonlinear curve-fitting program SigmaPlot 2001 7.0. Statistical error limits on the IC 50 values have been calculated in amount to 10% or less. The coumarin chalepin was used as positive control (IC 50 = 55.5 μm).
L. tarentolae APRT inhibitory activityAPRT cloning, expression, and purification have been determined according to earlier described procedures (Thiemann et al., 1998). The APRT activity has been determined by spectrophotometric measurements of the formation of AMP at 259 nm after 60 s. The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1.0 mL, 0.01 mm adenine, 0.5 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl 2 , 100 mm Tris-HCl [2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol-hydrochloride], pH 7.4, and 3.8 μL APRT solution. The reaction started by the addition of enzyme. The specific activity of the enzyme and the inhibitory activity of compounds and extracts have been calculated in agreement with the literature (Vieira et al., 2001).
T. cruzi TR inhibitory activityEnzyme activity and assay were performed according to prior descriptions (Hamilton et al., 2003). Clomipramine (Novartis) was used as positive control [IC 50 = 2.72 μm (personal communication, Alan Fairlamb)]. The IC 50 value was determined by microplate assays in serial two-fold dilutions of the test compound. The data were processed using the GraFit version 4.5 Program (written by R. J. Laetherbarrow, Univ. London Imperial Coll. Sci. Technol. & Med., Dept. Chem., Biol. & Biophys. Chem. Sect., London SW7 2AZ, England) in order to obtain the IC 50 values, and the results were fitted into the equationY = {Range / [1 + (X / IC 50 ) s ]} + Background,where Y is the absorbance, X the concentration of the test compound (in μm), Range the Y axis scale, Background the zero control and s the slope factor (s = 1).
T. brucei cell culture and cytotoxicity assayBloodstream forms of T. brucei, strain 427 wild type, were grown in HMI-9 medium with 10% serum following the published protocol (Hirumi and Hirumi, 1989). The effect of compounds on the viability of bloodstream forms of T. brucei was evaluated using the Alamar Blue " assay (Räz et al., 1997). Petamidine was used as positive control (IC 50 = 14 nm). In general, compounds were tested at a concentration of 100 μm.
T. cruzi cytotoxicity assayThe assay was carried out using blood infected with trypomastigotes of T. cruzi "Y" strain collected by cardiac puncture in experimentally infected male Swiss albino mice on the parasitemic peak (seventh day) and diluted with normal murine blood to 2 • 10 6 trypomastigotes/mL. The assay was performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) containing 387.5 mL of diluted infected blood and solutions of extracts or compounds in DMSO to acquire final concentrations of 4 mg/mL, 500 μg/mL, 250 μg/mL and 100 μg/ mL. The plates were incubated at 4 ∞C, and the number of parasites counted after 24 h. Negative and positive controls containing infected blood with either 2.5% DMSO or gentian violet (IC 50 = 31 μg/mL or 76 μm) were run in parallel. The results were expressed as percentage of lysis of trypomastigote forms compared to the DMSO control. DMSO at 2.5% did not interfere with the parasite survival.
Results and Discussion
Identification of compoundsFig. 2 shows the structures of isolated and tested compounds from S. densiflora: quercetin (1); quercitrin (2); gallic acid (3); arjunolic acid (4); vanillic acid (5); sitosterol (6); syringic acid (7); 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzoic acid (8); ellagic acid (9); 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxaldehyde (10); casuarinin (11); castalagin (12); ellagic acid 4-O-α-lrhamnopyranoside (13); and from V. polygama: luteolin ( 14 I andII).
Trypanocidal activityAmong the 21 extracts and 13 partition fractions tested against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, 15 revealed significant activities (Ͼ 60%, Table III) and were considered as promising sources of active substances.Partition of VP-HL produced fractions with poorer activities (Table III). 1 H NMR analysis of    VP-HHL (53%) showed characteristic signals of hydrocarbons and fatty acids. VP-DHL (38%), when submitted to column chromatography, yielded a fraction containing a mixture of steroids which was responsible for 93% of Tc lysis at 500 μg/mL (this information is not displayed in the table). VP-EHL (36%) yielded compound 18 (31%), and VP-MHL (52%) afforded compounds 18 and 23 (16%).VP-DML, after fractionation, afforded compounds 16, 17, and a mixture of flavonoids containing quercetin 3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside and quercetin 4Ј-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, which caused 97% Tc lysis at 500 μg/L. The same mixture inhib-ited the gGAPDH activity by 92% at 100 μg/mL (this information is not displayed in the table), which may explain the mechanism of action of the mixture on the trypomastigote forms of the parasite. 16 performed a better activity against T. cruzi (33%, Table II) in comparison with compound 14 (27%), indicating that O-methylation of the 3Ј-hydroxy group was important to improve the activity.VP-BHAL showed a good trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi (60%, Table III), however, the compounds isolated from this fraction did not. Compound 33 (11%, 1.5 mm, Table II) was much less active than its aglycone tested previously (IC 50 2.1 mm, Grael et al., 2005), showing that the glycose moiety, making the molecule more polar, had a bad influence on the biological action.The polar extracts from S. densiflora (SD-HAS, SD-MT, SD-HAT, SD-MR, and SD-HAR, Table III) exhibited a strong effect on T. cruzi; on the other hand, compounds isolated from them did not (3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13; Table I). Maybe the compound(s) responsible for the original extract activity had not been identified yet. The outcomes from triterpenes 4 (Table I), 24, 25 and 26 (Table II) point out a clear correlation between increasing number of hydroxy groups and higher activity, which justifies a meticulous investigation on structure-activity relationships in this case.All the substances tested against T. brucei were inactive, perhaps because of the low concentration (100 μm) tested in contrast to the concentration tested on T. cruzi (500 μg/mL, see Tables I andII).
gGAPDH inhibitionOn the whole, 26 extracts and subfractions were tested. Eleven of them, the most polar (SD-methanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts), showed outcomes above 70% (Table III), and the majority belonged to S. densiflora (SD). The ascription of such activities to the hydrolysable tannins 11, 12, 13, and ellagic acid (9) may be considered due to the low IC 50 values accomplished by these compounds (Table I).Among the flavonoids, the simple and highly oxidized flavonol quercetin (1) was the most active. The flavone luteolin ( 14), without a hydroxy group at C-3, had a reduced performance. Though, its activity seemed to be improved by the introduction of the methoxy group at position C-3 (15) or C-3Ј ( 16), the presence of two or more methoxy groups at the flavone skeleton did significantly lower the inhibitory activity of the three tested enzymes (for comparison, see activities of compounds 17, 18 and 23 in Table II). The O-glycosylated flavonol quercitrin (2) had a minor outcome in contrast to its aglycone 1. Lio et al. (1985) observed the same behaviour with these compounds on xanthine oxidase, concluding that glycosylated derivatives are more hydrophilic and bulky, what reduces their contact with the active site of the enzyme. This observation fits with the small activities also performed by compounds 21 and 22 (Table II). The triterpenes were no efficient inhibitors of the gGAPDH enzyme neither a mixture of them (see Tables I andII). An unseparated mixture of lupeol, α-amyrin and β-amyrin, isolated from the dichloromethane layer of the methanolic extract of leaves from S. densiflora (SD-DML), tested at 200 μm, was inactive (this information is not shown in the table). At a similar concentration, a mixture of compound 24 and its isomer 2α,3β-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid, isolated from VP-DML, was also inactive, while compound 24 inhibited 44% of the enzyme activity (Table II).
APRT inhibitionFrom 17 extracts and subfractions tested, eight presented results greater than 60%. Several could not be screened because they absorbed at the same wavelength used in the bioassay. The activity of the methanolic extract from leaves of S. densiflora was increased after fractionation (from 74 to 90%, Table I). Furthermore, quercetin (1) as well as quercitrin (2), from the ethyl acetate layer (SD-EML), showed inhibitory activities similar to their original extracts (97 and 89%, respectively, Table I). Altogether, flavonoids and triterpenes had activities similar to those performed on gGAPDH (Tables I andII). When analyzing the results displayed by ecdysteroids, we can notice that their activities were strictly linked to the number of hydroxy groups. Accordingly, compound 29, bearing an extra hydroxy group in relation to 28 and two in relation to 30, was twice more active than 28 and seven times more than 30 (Table II).
TR inhibitionAll tested substances were practically inactive toward the TR enzyme except for casuarinin (11) and castalagin (12) which performed an IC 50 value of 179.3 μm on enzyme inhibition, although this result is not promising in comparison with clomipramine, the positive control.Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.
