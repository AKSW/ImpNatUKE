Um novo alcalóide benzofenantridínico, 6-acetonil-N-metil-diidrodecarina foi isolado das raízes de Zanthoxylum riedelianum juntamente com lupeol, 6-acetonildiidroqueleritrina e 6-acetonildiidroavicina. As estruturas dessas substâncias foram estabelecidas com base na análise dos dados espectrométricos de IV, EM e RMN incluindo experimentos 2D.A new benzophenanthridine alkaloid, 6-acetonyl-N-methyl-dihydrodecarine was isolated from Zanthoxylum riedelianum roots together with lupeol, 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine and 6-acetonyldihydroavicine. The structures were established from the IR, MS and NMR spectral data, including 2D-NMR experiments.

IntroductionThe Zanthoxylum genus (Rutaceae) is composed by more than 200 species and largely distributed around the world. 1 Chemically, this genus is characterized by alkaloids, 2-7 cumarins, 5,6,8 lignans, 4,9,10 amides 11,12 and terpenes. 5,6,13,14 Ongoing studies have shown that Zanthoxylum exhibit a range of biological activities such as antichagas, 2 tripanocidal, 9 antiplasmodial, 7 anti-HIV 13 and antiinflammatory, 8,10 as well as antihelmintic. 12 Z. riedelianum is used in folk medicine as a decoction against different types of inflammations, rheumatism and skin stains. 15 Previous works reported the identification of terpenes from the essential oil 14 and lignans from the leaves and the stem bark. 10 In this work we report the isolation and structural elucidation of a novel benzophenanthridine alkaloid, namely, 6-acetonyl-N-methyl-dihydrodecarine (1), together with two known alkaloids 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (2) and 6-acetonyldihydroavicine (3) from the roots of Z. riedelianum.
Experimental
General proceduresMelting points were uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on FTIR-Bomem-MB/100 model spectrophotometer using NaCl film. NMR spectra in CDCl 3 , were recorded on Bruker ARX-400 (400 MHz for 1 H and 100 MHz for 13 
Extraction and isolationDried roots (3.0 kg) were powdered and extracted with hexane and methanol by maceration at room temperature. The macerates were concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the extracts A (21.5 g) and B (200.5 g) from hexane and methanol, respectively. The extract A was partitioned with hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol. Solvents were removed under reduced pressure and the dichloromethane residue (8.2 g) was submitted to column chromatography, carried out in a gradient system from hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol as mobile phase. The 174 collected fractions were reunited in 30 fractions. Fraction 10 (1.0 g) afforded the triterpene lupeol (170.0 mg, mp 162.5-164.2 °C). Fraction 25 (200.0 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC with dichloromethane-methanol (2:8), affording the alkaloid 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (2, 30.0 mg, mp 171.6-173.0 °C).The extract B was partitioned successively with hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol. The dichloromethane residue (530.0 mg) was submitted to column chromatography performed in a gradient system with hexane, dichloromethane, acetone and methanol as mobile phase. The 243 collected fractions were reunited in 33 fractions after TLC comparison. Fraction 4 (190.0 mg) was submitted to preparative TLC eluting with dichloromethane-methanol (1:9), affording the alkaloids 6-acetonyl-N-methyl-dihydrodecarine (1, 60.0 mg, mp 186-188 °C) and 6-acetonyldihydroavicine (3, 57.0 mg, mp 184-185 °C).

Results and DiscussionThe well known natural compounds lupeol, 16 6-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (2) 17 and 6-acetonyldihydroavicine (3) 18 were identified mainly by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral analyses, comparing with previous literature data. [16][17][18] Compound 1 presented a positive test with Dragendorff´s reagent, indicating it to be an alkaloid. The IR spectrum presented bands at 3396 (ν OH ), 1708 (ν C=O ) , 1615, 1516 cm -1 attributed to aromatic rings. The positive ESImass spectrum of 1 showed a quasi-molecular ion at m/z 391 [M+H] + pointing out to a molecular formula C 23 H 21 NO 5 . The 1 H NMR spectrum of 1, exhibited signals corresponding to six aromatic hydrogen, characteristic of a benzophenanthridine system. 18 Accordingly, the aromatic region from compound (1) 1 H NMR spectrum exhibited signals of two pairs of one-hydrogen doublets (d Η 7.01 (H-9) and 7.54 (H-10); 7.72 (H-11) and 7.51 (H-12)) and two one-hydrogen singlets (d Η 7.10 (H-1) and 7.51 (H-4)) indicating the presence of four aromatic hydrogens in ortho position and two isolated hydrogens. The 1 H NMR spectrum also displayed signals of methylenedioxide group at d Η 6.05 (2H, AB system), hydroxyl group at d Η 5.30 (s, 1H), a methoxyl group at d Η 3.95 (s, 3H) and the N-methyl group at d Η 2.65 (s, 3H). In addition to the benzophenanthridine signals, the presence of an acetonyl group at C-6 was indicated by a methyl singlet at d Η 2.02 and the AMX system with d Η 2.25 (J 3.5 and 15.2 Hz) and 2.66 (J 10.9 and 15.2 Hz), respectively, and d Η 5.0 (J 3.5 and 10.9 Hz), corresponding to the coupling constants between H-6 and the acetonyl methylene hydrogens in the 1 H NMR and 1 H, 1 H-COSY spectra. The 13 C NMR spectrum also confirmed the acetonyl moiety with signals at 207.6 (C=O), 31.5 (COCH 3 ), 46.5 (-CH 2 CO). Through the chemical shifts observed in the 13 C, 1 H-gHSQC spectrum, it was possible the attribution of each carbon and its respective hydrogen (Table 1 = 54.9-60.2 = -5.3 ppm as γ effect. Therefore, the structure of 1 was established as 6-acetonyl-N-methyldihydrodecarine, a decarine derivative. 18 Previous publications, 17,18 however, reported the isolation of the unstable parent alkaloids avicine and nitidine. Although acetone derivatives of avicine and nitidine have been reported in the literature, [19][20][21] as well as acetone aducts of two other benzophenantridine alkaloids, 22,23 it is controversial, however, whether those acetone derivatives are really present on the plant extract or were isolated as artifacts, due to the greater stability of the acetone aducts as compared to the parent alkaloids avicine and nitidine.

CH 3 (d Η 2.65) with C-6 (d C 54.8). The absence of the methoxyl group in C-7 moves away the effect of the oxygen atom in C-6, justifying its largest chemical shift (d C 60.2) in compound 3, when compared with the correspondent d C 54.8, attributed to C-6 in compound 1; thus revealing ∆ C). Thecross peaks observed in the HMBC spectrum showed long-range couplings from H-6 (d Η 5.0) and H-3' (d Η 2.02) withC-2' (d C 207.6), confirming the connection of the acetonylmoiety with C-6. Further correlations were observedbetween OCH 3 (d Η 3.95) with C-7 (d C 151.3), as well as H-9(d Η 7.01) and H-10 (d Η 7.54) with C-8 (d C 144.9) and C-10(d C 119.7), indicating that position 8 is substituted; finally,N-
