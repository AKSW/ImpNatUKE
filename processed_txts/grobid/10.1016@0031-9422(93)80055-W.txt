3-METHOXYFUROCOUMARINS FROM PILOCARPUS RIEDELIANUS
INTRODUCTIONThe genus Pilocarpus has long been known as the most important source of the alkaloid pilocarpine, a useful medicine for the treatment of glaucoma and other diseases [1]. Recent reports reveal the presence of aliphatic ketones, pilocarpamide and (-)-episesamine in P. trachyllopus [2], dammarane triterpenes in P. spicatus [3] and coumarins in P. goudotianus [4].In this paper, we report the isolation and structural elucidation of the new coumarins 3-methoxyangelicin (1) and 3,6-dimethoxyangelicin (2) in addition to the known sphondin, pimpinellin, scopoletin, aurapten, osthol and meranzin hydrate from a dichloromethane extract of the stems of P. riedelianus. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectral data.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCompound 1 gave a blue fluorescent spot on TLC. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of five resonances, corresponding to five protons, in the aromatic region (t56.9-7.7) besides a singlet (63.92) for the three protons typical of a methoxyl group. The ~ 3C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of 12 signals.These data, together with the [M] ÷ (m/z 216), 5157.7 (13CNMR) and 1727 cm -1 (IR) suggested a coumarin with the molecular formula C ~ 2HsO4. Further analysis of the 1HNMR for 1 showed signals characteristic of a disubstituted furan ring, an AB coupling system (J = 8.9 Hz) and a singlet. These data together with the long-range coupling observed between H-Y and H-6 allowed us to propose an angular arrangement for the *Permanent address: Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal do Parfi, Campus Universitfirio, Guamfi, 66030 Bel6m, PA, Brazil.Based on part of the Ph.D. thesis that will be presented by A.H.M. to the Universidade Federal de $5o Carlos.

R-OMeShort Reports furan ring [5]. On the other hand, the absence of a pair of doublets characteristic of H-3 and H-4 indicated that either H-3 or H-4 is substituted. This is in agreement with the placement of the methoxyl in one of those positions. The placement of the methoxyl at C-3 was revealed by NOE experiments where irradiation of either H-5 or the methoxyl caused an effect in the signal (66.95). This experiment also led unequivocally to the assignment of H-4 to the signal at 66.95.Through several experiments such as DEPT and ~H-~3C COSY it was also possible to assign the carbons in the ~3C NMR. The other resonances were assigned through comparison with model compounds I-6, 7-1. All the evidence above is in agreement with the structure of 3methoxyangelicin for 1.The I H NMR spectrum of 2 (Table 1), together with the I-M] ÷ (m/z 246) suggested that this compound was a 3methoxyangelicin derivative. The placement of the additional methoxyl group (64.07) at C-6 was confirmed by both NOE experiments and the absence of long-range coupling between H-3' and the benzene protons. This evidence supports the structure of 3,6-dimethoxyangelicin for 2.The known coumarins were identified by comparison of their spectral data with those reported in the literature [8][9][10][11][12][13]. Coumarins are widely distributed in plant species, but the occurrence of 3-methoxycoumarins in the Rutaceae has not been reported previously.
EXPERIMENTALGeneral. UV and IR were recorded in MeOH and CHCI3, respectively. 1H and ~3CNMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, in CDCI 3 with TMS as int. standard. MS were obtained at 70 eV (probe).Plant material. Pilocarpus riedelianus was collected in the State of Esplrito Santo, Brazil, in June 1986. A voucher specimen is deposited at Herbarium of the Instituto de BiociSncias da Universidade de Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.Extraction and isolation. Stems (750 g) were ground and extracted with hexane, CH2C12 and MeOH, respectively. The CH2C12 extract (8.8 g) was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using hexane, CH2C12, EtOAc and MeOH as eluents. The EtOAc fr. (6.9 g) subjected to CC over silica gel using hexane, CH2C12, EtOAc and MeOH at different ratios of increasing polarity, furnished 22 frs. Fr. 12 was purified by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexane-EtOAc, 4: 1) to yield aurapten (12 mg) and osthol (8 mg). Frs 13 and 14 were submitted to CC over silica gel eluting with hexane-Me2CO (9: 1) affording 1 (8 mg). Fr. 16 after CC over silica gel eluting with CH2CI2-MeOH (19:1) afforded 45 new frs. Fr. 16/I was purified by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexane-Me2CO, 7:3) to yield sphondin (9 mg) and pimpinellin (8 mg Table I .IIH and 13CNMR data for compounds 1 and 1H for 212H/CHCH2--157.7 s--3--143.0 s*--46.95s113.9d6.90s4a--116.5 s--57.29 d122.4 d6.75 s(8.9)67.41 dd108.9 d--(8.9/0.8)7--155.3 s--8--113.8 s--8a--143.1 s*--2'7.65 d147.7 d7.73 d(2.2)(2.2)Y7.05 dd103.7 d7.07 d(2.2/0.8)(2.2)OMe-33,98 s56.2 t3.95 sOMe-6 ----4.07s*Assignments may be reversed.Values in parentheses are coupling con-stants in Hz.
