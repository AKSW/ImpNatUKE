The crude extract (6.0 g) was chromatographed on Si gel (120 g), and the CHCI, eluate gave a solid that partly crystallized.'May be interchanged.Bauerenone.-Bauerenol (20 mg) was oxidized with Jones reagent at room temperature for 15 min to yield a ketone. Recrystallization of the ketone (12 mg) from CHCI, gave a product which showed ir and mass spectra identical with those described in the literature for bauerenone (4-6). 1were assigned by comparison with 0.85 (s, C-28 methyl) and 0.78 (s.
