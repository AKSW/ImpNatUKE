LIMONOIDS FROM SEEDS OF TOONA CILIA TA AND THEIR CHEMOSYSTEMATIC SIGNIFICANCE
From the seeds of Toona ciliata were isolated, besides toonacilin, two novel limonoids: 12-deacetoxytoonacilin and 6~-acetoxy-14fl,15fl-epoxyazadirone. These results do not seem to support the affiliation of Toona to the Swietenioideae.

INTRODUCTIONToona was originally described by Endlicher (1840) as a section of Cedrela [11. However, Roemer later (1846) recognized that they could be separated by a number of sound morphological characters, raising Toona to generic rank and most monographers have followed this lead [11. Thus, the old world species of Cedrela were transferred to Toona (Endlicher) M. J. Roemer. The two genera were placed by Harms (1940) in the tribe Cedreleae under Cedreloideae [21. Pennington and Styles, in their more recent monograph, include the Cedreleae in the Swietenioideae [3].As reported in previous papers [4, 51 genera of Swietenioideae explore limonoid chemistry along only one route which leads to the mexicanolide group. In contrast, genera of Melioideae should form the more primitive taxon, split off from the common ancestral lineage before synthesis of the mexicanolide types. The ring B-seco limonoids then persisted into the Melioideae with development of the ring C-seco limonoids. The known limonoids from Cedrela are typical of the Swietenioideae [4, 51. On the other hand, Toona appear to be peripheral Melioideae as well as Swietenioideae [4,5].Recently, we have described the isolation and identification of two novel meliacin butenolides, 21-hydroxycedrelonelide and 23-hydroxy-cedrelonelide from the stem of T. ciliata [6]. These limonoids are very closely related to those isolated from the melioid genus Trichilia [7, 81, showing that the affiliation of Toona to the Swietenioideae is still rather problematic. Clearly much more *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. detailed phytochemical investigations of Toona species will be essential for a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Meliaceae.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe dichloromethane extract from the seeds of T. ciliata, afforded three typically Meliaceous limonoids. The limonoid I showed all the spectral data (Tables 1 and2) of toonacilin which have previously been isolated from the bark of T. ciliata [9, 101. Toonacilin can assume any of several rotations, although the rotamer I appears to be sterically the most favourable, since very strong correlations between H-5 and H-11, and between Me-19 and H-30b were revealed from NOESY experiments (Table 3). Moreover, there was a strong correlation between H-9 and H-30b.The limonoid 2 showed spectral data (Tables 1 and21 suggestive of a structure similar to toonacilin, but having only one ct-acetoxyl substituent in ring C (3 5.23 br s, 70.9). The tH-1H COSY spectrum revealed the oxymethine proton to be coupled only to the tH signal at tS1.89 (H-12). The signal for H-9 was still visible as a broad single! at t52.46 as in l, so placing the ~-acetoxyl substituent at C-11. This was supported by the NOESY spectrum which showed a very strong correlation between H-11 and H-. ~ (Table 3). The correlations between H-30b and H-9, and between H-30a and H-15 confirm their assignments and are consistent with the stereochemistry as in 2 (ct-H at C -c and ~t-H at C-15). A 1H-13CCOSY experimenl permitted the assignments of all the protonated carbon, including the tertiary methyl groups. The quaternar 3 carbons were assigned on the basis of the 1H-t3C lon$ range correlations listed in Table 4. Thus, the observec  correlation between the Me-18 at 60.70 and the laC signal at t~40.9 (2j) led unequivocally to the assignment of C-13 to this signal, but not of C-10. The new natural product is, therefore, 12-deacetoxytoonacilin (2). Compound 3 exhibited similar spectral data to surenin (4), which has previously been isolated from the leaves of Toona sureni (Blume) Merill [11]. The 13CNMR spectrum (Table 2) showed signals at 6157.6 (C-l), 126.1 (C-2) and 204.6 (C-3), characteristic era ring A 1-en-3-one, as in the model compound 5 [12], instead of an ~t,flunsaturated 6-1actone. Moreover, the chemical shifts of the ring B-D carbons were comparable with those reported for surenin (Table 2). From several 2D experiments it was possible to assign the chemical shifts for many protons and all carbons in the molecule (Tables 1 and2). The assignment of the stereochemistry of the acetoxy groups received further support from NOESY experiments which showed very strong correlations of H-6 and H-7 with Me-30, and H-6 with Me-29. The new natural product is, therefore, 6~t-acetoxy-14fl, 15fl-epoxyazadirone.The chemical evidence to hand strongly supports Roemer's taxonomic conclusions. However, limonoids (ring B-seco) of Toona can be considered to be biogenetic precursors of the mexicanolide types which are common in Cedrela, suggesting a direct derivation of this latter from Toona-like ancestors. Isolation of constituents. Toona ciliata was collected in Viqosa, MG, Brazil, and a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of Departamento de Engenharia Florestai, Universidade Federal de Vi¢osa, Vigosa, MG. The seeds were dried, powdered and extracted with hexane, CH2CI 2 and MeOH. The CH2Clz extract (77.5 g) was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using hexane, hexane-CH2Cl 2 (1 : 1), CH2CI 2, CH2CI2-EtOAc (1 : 1), EtOAc and MeOH. The CHzCI2-EtOAc fr. was chromatographed on a DCCC (hexane-EtOH-EtOAc-H20, 5: 4: 2: 1, ascending method). The organic fr. yielded a ppt. of 1 (150 rag) and 2 (90 mg) which was purified by 2 prep. TLC (silica gel, hexane-CH2CI2-MeOH, 12.5:12.5:0.5; silica gel, hexane-EtOAc-MeOH, 20:5:0.5). The remaining organic fr. was rechromatographed over silica gel using hexane-CH2Cl 2 (1:1), CH2Clz, EtOAc and MeOH at different ratios of increasing polarity, yielding 25 frs. Frs 8-12 were purified by prep. TLC (silica gel, bexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 12.5:12.5:0.5) to yield a new ft. containing 3 (20 mg). The latter was then repurified by prep. TLC (silica gel, bexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 20:5: 0.5).Toonacilin (1).
