Antifungal metabolites from Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, an endophytic fungus in Cryptocarya mandioccana Nees (Lauraceae)
Subject and sourceIn the course of our continuous search for bioactive compounds from endophytic fungi living in plants from Cerrado and Atlantic Forest (Cafe ˆu et al., 2005;Teles et al., 2005;Silva et al., 2005), healthy leaves of Cryptocarya mandioccana were submitted to isolation of endophytes and 15 strains were isolated. Among them Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz) Penz & Sacc., was selected for chemical and biological investigation because of the strong antifungal activity of the crude EtOAc extract against the phytopathogenic fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides and Cladosporium sphaerospermum.C. gloeosporioides was identified by Dr. Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited in the fungal herbarium of the Universidade Federal de Lavras (CML 737).
Previous workColletotrichum spp. have been reported as endophytes of some plants. Aspergillomarasmin B (Ballio et al., 1969), aspergillomarasmine A (Bousquet et al., 1971), gloeosporone (Meyer et al., 1987), ferricrocin (Ohra et al., 1995), diketopiperazines (Trigos et al., 1997), polysaccharides (Park et al., 2001) and colletotric acid, 3b,5a,6b-trihydroxyergosta-7,22-diene, uracil and lumichrome (Zou et al., 2000) have been isolated from C. gloeosporioides.
Present studyC. gloeosporioides was subcultured in Petri plates containing PDA and incubated for seven days. After this period, it was inoculated at 25e28 C in 20 Â 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 200 mL of Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB). The cultures were incubated at 25 C and aerated by agitation on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 28 days. The filtered fermentation broth (ca. 4.0 L) was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 Â 1.5 L); the organic phase was dried with MgSO 4 and concentrated to yield 195.3 mg of crude extract.The crude extract was cleaned-up in reversed-phase silica gel (C-18) using MeOH as eluent and subsequently purified by reversed-phase preparation HPLC [C-18 column e Phenomenex-Luna (210 Â 21.2 mm), l ¼ 254 nm, 10.0 mL/min, H 2 O:MeOH (75:25) to MeOH (100%) over 120 min], affording (À) cis-4-hydroxy-6-deoxyscytalone (1) [22.8 mg, t R ¼ 25 min, a D 25 À133 (ca. 0.024, CHCl 3 )] and (4R)-4,8-dihydroxy-a-tetralone (2) [10.1 mg, t R ¼ 60 min, a D 25 À17.7 (ca. 0.018, CHCl 3 )]. The chemical structure of these compounds was elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR and MS spectral data and by comparison with those reported in the literature (Venkatasubbaiah and Chilton, 1992;Krohn et al., 2002;Aldridge et al., 1974;Kokubun et al., 2003;Machida et al., 2005).The antifungal activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Rahalison et al., 1991). The detection limit of these compounds required to inhibit growth of the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum was 5.0 mg, comparable with the positive control nystatin. 
Ecological significanceThe strong antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum of the compounds 1 and 2 suggests that the endophytic fungi C. gloeosporioides in C. mandioccana could protect the host by producing metabolites, which may be toxic or even lethal to phytopathogens, and highlights the potential of endophytic fungi in producing bioactive metabolites.To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. gloeosporioides as an endophytic fungus inhabiting plants from Brazilian Atlantic Forest and C. mandioccana.
