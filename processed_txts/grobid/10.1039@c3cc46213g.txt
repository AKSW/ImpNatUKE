Biosynthetic pathway of sesquiterpene lactones in Smallanthus sonchifolius and their localization in leaf tissues by MALDI imaging
The biosynthetic route for epoxyangelate esters of the sesquiterpene lactones (STL) uvedalin and enhydrin from in vitro cultures of Smallanthus sonchifolius (Asteraceae) was investigated with 13 Cprecursors for the first time in the literature. Photomicroscope analyses and studies using MALDI-MS imaging confirmed that glandular trichomes accumulate STL.

Smallanthus sonchifolius (Poepp & Endl.) H. Robinson (Asteraceae) is popularly known as yac√≥n and has attracted worldwide attention because of its wide range of medicinal and nutritional properties, 1 despite its reported renal toxicity. 2 The melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones (STL) uvedalin (1) and enhydrin (2) are the major constituents of the S. sonchifolius leaves. Enhydrin (2) has been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory, 3 antimicrobial, 4,5 and anti-diabetic activities. 6 There is a significant amount of information on the structural aspects of such STL 7 and on their biological activities, but few 20 studies about STL biosynthesis. Only two feeding experiments have been reported for the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways of STL in Asteraceae. In both studies, each plant produced STL via different terpene pathways. 8,9 Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) are the universal precursors in the biosynthesis of terpenoids. The biosynthesis of IPP can proceed via two different pathways in plants: mevalonate (MVA) and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4phosphate (MEP) pathways. 10 Despite a significant amount of recent research in this area, primarily on the establishment of the MVA and MEP chemical reactions, 11 knowledge pertaining to the contribution of both pathways in the biosynthesis of different plant terpenoids remains limited.We report herein the complete elucidation of STL 1 and 2 biosynthetic pathway from Smallanthus sonchifolius using 1-13 C-D-glucose, 1,2-13 C 2 -mevalonolactone, 2-13 C-sodium acetate and L-[U-13 C 6 ]-isoleucine as precursors. Nodal segments of S. sonchifolius were sterilized and inoculated on solid and liquid Murashige & Skoog media 12 supplemented with the precursors described above and allowed to grow aseptically until the appropriate establishment of plantlets had formed.First of all, segments of S. sonchifolius were sterilized and inoculated on solid Murashige & Skoog medium 12 supplemented with 1-13 C-D-glucose. An acetone extract from fresh shoots of S. sonchifolius was prepared after eight weeks of culture and fractioned via column chromatography and HPLC to yield 1 and 2. The patterns of incorporation of labeled substrates were determined by quantitative 13 C NMR by comparing the relative intensities of the labeled and non-labeled STL signals for 1 and 2. The 13 C enrichment patterns of 1 and 2, after 1-13 C-D-glucose metabolism (Fig. 1), indicated that the three isoprene building blocks were predominantly formed via the MEP pathway in the  Aliphatic esters of angelic, tiglic, isovaleric, and isobutyric acids 75 are believed to be products of the metabolism of the amino acids L-isoleucine, L-leucine, and L-valine. 13 In most biosynthetic studies, especially concerning Datura meteloides Dunal (Solanaceae), L-[U-14 C]-isoleucine is the precursor of tiglic acid. 14 The biosynthesis of acyl side chains from amino acids has 80 also been reported in plants from different families; 15 however, neither studies on Asteraceae species nor studies using 13 Clabeled precursors to establish the acyl side chain origin have been reported so far. Two unsuccessful biosynthetic experiments performed by our 85 research group with plantlets of S. sonchifolius suggested that 1 and 2 are biosynthesized and accumulate during the early stages of leaf development. To investigate the possibility of L-isoleucine as a precursor of the epoxyangelate esters in 1 and 2, shoots of S. sonchifolius were cultured in liquid MS medium supplemented 90 with L-[U-13 C 6 ]-isoleucine, 1,2-13 C 2 -mevalonolactone, 2-13 C-sodium acetate and 1-13 C-D-glucose. . After nine weeks of culture, an acetone extract from fresh shoots of S. sonchifolius was prepared and fractioned as described above to yield 1 and 2. The 13 C enrichment patterns of 1 and 2, after feeding with 1,2-13 C 2mevalonolactone, showed that there was no incorporation of 1,2-  17 These results suggest that epoxidation might occur at the final steps of biosynthesis. Finally, the complete biosynthesis involves first sesquiterpene skeleton synthesis, followed by the acylation by the angelic acid moiety (derived from L-isoleucine) at C-8 of STL scaffolds (derived 45 from MEP pathway) and further oxidations.It has been reported that STL are produced and accumulated in glandular trichomes from leaves and are important chemotaxonomic markers of the Asteraceae in several species. 18 A further expansion of the glandular trichomes was observed 50 microscopically; in vitro, the plant possesses the same glandular trichomes as a cultivated plant. MALDI (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization) imaging procedures have the potential to provide new insights of proteins and drugs within animal tissues. 19 MALDI imaging has been applied to analyze plant 55 tissues, but this remains an underexplored area. 20 Generally, it has been used on intact surfaces, such as leaves and petals; 20 however, the laser can penetrate deeply and several layers of cells can be analyzed. Intact (abaxial and adaxial surfaces) and transversal sections of leaves from in vitro S. sonchifolius were 60 analyzed by MALDI imaging to examine the tissue distributions of STL, mainly compounds 1 and 2. The images from leaves of S. sonchifolius, cultivated in vitro, were performed by MALDI in positive mode acquiring MS and MS/MS data. On the intact surfaces of leaves, the reconstructed images of adaxial and 65 abaxial sides for uvedalin and enhydrin (m/z 471 [M+Na] + and 487 [M+Na] + , respectively) are shown in Fig. 2 (B,C), which represent a part of leaf intact surface. Higher amounts of these compounds were observed in the abaxial surface and its foliar periphery. In the transversal section, the ions of 1 and 2 were 70 observed in glandular trichomes (Fig. 2E-F) by MS mode. The analyses were carried out in the whole surfaces of transversal sections, and some parts were expanded for visualization (Fig. 2-D). This trichome type was previously reported from leaves of S. sonchifolius in adaxial and abaxial surfaces.   2) in transversal sections, respectively. They confirm the presence of enhydrin and uvedalin in glandular trichomes using a more reliable method, MS/MS mode. These images constructed with 95 the fragment ions demostrate the same distribution for enhydrin and uvedalin. Although STL have been reported in glandular trichomes, 22 we confirmed the presence of such compounds in glandular trichomes without doubts using MALDI Imaging technique. 100
ConclusionsIn conclusion, our studies on the biosynthesis of 1 and 2 have shown that the sesquiterpene skeleton is derived from the MEP pathway. We have also established the L-isoleucine origin of the ester side chain in the sesquiterpene lactones. These results 105 showed the involvement of both the amino acid and MEP pathways in a mixed sesquiterpene biosynthesis. In plants, synthesis of terpenoids is thought to be compartmentalized in such a way that mono-and diterpenes (also carotenoids and chlorophylls) are produced via the MEP pathway in the plastids, whereas sesquiterpenes and triterpenes are made in the cytosol via the MVA pathway. 23 However, others have reported sesquiterpenoids biosynthesized by the MEP pathway. 24 Our results, together with previously reported data, seem to suggest that plants do not synthesize sesquiterpenes exclusively in the cytoplasm. 25 It is possible that there are two cellular compartments involved into STL biosynthesis: the formation of the sesquiterpene (MEP pathway) and isoleucine (amino acid metabolism) occurs in plastids, and the formation of intermediate oxaloacetate by the TCA occurs in the mitochondria. This is the first report of a biosynthetic study of STL from S. sonchifolius and the experiments also allowed us to establish the biosynthetic pathway for epoxyangelate esters with 13 C-precursors for the first time in the literature.the studies performed at the INCT-INBEQMeDI and the CEPID-CIBFar.

Notes and referencesSTL framework. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 13 C-labeled 1 revealed enhancement of the signals at C-2 and C-14; C-8 and C-13; and C-6 and C-15, thus indicating incorporation of label into 55 the corresponding C-1 and C-5 of IPP derived from the MEP pathway as shown in Fig. 1. The 13 C NMR spectrum of labeled 2 presented a similar enrichment pattern for the corresponding carbon atoms from the sesquiterpene.

5 13 C 2 - 20 and 252202mevalonolactone in the biosynthesis of 1 and 2. This result confirms the strong evidence that MEP is the single pathway involved in sesquiterpene skeleton synthesis. Administering L-[U-13 C 6 ]-isoleucine thus resulted in multiplet signs at positions 1', 2', 3', 4' and 5' of epoxyangelate moieties from 1 and 2, 10 therefore indicating operation of the amino acid on arrangement of branched-chain ester. The remarkable multiplet signs observed arise from couplings between 13 C and 13 C directly attached to each other at the acyl side chain. Synthesis of L-isoleucine from 1-13 C-D-glucose resulted in 15 labeling pattern at positions 1', 3', 4' and 5' of epoxyangelate moieties from 1 and 2. Isotopic labeling from 2-13 C-sodium acetate experiments led to enrichment at positions 1', 3' and 4' of epoxyangelate moieties from 1 and 2. Interestingly, the C-5' did not exhibit isotopic enrichment in the branched-chain ester of 1 from 2-13 C-sodium acetate metabolism. Oxaloacetate (via the tricarboxylic acid cycle), aspartate, threonine and glutamate are key intermediates of L-isoleucine biosynthesis. Pyruvate would be enriched from 1-13 C-D-glucose metabolism, but not enriched from 2-13 C-sodium acetate pathway. 16 25 These results obtained from 13 C-precursor feeding experiments explained why no isotopic enrichment at position C-5' was observed in the branched-chain ester after 2-13 C-sodium acetate was administered to S. sonchifolius. Furthermore, 2-13 Csodium acetate has not been incorporated into the sesquiterpene 30 scaffolds, providing additional evidence for exclusive MEP pathway involvement. Moreover, the biosynthetic intermediates involved in sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis were monitored by LC-HRESIMS in the crude extract of leaves from S. sonchifolius. LC-HRESIMS analysis detected intermediates a 35 (m/z 433.1854 [M+H] + ) and b (m/z 449.1804 [M+H] + ), suggesting that the epoxidation occurs in the final steps of compound 2 biosynthesis.These results are in agreement with literature data, because STL with branched-chain esters derived from angelic and tiglic acids without epoxidation have been also 40 isolated from S. sonchifolius.
