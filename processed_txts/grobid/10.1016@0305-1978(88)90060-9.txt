The Chemosystematics of Dictyoloma
The fruit and stem of DicWoloma vandellianum have yielded three limonoids and a mixture of two alkaloids. The limonoids were identified as deacetylspathelin and the corresponding 21-and 23-'y-hydrexybutenolide derivatives. The limonoids were isolated from the fruits and stem, while the alkaloids were found only in the stem. These results provide firm support for including the genus Dictyoloma in the Rutaceae,

IntroductionDictyoloma Juss. contains only two species, D. vandellianum Adr. Juss. (syn. D. incanescens DC) which occurs in Brazil and D, peruvianum which occurs in Peru [1][2][3].The taxonomy of this genus has been doubtful since its initial description in 1825, when Jussieu [4] classified it in the Rutaceae, assigning it to the tribe Zanthoxyleae. However, at the same time De Candolle [5] classified it as an ill-defined genus in the Terebinthaceae "ordo" (equivalent to the modern description of the Terebinthaceae).According to the concept of Bentham and Hooker [6], Dictyoloma belongs to the Simaroubaceae "ordo". Engler [1] first included Dictyo-Ioma in the Simaroubaceae, but later removed it to the Rutaceae, classifying Dictyoloma as the single genus in the subfamily Dictyolomatoideae [2].One simple amine [7] and two chromones [8,9] have previously been isolated from Dictyoloma. In this paper we report a phytochemical study on D. vandellianurn, which grows in S~o Paulo state, Brazil and discuss its chemotaxonomic position in the Rutales in the light of our findings.
Results and Discussion
Isolabon and identificabon of compoundsThe chloroform extract of the fruits yielded, on chromatography over silica gel, three limonoids,(Received 22 January 1988)sitosterol and triglycerides. The corresponding extract from the stems yielded the same limonoids and two alkaloids.The major limonoid was identified as deacethylspathelin (1) and was transformed into spathelin (la) when treated with acetic anhydride and pyridine. The 1H NMR spectra of 1 and la were obtained (Table 1) and revealed the anticipated chemical shifts and coupling constants. Of particular note was the upfield shift of 0.35 ppm for H-15 on acetylation, which suggests that H-15 has a cis relationship with H-7 [10,11].Treatment of I with a basic solution of NaOH gave the acid 2 which upon reaction with diazomethane, yielded the corresponding methyl ester 2a. The structure of 2a was established by 1H NMR (Table 1), the doublet for H-1 in 1 being replaced by a triplet observed at ~) 3.90. A similar result was obtained by Taylor [12] when spathelin was treated under the same conditions, but the product reported by Taylor was epimeric at C-1.Treatment of 1 under acidic conditions using TsOH with MeOH as solvent, gave an interesting product characterized as the ortho ester 3. The comparison of the 1H NMR spectra obtained for 1 and 3 (Table 1) shows a shielding of the pair of doublets observed for H-1 and H-2 indicating the absence of an 0~,J]-unsaturated ester unit. Similarly there is an upfield shift shown for the methoxy protons. In the IR spectrum of 3 there are only two bands in the carbonyl region at 1740 and 1720 cm -~. When 3 was submitted to catalytic hydrogenation, there was reduction of  Two further limonoids 4 and 5 were isolated. Their spectral characteristics were close to those of 1 (Table 1). The principal change observed in the 1H NMR of 4 and 5 was the absence of the furan unit, which was substituted by a ~'hydroxybutyrolactone. For compound 4 this unit is characterized by the signals in the 1H NMR at ~ 7.41 referring to H-22 and ~ 6.10 for H-23. However for 5 there is a signal at ~ 6.02, instead of ~ 7.41.The analysis of the mass spectrum of 4 and 5 reveals an increment of 32 MU in relation to 1, suggesting the presence of two more oxygen atoms, which confirms their hydroxy-butenolide nature. When 4 and 5 were acetylated, the product obtained exhibited two different signals for the acetyl groups, indicating two hydroxy groups in the starting compounds 4 and 5. This fact is definitive proof that one hydroxy group is located at C-7 and the other at the butyrolactone moiety.The transformation of 1 into a mixture of 4 and 5 was carried out by means of a photooxidation reaction. The alkaloids 4,7,8-trimethoxy-l-methyl-2quinolone (6) and casimiroine (7), previously isolated from two species of Rutaceae, Spathelia sorbifolia [13] and Casimiroa edulis [14], respectively, were characterized by the co-identity of spectral and physical data with that published.
ConclusionThe alkaloids and limonoids that we have isolated from D. vandellianum are typical of the Rutaceae family [15, 16], while the two chromones 8 and 9 described recently for the same species are know to occur sporadically in the Rutaceae and allied families [17]. All these compounds are particularly closely related to those isolated from S. sorbifolia, and this is evidence of the chemical affinity between the subfamilies Spathelioideae and Dictyolomatoideae.Spathelioideae is a small subfamily of the Rutaceae [2] and it was also previously placed in the Simaroubaceae [6]. However, the presence of limonoids and anthranilic acid derivatives alkaloids (specifically 6) was the reason used by Adams [18] to retain Spathelioideae in the Rutaceae.Based on the above evidence, we are suggesting that D. vandellianum certainly belongs to the Rutaceae, which is in agreement with the most recent proposition of Engler [2].

The fruits (700 g) were dried and extracted with CHCl 3 and MeOH. The CHCl3 extract (20 g) was chromatographed over Si gel (dry column, 200 g). The column was eluted with CH2CI = and subsequently fractionated into 13 parts. Fractions 6, 7 and 8 gave 800 mg of the limonoid 1 and a mixture of 4 and 5 (150 mg).The extract obtained from the stems (3 g) after extraction with CHCI~, was chromatogrephed on dry column over Si gel (50 g) deactivated with 10% of water, and using CH2CI=:EtOAc (9:1) for elution.
