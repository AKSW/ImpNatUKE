ACETYLATED DNA-DAMAGING CLERODANE DITERPENES FROM CASEARIA SYLVESTRIS*
AbstractÐIn addition to the known diterpene casearin G (1), two new clerodane diterpene casearins type, casearin S (2) and casearin T (3), were isolated from an acetylated bioactive CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH extract from leaves of Casearia sylvestris. The diterpenes 1±3 exhibited moderate but selective activity towards the DNA-repair de®cient yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants RAD 52YK and RS 321. The structures of 1±3 were established on the basis of NMR spectroscopic experiments

INTRODUCTIONAs a part of our ongoing search for natural product-based anticancer agents from Brazilian plant species [1±3], we have screened the CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (2:1, v/v) extract obtained from the leaves of Casearia sylvestris SW (Flacourtiaceae). The genus Casearia, with about 1000 described species [4], has not been subjected to extensive investigations [5±9]. C. sylvestris is reported to be a source of casearins, diterpenes known to have cytotoxic activity against V-79 cells [9±11]. Bioactivity-directed fractionation of an extract of leaves of C. sylvestris, collected in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, led to the isolation of the known clerodane diterpene, casearin G (1), and the two new clerodane diterpenes, casearin S (2) and T (3), as the main components responsible for the DNA-damaging activity of this extract. This is the ®rst report of the DNA-modifying activity of clerodane diterpenes.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA preliminary investigation of the bioactive CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (2:1) extract of the leaves of C. sylvestris indicated that its bioactivity was due to diterpene components. The resulting fractions exhibiting bioactivity were further separated by silica gel CC and prep. TLC to aord ®ve bioactive fractions containing oxygenated diterpenes as their main constituents. A small amount of each fraction was acetylated in order to improve the process of puri®cation and also to assure that the acetylated products maintained their bioactivities. As the acetylated fractions remained active, the non-acetylated mixtures were subjected to acetylation followed by the usual puri®cation to yield three acetylated bioactive clerodane diterpenes, named casearins G, S and T. Casearin G (1) is a known compound previously isolated from the same source [11], while casearins S (2) and T (3) are new bioactive diterpenes. Their structures were con®rmed by extensive spectroscopic studies and comparison of their spectra with those in the literature for related casearins [8±11].Casearin S (2), C 27 H 38 O 7 (EIMS), [a] D +18.08, exhibited 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral data very similar to those observed for casearin G [11] (Tables 1 and2). However, the triplet attributed to H-18 at d 6.67 (J = 1.5 Hz) in the low ®eld region of the 1 H NMR spectrum of 1 was absent in diterpene 2. The other signals attributed to H-2, H-7, H-12, H-14, H-15 and H-19 were almost superimposable, when compared with 1, indicating that the only modi®cation in the structure of 2 was related to C-18. In fact, the 13 C NMR spectrum of 2 (Table 2) resembled that of casearin G, with the major dierences being due to the lack of the signal at d 94.5 (d) attributed to C-18, and the presence of an additional signal at d 172.6 (s), typical of a lactone carbonyl function. Analysis of the 1 H NMR spectral data showed that the signal of H-3 resonates at d 6.79 (br s), while this proton in compound 1 resonates at d 5.99 (br s). The only explanation of this chemical shift dierence (Dd 0.81) observed for H-3 must be that the hemiacetal function at C-18 in 1 is converted to a carbonyl group in 2. The presence of only one acetyl and one butanoyl group in 2 was also con®rmed by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and2). The locations of the acetyl moieties were de®ned by 1 H-13 C long-range COLOC spectra. The hydrogen linked to the C-19 methine showed a correlation with the C-18 carbonyl carbon of the lactone ring (d 172.6). The modi®cation of the chemical shift values in the 13 C NMR spectrum of C-3 and C-4 (d 132.4 and 142.0, respectively) corroborated the assignment of the carbonyl function to C-18 [12]. As the position and con®guration of the methoxy group of the casearin analogue compounds were determined in C-2 by INADEQUATE spectra [10] and X-ray analysis [10], the butanoyl group was de®ned as linked to C-7, although no correlation was observed in long-range spectra between H-7 and the carbonyl of the butanoyl group. The equatorial orientation of the butanoyl function at C-7 was inferred by considering the coupling constants observed for H-7 in 2 and comparison with those of casearin G. The relative con®guration of the stereogenic carbon C-2 in 2 was assigned on the basis of 1 H-1 H COSY spectra and comparison of these data with those reported for casearin analogues [11]. Caserarin T (3) was obtained as a colorless oil after acetylation. This diterpene also showed 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral characteristics similar to other casearins [8±12]. Compound 3 has a marked structural resemblance to casearins B, P and Q, due the presence of a acetyl group at C-6 [8,10]. The spectral data (Tables 1 and2) obtained for 3 were consistent with the structural features of casearins, usually characterized by methoxy, acetoxy and butanoyloxy moieties. In the case of 3, the 13 C NMR spectral data (Table 2) were compatible with the structure proposed for this diterpene. One methoxy function at C-2, three acetoxy groups at C-18, C-19, C-6, and one butanoyloxy group at C-7 were assigned by analysis of 1 H- 13 C long-range COLOC correlations. Again, the correlation between H-7 and the carbonyl of the butanoyl group was not observed. However, correlations of H-6, H-18 and H-19 with carbonyl groups at d 170.2, 170.4 and 170.0 respectively, attributed to acetoxy functions linked to the corresponding carbons, provided clear evidence for the location of these groups and consequently for the structure of 3. Further, the proton signal of H-6 (d 5.37) in 3 was coupled with H-7 (d 5.17) by 4.7 Hz, completely dierent for C-6 (d 5.19, J = 10.6 Hz) in casearins B and Q [10,11]. Since the acetoxy groups in these latter compounds are in equatorial positions, the acetoxyl function in 3 must be b and axial. Further evidence for the b-disposition of the functional group at C-6 in 3 was provided by the chemical shift value of C-8 at d 37.1, shielded by 2 ppm in relation to casearins B and Q [9,10].The biological activity data for diterpenes 1±3 in the mechanism-based yeast mutant bioassay are given in Table 3. All three diterpenoid compounds showed selective activity in the Rad 52Y and RS 321 assay compared with the wild type Rad+ strain [13].
EXPERIMENTAL
Instrumentation and chromatography materialsSilica gel (Merck, 230±400 and 70±230 Mesh) was used for all column chromatography unless otherwise stated, and solvents were redistilled prior to use. The 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer at 200 MHz with TMS as internal standard. 13 C NMR and 2D NMR were performed at 50 MHz with TMS as internal standard. Mass spectra were taken on a Platform II spectrometer. Optical activities were measured on a Carl Zeiss Jena Polamat A. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer.
Plant materialThe aerial parts of Casearia sylvestris SW (Flacourtiaceae) were collected at the Florestal Reserve at Martinho Prado (SaÄ o Paulo State, Brazil) in October 1994. A voucher specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, SaÄ o Paulo, Brazil.
BioassayIdentical to those reported in Ref. [13].
Extraction and isolation of constituentsThe dried and powdered leaves of C. sylvestris (3.5 kg) were sequentially extracted with cold n-hexane and a mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (2:1, v/v). The latter extract (13.5 g) was subjected to gel ®ltration with elution by n-hexane, CH 2 Cl 2 , EtOAc and MeOH. The bioactive CH 2 Cl 2 fraction was concentrated in vacuo to aord a brown gum (1.2 g), Table 2. 13 C NMR spectral data for casearins G (1), S (2) and T (3)

Rechromatography on Si gel Prep TLC eluted with hexane:EtOAc (8:2) yielded pure casearin S (5.2 mg). F-22 (213 mg) was also submitted to acetylation [213 mg on 1 mL Py, 1.5 mL Ac 2 O, overnight] and the acetylated mixture was subjected to Si gel CC (230±400 Mesh) (25 g), eluted with increasing amounts of EtOAc in hexane to give 20 fractions. Fraction 19 was applied to a Si gel column, eluted with hexane with increasing amounts of EtOAc to give ®ve fractions.
