C-METHYL PHENOLICS FROM QUALEA SPECIES*
The trunk wood of Qualea lubouriauana contains, besides (2R)-5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3'-methoxy-6,8dimethylflavanone, (2R)-5,7,4'-trihydroxy-8-methylflavanone, the biosynthetically interesting 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,6,4',6'tetramethoxy-3,3'-dimethylbenzophenone.From the trunk wood extract of Q. puraen.sis the first named flavanone crystallized out directly.

INTRODUCTIONPrevious publications report the presence of ellagic acid and five derivatives and of 7,3',4'-trihydroxyflavone and three derivatives respectively in the wood of Erismu calcaratum (Link) Warm., Salvertia convullariodora St.Hil.. Vochysia acuminatu Bongard, 1/: tyrsoidecr Pohl.[ 1 ] and in the leaves of S. convalluriodora,
V cinnamomeaPohl., K tucanorum Mart. [2]. The present communication reports the presence of the C-methylated flavanones la, 2a, 3a and benzophenone 4a in the wood ofQu&a labouriauana Paula [3]. (2R)-5,7,4'-Trihydroxy-3'-methoxy-6,8_dimethylflavanone(la) was also isolated from Q. paruensis Ducke [4], a further South American species of the Vochysiaceae. apears in the triacetate (lg) at slightly higher field (A7 + 0.08 ppm). The AB-part (z cu 3.15 for lb) is resolved in lg into a doublet (Ar -0.20, J = 8 Hz) and a double doublet (AL\~ -0.06, J = 8, 3 Hz). These facts indicate that all protons are ortho or para related with only one oxyfunction and that it is the proton which is coupled only to an ortho-proton which is vicinal to the OH group in la. The usual 4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy B ring pattern thus prevails in the compound.
RESULTS
CompoundsThe 'H NMRspectraof2a,C,,H,O,(OH),Me,andof poriol (2b) [7,8], though not identical, are very similar. The mps, however, are quite distinct: 2a 195-200 ', 2b 265-270 [7]. Since both products show identical ORD curves (for 2b see [9]), they can differ only by the location of the A ring methyl.Compound 3a is a (2S, 3S)-dihydroflavonol, as shown by an ORD curve [5] and the typical NMR signals for the protons at C-2 and C-3 [6]. The 4'-hydroxy pattern for ring B is evidenced by the AA'BB' signals shifted to substantially lower field upon acetylation to 3b. The reaction gives also evidence for the hydroxyl at C-3 [AT -0.72ppm (H-2), -1.33ppm (H-3)]. Indeed, the UV AICI, shift is reversed upon addition of HCI, a fact which is inconsistent with the existence of a hydroxyl at C-5. The IR carbonyl maximum at 1675 cm-' is also compatible with a 3-hydroxy-5-methoxyflavanone[lo].  The unifying feature of the compounds from these Q~~~lecr species is the substitution of the acetate derived phloroglucinol units by C-methyls. Specially interesting is the benzophenone in which two such units are joined by a carbonyl group. This group. however, may also have originated from a C-methyl. formation of the compound involving oxidative coupling of dimethylated and monomethylatcd phloroglucinol la and 2a are (2R)-flavanones as shown by ORD curves [5] and the typical NMR signals for the protons at C-2 and C-3 [6]. Due to the slight solubility of la in the usual deuterated solvents the NMR spectral analysis referred to dimethyl (1 b), diethyl (Id) and dibenzyl (le) ethers, as well as to di-(lf) and tri-(lg) acetates. Interpretation of all signals led to the formula C,,H,O,(OH),OMe. Me, for the natural compound. The presence of hydroxyls at C-5 and C-7 was ascertained by UV shifts, respectively with AlCl, and NaOAc. The action of AICI, is not instantaneous, a methyl group at C-6. The other methyl is located at C-8 since the three' aromatic protons, forming an ABX-system, must all be located on ring B. The 270 MHz spectrum shows the X-part, at the low field end of the signal (7 2.76 for 1 b), as a doublet (J = 3 Hz) which *Part 11 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Vochysiaceae". For Part 1 see ref. [l]. Based on part of the M.S. thesis submitted by L.F.B.G. to Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (1979).
111. The remaining hydroxyl must be located at C-7 (UV NaOAc shift). This leaves only C-6 or C-8 for the methyl, the former location being preferred tentatively on account of the neatness of the aromatic singlet (T 3.83). The methoxyl protons would be expected to cause broadening of the H-6 signal [12]. The molecular formula of 4a, C,,H,,O,, determined by HRMS, was expanded to C,,H,(OH),-(OMe),Me,CO after inspection of the 'H NMR spectrum which shows only five singlets at 7 2.1 (OH), 3.9 (ArH), 6.0 (ArOMe), 6.2 (ArOMe) and 7.98 (ArMe). The compound must AlCl, shift) and highly hindered, acetylation of the compound leading only to a diacetate (4b) and in low yield. The sole structure 4a which is compatible with these data is corroborated by the 'H NMR spectrum of this acetate which shows singlets at T 3.58 and 3.65 (2 ArH), 6.2 (4 ArOMe). 7.72 and 7.82 (2 ArOAc), 8.16 and 8.17
(2  ArMe). Chelation having ceased, repulsion of the acetoxyl groups causes the asymmetry of the rings with respect to the carbonyl which is now observed.
