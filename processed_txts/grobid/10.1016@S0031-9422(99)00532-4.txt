6-[o-arylalkenyl]-5,6-dihydro-a-pyrones from Cryptocarya moschata (Lauraceae)
Eleven 6-[o-arylalkenyl]-5,6-dihydro-a-pyrones, cryptomoscatones D2, E1, E2, E3 and F1 and cryptopyranmoscatones A1, A2, A3, B1, B2 and B4, in addition to goniothalamin and cryptofolione, were isolated from branch and stem bark of Cryptocarya moschata, Lauraceae. Their structures were established by spectroscopic methods.

IntroductionCryptocarya moschata (Lauraceae) is a tree growing up to 30±40 m high, which is found in the Atlantic Forest, mainly in the Southeastern Region of Brazil. It is popularly known as ``canela batalha'', ``canela branca'', ``canela noz-moscada'', ``nhutinga-branca'' or ``anhuvinha-branca''.Cryptocarya spp. contain alkaloids, and some species have a-pyrones as additional secondary metabolites. Indeed, the occurrence of 5,6-dihydro-a-pyrones (substituted at C6 by alkyl or arylalkyl groups) has been noted in 13 botanical families and 20 species of fungi (Davies-Coleman & Rivett, 1989). These metabolites are biosynthesized from either acetate or mixed acetate±shikimate pathways (Leete, Muir & Towers, 1982).Naturally occurring 6-aryl-5,6-dihydro-a-pyrones originating from the mixed biosynthetic pathway have been observed in only six genera: Aniba (Franca, Gottlieb & Suarez, 1973) and Cryptocarya (Lauraceae), Goniothalamus (Annonaceae), Piper (Piperaceae), Psilotum and Tmesipteris (Psilotaceae) (Davies- Coleman & Rivett, 1989).The 6-aryl-or 6-arylalkyl-5,6-dihydro-a-pyrones from lauraceous species are characteristics of Aniba and Cryptocarya species. The a-pyrones of Aniba sp. possess a C4 methoxyl group, and a saturated or unsaturated carbonaceous side chain on C6. On the other hand, the pyrones of Cryptocarya are not substituted on C4 and instead have a styryl group attached to the C6 side chain. Some 5,6-dihydro-a-pyrones derived only from the acetate pathway, were also found in Cryptocarya species (Drewes, Horn & Mavi, 1997;Drewes, Horn & Wijewardene, 1996;Drewes, Horn & Scott-Shaw, 1995).The present work describes the occurrence of 13 6-[o-arylalkenyl]-5,6-dihydro-a-pyrones, including the known goniothalamin (1) and cryptofolione (2), and 11 new pyrones (3±13) in the branch and stem bark of C. moschata.
Results and discussionCompounds 1±13 were puri®ed as described in Section 3; (+) Goniothalamin (1) had been previously isolated from C. caloneura (Hlubucek & Robertson, 1967), C. latifolia and C. wyliei (Drewes et al., 1995) and from Goniothalamus species (Jewers et al., 1972).The 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectroscopic signals of the other isolated compounds revealed certain common features, viz. a styryl group and a 5,6-dihydro-a-pyrone group (Tables 1±4). In compounds 2±7, these groups are connected by a linear and hydroxylated carbonic chain, and by a carbonic chain with a dihydroxy-tetrahydropyrane ring in compounds 8±13. In addition, compounds 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 have a trans-disubstituted double bond at C1 '±C2' Hd 5.7 ddt (J = 16, 6 and 1 Hz) and H5.9 dtd (J = 16, 7 and 1 Hz)]. These skeleta were proposed based on 1 H± 1 H COSY experiments.The molecular weight of each compound was determined by observation of [M + K] + and [M + Na] + adducts in the ES±MS spectra. The hydroxymethine carbons on the aliphatic chains were proposed based on their 13 C-NMR chemical shifts d 64±74), associated with the strong IR absorption at 3400±3390 cm À1 and the fragmentation patterns + revealed by ES±MS spectral analyses. The diacetates obtained from 5, 8 and 9 con®rmed the presence of these hydroxyl groups.[M À H 2 O + H] + , [M À H 2 O] + , [M À H 2 O À H] + , [M À 2H 2 O + H] + , [M À 2H 2 O] + , and/or [M À 2H 2 O À H]The 1 H-NMR signals of compounds 1±7 (Table 1) were assigned by 1 H± 1 H COSY. The 13 C-NMR signals of 5 were assigned by 1 H± 13 C COSY, while the signals for compounds 2, 3 and 4 were assigned by comparison with 5 (Table 2).Compounds 2 and 3 possess the same molecular formula (C 17 H 20 O 4 ) and showed in the 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra, besides absorptions observed for styryl and a-pyrone groups, signals relative to two oxymethine and two methylene carbons. Compound 2 was identi®ed as cryptofolione, previously isolated from C. latifolia and C. myrtifolia (Sehlapelo, Drewes & Scott-Shaw, 1994). More subtle dierences in the 13 C-NMR chemical shifts of compounds 2 and 3 were noted at carbons 2 ' and 4 ' (Table 2), showing that they consist of a diastereomeric pair. To determine the relative con-®guration of these pairs, compounds 14±17 were used as models (Homann & Wiedmann, 1985), and the hydrogen bonding of 1,3-diols was considered to enable the molecule to assume a chair-like conformation (Fig. 1). The lower ®eld chemical shifts of C2 ' and C4 ' of compound 2 were in concordance with an erythro con®guration, where the substituents (styryl and a-pyrone ring) possess an equatorial conformation. On the other hand, the higher ®eld chemical shifts of C2 ' and C4 ' in the compound 3 point to an erythro con®guration, where at least one substituent (styryl or pyrone ring) possesses an axial conformation.Compounds 4 and 5, with an additional trans-vinyl moiety as compared to compounds 2 and 3, possess a molecular formula C 19 H 22 O 4 , and constitute another pair of 1,3-diols (Table 2). Thus, the lower ®eld chemical shifts of C4 ' and C6 ' point to an erythro con®guration for compound 4 and the higher ®eld chemical shifts of C4 ' and C6 ' indicate a threo con®guration for compound 5.The molecular formula of 6 (C 19 H 24 O 5 ) diers from the molecular formula of 7 (C 21 H 26 O 5 ) only by a C 2 H 2 unit, attributed to a trans-vinyl moiety. The relative con®gurations of three oxymethine carbons of compounds 6 and 7 were established based on comparison of their 13 C-NMR chemical shifts with those of compounds 2 or 3 and 4 or 5, respectively. It was possible to propose a threo relationship between OH-2 ' and OH-4' of compound 6 and between OH-4 ' and OH-6 ' of compound 7 when C2 ' d 64.5) of 6 was compared with C2 ' d 64.7) of 3 and when C4 ' d 68.1) of 7 was compared with C4 ' d 68.1) of 5, respectively. Similarly, C6 ' d 73.8) of compound 6 and C8 ' d 73.6) of compound 7 were compared with C4 ' d 73.7) of 2 and C6 ' d 73.5) of 4, respectively, indicating an erythro relationship between OH-4 ' and OH-6 ' of 6 and OH-6 ' and OH-8 ' of 7.The 1 H± 1 H COSY correlation spectra and the 1 H-NMR coupling constants observed for 8±13 are in accordance with a dihydroxy-tetrahydropyrane ring, probably originated by dehydration and cyclization of polyhydroxyalkenyl chain. The diacetates 8a and 9a obtained from compounds 8 and 9 con®rmed two hydroxyl groups. The assignment of 1 H-and 13 C-NMR chemical shifts for compounds 8±10 and 12±13 was carried out by 1 H± 1 H and 1 H± 13 C COSY, and for compound 11 the assignment was based on comparison with spectral data of compounds 12±13 (Tables 3 and4).The stereochemistry of the dihydroxy-tetrahydropyrane ring of compound 8 was determined by analysis of 1 H-NMR coupling constants. The H5 ' signal d 3.22, dd, JH9 Hz) indicated a trans-diaxial relationship with H6 ' and H4 '; H3' ax d 1.46, ddd, J H 12 Hz) shows, besides geminal coupling, a trans-diaxial relationship with H4 ' and H2 '. Therefore, H2 ', H4', H5' and H6 ' are in axial positions.For compound 9, the stereochemistry of dihydroxytetrahydropyrane ring was also determined by the 1 H-NMR coupling constant of H7 ' d 3.22, dd, J H 9 Hz) and of H5 ' ax d 1.43, ddd, J H 12 Hz) signals, which indicated the axial position of H4 ', H6', H7' and H8 '.The H6 ' and H8 ' signals in the 1 H-NMR spectrum of compound 10 are overlapped. However, the contour lines of H6 '±H7 ' cross-peak in the 1 H± 1 H COSY spectrum were used to determine the multiplicity of H6 ' d  The con®guration of compound 11 was determined in a similar way. The contour lines of H8 '±H9 ' crosspeak observed in the 1 H± 1 H COSY spectrum showed that H8 ' is a double doublet (J H 9 Hz), allowing the assignment of the axial position to H8 ' and H7 '. Therefore, H6 ' is in an equatorial position because H7 ' signal is a double doublet (J = 9 and 3 Hz). The axial position of H4 ' was determined through the multiplicity of H5 ' ax d 1.58, ddd, J H 12, 12 and 5 Hz), which can be explained by the geminal coupling H5 ' ax ± H5 ' eq (J = 12 Hz), trans-diaxial coupling H5 ' ax ±H4' ax (J = 12 Hz) and H5 ' ax ±H6 ' eq (J = 5 Hz). In compound 12, the multiplicity of H3 ' ax d 1.58, ddd, J H 12 Hz) points to axial position of H2 ' and H4 ', and the coupling constant of 1 Hz observed in H3 ' eq d 1.68, dddd, J = 13, 5, 2.5 and 1 Hz) in 1 H-NMR spectra in CD 3 CN, results from a long range W coupling constant between H3 ' eq and H5 ' eq . The signal of H6 ' (d 4.03, ddd, J = 5.5, 1.5 and 1.5 Hz, in CD 3 CN) does not allow establishment of the stereochemistry at C6 '.For compound 13, the axial position of H4 ' and H6 ' was determined by the H5 ' ax signal d 1.65, ddd, J H 13, 10 and 10 Hz), and the equatorial position of H7 ' was deduced from the multiplicity of H6 ' d 3.98, ddd, J = 10, 5 and 3 Hz). The resonance of H8 ' d 4.68, ddd, J = 5.5, 3 and 2 Hz), as in the case of H6 ' in compound 12, does not indicate the con®guration at C8 '.  However, C6 ' of 12 d 78.4) is less shielded than C8 ' of 13 d 76.1), and it is possible to propose an equatorial position for the styryl moiety on compound 12 and an axial position on compound 13. This is reinforced by the chemical shifts of H6 ' and H8 ', d 4.11 and d 4.68, respectively, in the 1 H-NMR spectra of 12 and 13.The C6 R con®guration of compounds 2±13 was determined using the Snatzke rule (Snatzke, 1968), considering the pseudo-equatorial orientation of the C6 substituent and the positive signal of the Cotton eect in CD curves at 254±272 nm, due to n 4 p Ã transition, for all compounds. The conformation of a-pyrone ring was inferred by steric factors (Davies-Coleman & Rivett, 1989) and reinforced by the H5 pseudo-ax -NMR signal d 2.32, dddd, J = 18, 10, 3 and 3 Hz) of compound 12, which shows a trans-diaxial H5±H6 coupling constant (J = 10 Hz) and by the H6-NMR signal of compounds 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 d 4.9, ddd, J = 9, 6 and 6 Hz), in CD 3 CN (data not shown), which show trans-diaxial H5±H6 coupling constants (J = 9 Hz). 
Experimental
GeneralThe silica gel and solvents used for either VLC or ¯ash chromatography were obtained from Merck, whereas the solvents used for HPLC were from either Merck (Lichrosolv grade) or Aldrich (HPLC grade). The HPLC used for analytical analyses was a quaternary pump system Perkin±Elmer Series 4, equipped with a UV/VIS HP 1050 detector and Perkin±Elmer 3600 Data Station; for preparative analyses, a binary pump system (Perkin±Elmer Series 3B) was employed, equipped with a UV/VIS Perkin±Elmer LC-85B detector and an HP 3396 integrator. The 1 H-NMR (200 MHz) and 13 C-NMR (50 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker-AC 200, using either CDCl 3 or CD 3 CN (Aldrich) as solvent, with TMS as internal standard.The elemental analyses were measured on a Elemental Analyser Perkin±Elmer model 2400 CHN. EI±MS data was obtained at 70 eV using a Hewlett Packard HP 5988-A mass spectrometer, and ES±MS data was collected on a Fisons VG Platform II in the positive mode. UV spectra were recorded on a Perkin±Elmer l 3B Spectrometer; infra-red spectra were obtained with a Nicolet FT 510 Spectrometer. CD curves were obtained using a ISA Jobin Yvon CD 6 dicrograph.
Extraction and isolation of constituentsBranch bark (197 g) and stem bark (360 g) were individually dried at 508C, then milled, and each extracted with EtOH±H 2 O (96:4 v/v) at room temperature. The EtOH extracts were separately concentrated in vacuo and then partitioned between petrol/EtOH/ H 2 O (5:3:2 v/v) (3Â) and CHCl 3 /EtOH/H 2 O (5:3:2 v/ v) (3Â). The CHCl 3 phase of the branch bark solubles was concentrated in vacuo yielding 5.0 g, and then divided into four fractions (I Ð 400 mg, II Ð 900 mg, III Ð 600 mg, IV Ð 3000 mg) by VLC (Si-60, 10 Â 4.7 cm, 63±200 mm), using a gradient of increasing polarity (petrol/CH 2 Cl 2 /CHCl 3 /MeOH 76:10:8:6 to petrol/CH 2 Cl 2 /CHCl 3 /MeOH 21:33:25:21). Fraction II was fractionated by VLC (Si-60, 10 Â 3.4 cm, 63±200 mm) with the same eluents, yielding IIa (380 mg) and IIb (500 mg). Fraction IIa was then puri®ed by HPLC (Lichrosorb Si-60 250 Â 10 mm, 7 mm), with petrol/ CH 2 Cl 2 /CHCl 3 /MeOH 94:2.5:2:1.5, 5.0 ml/min (280 nm), to give 20 mg of goniothalamin (1). Fraction III gave IIIa (210 mg), IIIb (73 mg) and IIIc (85 mg) by ¯ash chromatography (Si-60, 15 Â 3 cm, 40±63 mm) eluting with petrol/CH 2 Cl 2 /CHCl 3 /MeOH 68.5:13:10:8.5. Fraction IIIc was puri®ed on HPLC (Perkin±Elmer RP-8 250 Â 22 mm, 10 mm), eluted with THF/HOAc 5% 19:81, 17 ml/min (250 nm) yielding 5.8 mg of 6 and 7.9 mg of 7. The CHCl 3 phase of stem bark was concentrated in vacuo yielding 10.6 g, and then separated into ®ve fractions (I ' Ð 25 mg, II ' Ð 934 mg, III ' Ð 3000 mg, IV ' Ð 3500 mg, V ' Ð 600 mg) by VLC (Si-60, 10 Â 8 cm, 63 ±200 mm), using a gradient of increasing polarity (CH g yielded 12, 8 and 13. The total amount obtained of each compound was 2.9 mg of cryptofolione (2), 5.8 mg of (3), 4.5 mg of (4), 13.3 mg of (5), 12.0 mg of (8), 12.9 mg of (9), 5.7 mg of (10), 4.4 mg of (11), 6.0 mg of (12) and 2.5 mg of (13).3.4. Acetylation of 5, 8 and 9 100 ml of pyridine and 100 ml of acetic anhydride were added to 2 mg of each compound.
