5-DEOXYGOYAZENSOLIDE, A NEW HELIANGOLIDE FROM VANILLOSMOPSIS ER Y THROPAPPA*
INTRODUCIlON
DISCUSSIONIn an earlier article [I] the isolation of eremanthin [2l and costunolide from the schistosomicidal wood oil of Vuniliosnwpsis eFythroppp Sch. Bip, (Vernonieae, Vemoninae) was report@ [3J. We now describe isolation and structure determination of 15deoxygoyazensolide (la) from a hexane extract of the herbaceous parts of this plant.  (high resolution MS), mp 132-4", [a]$$ -38", was a y-la&one with a conjugated exoqclk methylene group (IR band 1770 and 1650 cm-', strong UV end absorption, sharp daublets at 621 and 5.45 ppm in the NMR spectrum) and a methacrylic ester function (IR bands at 1710 and 1640 cm-'+ broad vinyl methyl signal at I.82 ppm and two multiplets at 6.01 and 5.54 ppm, significant MS peak at m/e M-CbH50).The NMR spectrum of the new lactone (see Table 1) was essentially superimposable on that of goyazensolide (lb) from Eremanthus gayazensis Sch. Bip. [5-J except for the resonances of the C-15 hydroxymethylene protons of lb, which were replaced by a narrowly-split vinyl methyl triplet at 206 allylically coupled to a vinyl proton   cannot be obtain& in an unrearranged form. Also the I?MR-spectrum of the hexaacetate is in agreement with an acetylated #Cgalactosidopyranoside (Table 1). Furthermore the spectrum shows three Me-singlets, a secondary OCOMe group [dd 6 = 4.75(J = 2,2 Hz)], the group CH,C(Me)=CHC&OAc, a methylene group (s(h) 4.91 md 5.10) as well as a further secondary nCHUR group Cdd4.43 (J = 2,2)].These data correspond with a bieyclic diterpene with three O-functions. Manganese dioxide oxidation shows the presence of a primary allylic OI-I.Further PMR studies lead to the structure 1, its absolute configuration not being clear. Also the 13C NMRspectrum is in agreement with 1. The correlation of the signals could be achieved by an "o&esonance"-spectrum and by using Yb(fod), as shift-reagent.

The crude gum, wt 25 g, was chromatographed over Si gel-AgNOs (30x), wt 750 g, 200 ml fractions being eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (hexane), EtOAc ac6 tate and then with EtOAc-EtOH mixtures. The material from fractions 83-92 (hexanc-EtOAc 5: 1) was combined, wt. 1.29 g; a portion (0.5 g) was further purified by preparative TLC on silica gel (hexane-EtOAc, 2.5 : 1). The fraction which exhibited a violet fluorescence under UV light was eluted, to yield 45 mg of gum which was recrystallized from hexane to give an A. G. RAMA~NDRAN NAIR~-, S.
