DISTRIBUTION OF COUMARINS IN AMAZONIAN BROSIMUM SPECIES*
Fourteen Brosimum species (Moraceae) contain either pyranocoumarins or furocoumarins, besides 0-prenylbrosiparin which gives rise to brosiprenin by a Claisen type rearrangement. * Part IV in the series "Plant Chemosystematics and Phylogeny". For Part III see Ref. 1.

Two BRAZILIAN Brosimum species have so far been examined phytochemically : B. gaudichaudii Trtcul whose roots were reported to contain psoralen (Ia)" and bergapten (Ib),2*3 and B. rubescens Taubert whose trunk wood contains xanthyletin (IIa), luvangetin (IIb), 7-demethylsuberosin (IIIa), brosiparin (IIIb) and brosiprenin (IIIc).~ It was considered thatrthe biosynthesis of 111~ might involve a Claisen type rearrangement, in spite of the fact that O-prenylbrosiparin (IIId) had not been detected in the extract of B. rubescers4The hypothesis, however, seemed so attractive that a search for the putative precursor IIId was undertaken in wood samples of 13 Amazonian Brosimum species. As far as TLC comparisons of extracts obtained from preserved voucher specimens merit confidence, the analysis of the results (Table 1) leads to the following comments.L&Q0 xllplo *o R (Ia) E R R' R2 R3 (IIa) H (DIa) H H H Mb) OMe Cub) OMe (IICb) OH Me H CCUc) OH Me Pre (lICd)OPre Me HPhytochemically, the examined Brosimum species fall into two sections characterized by the predominant presence either of pyranocoumarins or of furocoumarins. Prenylcoumarins are, of course, precursors to both types of compounds, as indicated by the constant quantitative ratio of xanthyletin (IIa) and 7-demethylsuberosin (IIIa) in most extracts, as well as the co-occurrence of luvangetin (IIb) and brosiparin (IIIb). O-Prenylbrosiparin (IIId) was detected in the particular species of the pyranocoumarin section which contains 0. R. GOTTLIEB, Phytochem. 11, 1537 (1972).
