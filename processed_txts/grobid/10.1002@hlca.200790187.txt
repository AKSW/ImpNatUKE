A New ent-Kaurane Diterpene from Stems of Alibertia macrophylla K. Schum. (Rubiaceae)
Phytochemical investigations of the stems of a specimen of Alibertia macrophylla led to the isolation and characterization of the new diterpene ent-kaurane-2b,3a,16a-triol (1), along with triterpenes 2 -8, iridoids 9 -12, and phenolic acids 13 -15. The structure of 1 was established based on spectroscopic studies ( 1 H-and 13 C-NMR, IR, and HR-ESI-MS). This is the first report of the isolation of a diterpene from the Alibertia genus in Rubiaceae.

Introduction. -Plants of the Alibertia genus are known to be a rich source of pentacyclic triterpenes [1 -3]. Moreover, Alibertia belongs to the Ixoroideae subfamily in Rubiaceae, these being known for the occurrence of iridoids as main secondary metabolites [4]. Previous investigation of the leaves of A. macrophylla resulted in the isolation of non-glycosidic iridoids 1b-and 1a-hydroxydihydrocornin aglycones, and the caffeic acid esters 2-phenylethyl caffeoate and 2-methyl-4-hydroxybutyl caffeoate [5].This paper reports the occurrence of a new ent-kaurane diterpene (1) from A. macrophylla stems in addition to seven triterpenes 2 -8, four glucosidic iridoids 9 -12, three phenolic acids 13 -15, and two steroids 16 and 17. It is the first report of a diterpene from any Alibertia species, but ent-kauranes were previously isolated from Chiococca alba [6] and Tricalysia dubia [7] species of the family Rubiaceae.Results and Discussion. -Dried and powdered stems of Alibertia macrophylla were successively extracted with hexane, AcOEt and EtOH. The hexane extract was submitted to chromatography (column and preparative TLC) to afford lupenone (2), germanicone (3), a-amirenone (4), b-amirenone (5), lupeol (6), and oleanolic (7) and ursolic (8) acids. The AcOEt was fractionated by using a combined chromatographic column on silica gel and RP18, preparative TLC and preparative RP-HPLC to afford 6a-( 9) and 6b-hydroxygeniposide (10), gardenoside (11), shanziside methyl ester (12), and protocatechuic (13), vanilic (14), and caffeic (15) acids, sitosterol ( 16) stigmasterol (17), and the new ent-kaurane-2b,3a,16a-triol (1).Compounds 2 -17 were identified by comparing their 1 H-and 13 C-NMR data with those previously published [1] [8 -13].Compound 1 was isolated as a yellow amorphous powder. The HR-ESI-MS of  HÀC(3) in NOESY spectrum. From the NOESY spectrum, HÀC(3) was defined as being in an axial position (b), and its coupling constant of 9.5 Hz indicated that HÀC(2) is also in an axial position but with an a-orientation. Compound 1 was, therefore, identified as ent-kaurane-2b,3a,16a-triol. Thus, this is the first report of this ent-kaurane in literature, and it is the first report of the isolation of a diterpene from the Alibertia genus in Rubiaceae. The occurrence of triterpenes 2 -8, iridoids 9 -12, and phenolic acids 13 -15 in Alibertia is in agreement with chemosystematic correlations and botanical positioning of this genus in the subfamily Ixoroideae [17].1 exhibited its [M þ Na] þ peakThe authors wish to thank the Brazilian Agencies for fellowships to V.

The dried and powdered stems (550.0 g) of A. macrophylla were successively extracted with hexane, AcOEt, and EtOH at r.t. After evaporation, the hexane extract (2.80 g) was submitted to CC (silica gel (70 -200 mesh); gradient of hexane/AcOEt) to give ten Fractions after TLC analysis. Fr. 2 (350.0 mg) was subjected to a CC (silica gel (35 -70 mesh); hexane/AcOEt 98 : 02 (v/v)) to afford a mixture of 2 -5 (133.6 mg). Fr. 4 (140.0 mg) was purified by a prep. TLC (hexane/AcOEt 4 : 1 (v/v)) to afford 6 (54.8 mg). Fr. 7 (103.0 mg) was submitted to prep. TLC (hexane/ AcOEt 7 : 3 (v/v)) to afford a mixture of 7 and 8 (15.0 mg). The AcOEt extract (8.0 g) was subjected to CC (RP18; gradient of MeOH/H 2 O and EtOAc/MeOH) to give 13 Fractions after TLC analysis. Fr. 3 (380.0 mg) was purified by prep. HPLC (C18 column; MeOH/H 2 O 3 :7 (v/v); 10 ml/min; l ¼ 238 nm) to afford 9 (48.0 mg), 10 (13.2 mg), a mixture of 11 and 13 (15.0 mg), and a mixture of 14 and 15 (9.0 mg). Fr. 4 (1.5 g) was submitted to CC (RP18; gradients of MeOH/H 2 O and EtOAc/MeOH) to give eight subfractions after TLC analysis. Fr. 4.4 (70.0 mg) was purified by prep. HPLC (C18 column; MeOH/H 2 O/ MeCO 2 H 34 : 165 : 1 (v/v/v); 10 ml/min; l ¼ 254 nm) to afford 9 (8.3 mg), 10 (12.5 mg), 11 (5.8 mg), and 14 (3.0 mg). Fr. 4.5 (70.0 mg) was submitted to a purification by CC (RP18; MeOH/H 2 O gradient) to afford 12 (16.4 mg) and 14 (8.7 mg). Fr. 6 (800.0 mg) was submitted to a CC (silica gel (35 -70 mesh); gradient of AcOEt/MeOH) to afford 1 (130.0 mg). Fr. 7 (300.0 mg) was purified by CC (silica gel (35 -70 mesh); gradient of hexane/AcOEt) to afford a mixture of 16
