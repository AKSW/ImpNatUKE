ALKALOID STUDIES-LVIII. THE ALKALOIDS OF SIX ASPIDOSPERMA SPECIES
A&met-Thealkaloida of a number of Aspidmpmma species wcrc isolated and identifkd. In one species the lignanea (-)-lirioresino1-C and (+)-G.Gdimethyllirioresinol-B were also enmuntered.

IN CONTINUATION of previous work' directed towards a complete chemo-taxonomic survey2 of the genus Aspidospenna a further series of species has been studied. In general the alkaloids isolated belong to well-defined groups, already found in the genus and normally characteristic of the botanical sub-group~.~ Thus, for example, the sub-group Nitida (A. rig&, nitidim, and marcgraviamun) is characterized by indolic alkaloids of the heteroyohimbine and corynantheol types, while the Pyricolla (A. pyricohn and nigricans) and Tomentosa sub groups contain as principal constituents uleine and related alkaloids. The appearance of (+>stemmadenine (I) previously found in the genera Stemmadenia' and Melodin& is noteworthy for although it is a natural precursor of the aspidospermatidine group of alkaloids based on structure (II), it had not been previously encountered in Aspidiwpema.Picraline (III), 5* 6 isolated for the fh-st time from this genus, is closely related to alkaloids found earlier, for example, aspidodasycarpine (IV). 7 A list of the alkaloids is given in the Table .

NEs!!? ii H   $ A. pyricolfum is normally a maritime species. The present specimen from an atypical inland habitat showed slight morphological differences. It was collected at km 18 of the Porto Seguro-BRS road, Bahia.,! A. p@coilum Mull.-Arg. fruits were collected from trees on the sandy coastal strip, Rio de Janeiro. This variety is that prevtously studied.". *O CA. nigritnns collected in Pot-to Seguro, Bahia, has been studied pre\gously.t The present specimen collected in Garanhuns, Pernambuco (Instituto de Pesquisas AgronBmicas. Recife Herbarium No. 13'?1), appears to be the same species and yields olivacrne, olivacme-N-oxide and guatambuine as principal constituents. Uleine and dihydrouierne now encountered, were not found in the Porto Seguro specimen, and m view of the difference the firm identification of the present species as nigricntu must await further botanical examination. ** A. tome~tosum was collected on the Fazenda da M&e D'agua. Wrzea da Palma, Mtnas Gerats, and is distingutshed from co-occurrent species by possessing bark free ofcork. We thank Dr. JosC Vtcente Goncalves Pmto and the Belgo-Mineira Iron Company for assistance in their collectton.tt This alkaloid has been isolated stmultaneously in two other laboratortcs, from species of Aspidosperma collected by us: A. Iimac Woodqon.2' und A. srtbitzconunr Mart.24
A. ~c~~~Woodson was tbe object of an earlier studyI when aricine and dihydrocorynantbeol were isolated from the bark. The former again appeared as a major constituent of the wood. In addition to the alkaloids recorded in the table, the lignanes (-)&ioresinoEC (XVII)zs* 26 and (+)-O,OdimethyIlirioresinol-B (XVfH)zs* 27*28 were isolated.12-Hydroxy-Kacetylaspidospermatidine (XVI) (see Table note??) the N-acetyl anaiogue of Iimatine (XlX)2q was characterized as a 7-hy~oxy-~-~~~hydroindole by its i.r. and U.V. absorption .= NMR and mass spectra1 data were consistent with structure (XVI), the precisely determined mass of the molecular ion, 324.18367 confirming the molecular formula, C&-#~NsO~. Location of the ethyhdene sidechain at position 14 was con&-med by the appearance of the C-3 proton as a singlet (452 ppm) superimposed on the C-2 proton quartet, as well as by tire mass spectral breakdown of the hydrogenation product, 14,19-~hydr~~~hydroxy-~-a~~I~pidos~~tidine (XX). The diagnostic peaks in dihydroaspidospermatidine (XXI) have been showngo to occur at m/e 199 and 227, the latter having twice the intensity of the former. These peaks appear in the spectrum of (XX) at m/e 257.12921 (CtsHt7N202+) and 28516019 (C17H2tN20z+, fragment o; accompauied by b, m/e 243) with the same relative intensities as found in the case of (XXI).The absolute co~~tion of alkaloids of the ~pidos~~atidine group has been related to their ORD c~rves.~~ The negative sign of the main Cotton effect (below 290 nm) of (f)-12-hydroxy-Ar-acetylaspidospennatidine (XVI) is indicative of C-6 alpha at C-7 as in (+)-limatine (XIX)2q* 31 (see Ref.
