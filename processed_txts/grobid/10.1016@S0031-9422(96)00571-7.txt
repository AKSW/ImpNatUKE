INTRODUCTIONRecently, we have described the isolation and identification of three limonoids, methyl lct,6,8ct,14fl,30flpentahydroxy-3-oxo[3.3.1 ~0,2.1 L4]_tricyclomehac.7_oate; methyl 1 ~t,2fl,3ct,6,8ct, 14fl-hexahydroxy-[4.2.1 ~0.a0.1 ~.4]_ tricyclomeliac-7-oate and methyl l~-acetoxy-2fl,3~,6, 8~, 14fl-pentahydroxy-[4.2.1 ~0.30.1 l"4]-tricyclomeliac-7oate from the stem of Khaya senegalensis [1]. The last two compounds represent a novel group of methyl tricyclomeliac-7-oates.The isolation of this interesting group of new compounds, combined with our taxonomic interest in the Meliaceae, stimulated an investigation of the leaves of K. senegalensis. Two new limonoids (1, 2) have now been isolated along with the known scopoletin, /3quercitrin and rutin [2][3][4].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe limonoid 1 showed spectral characteristics (Tables 1 and2) close to those of methyl l~t-acetoxy-2fl,3a,6,8ct-14fl-pentahydroxy-[4.2.110,30.1 L4]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate (3) [1]. The principal change observed in the ~3C NMR spectrum (Table 2) of compound 1 was the replacement of the resonance for an oxymethine by a signal of a ketal (or hemiketal) carbon (6 104.9). The ~H (Table 1) and ~3C NMR showed the * Based in part on the Ph.D. thesis presented by L.R.V.O. to PPGQ-UFSCar.t Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.existence of two methoxyl groups (6c 52.6 and 50.4; 3r~ 3.78 s and 3.33 s). The signal for H-3 at di 3.48 showed one-bond correlation (HMQC) with the 13C signal at ~ 82.4 and was coupled only to the ~H signal of a hydroxyl group (t5 2.86, D20 exch.). In the same way, the signal for H-30 was visible as a singlet at 3 3.29 and showed cross peaks with the ~3C signal at 68.8 (~J). Thus, the deshielded resonances observed here, when compared with compound 3, required the presence of an acyclic hemiketal involving a tertiary hydroxyl and methoxyl functions at C-2 or a cyclic ketal formed by joining C-2 to O-14 and methoxyl group at C-2. The cyclic nature of the ketal function was apparent from the significant downfield shifts for C-14 (1: fi 83.4; 3:6 81.5) and C-15 (1: ~ 35.8; 3: 32.0) in the ~3C NMR spectrum, when compared with 3. The correct one was also decided on the basis of the J3C NMR spectrum, by means of isotope shifts [5] observed in the H20/D20 experiment, which did not show any significant effect at C- . This was supported by the HMBC (Table 3) spectrum which showed correlations from H-3, H-30 (2j) and -OMe (6 3.33, 3j) to the C-2 signal at 6 104.9. The NOESY (Table 4) experiments showed correlations of H-3 with H3-28 and H-29b, and of 3-OH with H-5, requiring H-3 on the or-side and 3-OH on the fl-side of the molecule.

Significant upfield shifts for C-2 and C-29 in the ~3C NMR spectrum, when compared with 4 and its l~,6-diacetoxy derivative 4a [1], determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-1. Thus, the structure of the new limonoid was characterized as methyl 1 ~-acetoxy-6,8~, 14fl,30fl-tetrahydroxy-3-oxo-[3.3.11o.2.1 ~'4]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate (2).In biogenetic terms, a pinacol pinacolone rearrangement of a 2,3,30-trihydroxy-l,29-cyclo-meliacate precursor may have occurred, resulting in a 2-oxo-tricyclo-[4.2.1 ~0,30.1 ~:]-decane. Subsequent reduction or addition of an hydroxyl group at C-14 to ketone and O-2-methylation may have led to the limonoids 3 and 1, respectively. Plant material.
