Mycoleptones A-C and Polyketides from the Endophyte Mycoleptodiscus indicus
Three new azaphilones with an unusual methylene bridge, named mycoleptones A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5), were isolated from cultures of Mycoleptodiscus indicus, a fungus associated with the South American medicinal plant Borreria verticillata. Additionally, four known polyketides, austdiol (1), eugenitin (3), 6-methoxyeugenin (6), and 9hydroxyeugenin (7), were also isolated. The structural characterization of compounds was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy, timedependent density functional theory calculations, and X-ray crystallography. Compounds 1-9 were weakly active when tested in antileishmanial and cytotoxicity assays.

E ndophytic microorganisms live inside the tissues of host plants without apparently harming them and are a promising source of bioactive compounds. [1][2][3][4] Species of Mycoleptodiscus, such as M. indicus, M. terrestris, and M. sphericus, are commonly isolated as endophytes; they are probably latently phytopathogenic and may become phytopathogenic when the host plant is subjected to stress. 5 M. indicus, a tropical to subtropical species, occurs in leaves of different host plants, mainly monocotyledons. M. indicus is associated with large spreading lesions on leaves of Zamia spp., an American cycad, and other monocotyledonous plants. 6 M. indicus has occasionally been reported to infect humans and canines, causing septic arthritis and skin infections. 7 In this paper, the isolation, structural characterization, and biological activity of secondary metabolites from cultures of M. indicus, an endophytic fungus isolated from the leaves from Borreria verticillata (Rubiaceae), are reported. Three new azaphilones, named mycoleptones A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5), were isolated and fully characterized; in addition, four known polyketides, namely, austdiol (1), eugenitin (3), 6-methoxyeugenin (6), and 9-hydroxyeugenin (7), were isolated and identified, and the acetylated derivatives of austdiol (8) and mycoleptone A (9) were synthesized (Figure 1).
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSeven secondary metabolites of M. indicus were isolated, four of which were identified as austdiol, eugenitin, 6-methoxyeugenin, and 9-hydroxyeugenin by comparison of experimental spectroscopic data with literature values. [8][9][10][11][12][13] Austdiol ((7R,8S)-7,8dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-6-oxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-isochromene-5carbaldehyde) is the main toxic component of a mixture of compounds produced in moldy maize meal by Aspergillus ustus and belongs to a class of compounds known generically as azaphilones. 14,15 Azaphilones are yellow or orange pigments produced by fungi: their pyran oxygen atoms are easily exchanged to nitrogen atoms with ammonia, and the name is derived from the ready reaction of these metabolites with ammonia to yield vinylogous γ-pyridones. 16 The skeleton of austdiol is derived from a single pentaketide chain, composed of head-to-tail acetate units, and possesses two C 1 units introduced from S-adenosylmethionine. 17 A wide range of interesting biological activities of azaphilones, such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, cytotoxic, nematicidal, and anti-inflammatory, have been reported in the literature; 14,17 their nonselective biological activities may be related to the production of vinylogous γ-pyridones. 18 Three of the isolated metabolites are previously unreported azaphilones and were named mycoleptones A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5). Mycoleptone A (2) was isolated as a yellow powder, and the complete structural characterization was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, highresolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies (Figure 2). The UV spectrum of 2 displays maximum absorptions at 254 nm (log ε 2.90) and 361 nm (log ε 2.83), revealing the presence of an extended conjugated system, characteristic of azaphilones. Compound 2 displays similar 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra to austdiol, 8,9  The heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) spectrum shows key correlations of CH 2 -10 to C-4a, C-5, C-6, C-4a′, C-5′, and C-6′, revealing the attachment of two azaphilone units through a methylene bridge at position C-5 (Table 1). Furthermore, the presence of four hydroxyl groups was confirmed by acetylation with pyridine-Ac 2 O to afford the tetraacetylated derivative (9). NMR spectroscopy identifies the structure of 2 as being formed by two austdiol units linked by a methylene group, generating a compound with the molecular formula C 23 H 24 O 8 as determined by HRMS ([M + H] + at m/z 429.1543). The chemical structure explains the simplicity of the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra, in which the signal intensities are doubled, except for the methylene group.Compound 2 is a chiral molecule having four asymmetric carbons and a formal binary symmetry axis. An accurate analysis of the eight enantiomeric pairs of 2 reveals that two pairs are formed by nonoptically active meso structures and two more pairs are repeated twice; as a result, four pairs of enantiomers and two meso structures are possible. Since the reliable assessment of the absolute configuration of a compound is achieved when the theoretical chiroptical properties 19 of all the possible optically active diastereomers are determined, 20 quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations were performed on four diastereomers of 2 (Figure 3): (7R,8S,7′R,8′S)-2 (2A), (7R,8S,7′R,8′R)-2 (2B), (7R,8S,7′S,8′S)-2 (2C), and (7S,8S,7′S,8′S)-2 (2D). QM calculations were carried out  using density functional theory (DFT) and its time-dependent extension (TD-DFT); detailed results are reported in the Supporting Information. DFT geometry optimization (Table 2) yielded two equilibrium conformers having ΔE QM ≤ 2 kcal mol -1 for diastereomers 2A, 2B, and 2C, while a single equilibrium conformer within the same threshold energy was found for diastereomer 2D. The most populated conformers of 2A (Figure 4) display similar geometric features: the azaphilone units are oriented in an "open folder" conformation, the pyran oxygen atoms are pointing toward opposite directions, and all the hydroxy groups are equatorial and form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with each other and with the ketone carbonyl groups. The main difference lies in the direction of the axial methyl groups on C-7 and C-7′, which point outside the molecular cavity for 2A-e and inside for 2A-b.The experimental ECD spectrum of 2 in methanol (Figure 5) shows four bands. The broad positive band centered at 372 nm has a strong contribution from the n → π* transitions of the ketone carbonyls, which are affected by the chiral environment around these groups. The positive band at 311 nm with a shoulder around 285 nm, the sharp negative peak at 252 nm, and the positive peak at 228 nm are due to π → π* transitions of the conjugated system, which are affected by the chirality of the rings and by the mutual orientation of the azaphilone units. The theoretical ECD spectra of the diastereomers of 2 (Figure 6) displayed different patterns, reflecting their different stereochemistry. The comparison between the calculated spectrum of 2A and the experimental spectrum of 2 (Figure 7) shows that TD-DFT calculations are able to reproduce the experimental pattern of the transitions in the high-energy region, considering that transition energies are usually underestimated by PBE0. 21 The transitions in the lowenergy region are not reproduced, suggesting that QM calculations are unable to describe the chiral environment of the ketone moieties, in particular hydrogen-bonding interactions with hydroxy groups and solvent molecules, with adequate accuracy. On the other hand, the theoretical ECD spectra of the remaining diastereomers (reported in the Supporting Information) are unable to reproduce the experimental ECD pattern in the high-energy region: on this basis, a (7R,8S,7′R,8′S) absolute configuration can be predicted for 2.Compound 2 crystallizes with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 2); the X-ray geometric parameters selected for comparison with the precursor austdiol are listed in Table 3. The C-5-C-10 distance was elongated upon change of hybridization to sp 3 for atom C-10, and the C-5-C-4a distance was shortened, increasing the double-bond character. The pyran rings are almost planar with an rmsd from the mean plane of 0.03 Å, while the cyclohexenone rings adopt a twisted envelope conformation with atoms C-7 and C-7′ as flap atoms. The X-ray structure of 2 shows that the azaphilone units have the same absolute configuration as austdiol, 22 retaining the stereochemistry of the chiral centers as (7R,8S); moreover,          The presence of a methylene bridge is very uncommon among natural compounds, and only a few azaphilone dimers have been reported showing such a feature. 15 Dicitrinones A-C 23 were isolated from Penicillium citrinum, a volcano ashderived fungus: the presence of a single sp 3 carbon bridge, either a methine or methylene group, was proposed to derive from the carboxyl group of citrinin through decarboxylation, reduction, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation mediated by a polyketide biosynthetic pathway. The methylene bridge in aspergilone B, 24 an azaphilone dimer that was isolated from a marine-derived fungus of the Aspergillus species, was hypothesized to derive from a formaldehyde biosynthetic pathway; the same hypothesis was proposed for the biosynthesis of xyloketal F, 25 a dimer isolated from a mangrove fungus of the Xylaria species.The condensation of two austdiol units to form mycoleptone A ( 2) is consistent with a possible biosynthetic pathway similar to the one proposed for dicitrinone C 23 (Figure 8). One austdiol unit may undergo decarbonylation, while the aldehyde group of the second austdiol unit may be reduced to a reactive carbocation species: the two units may then react by Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Similar pathways may also explain the condensation of the dihydroisocoumarin and chromone units with an austdiol unit in mycoleptones B (4) and C (5), respectively. Due to the limited number of methylene-bridged azaphilones discovered to date, however, a general biosynthetic pathway cannot be postulated, and the biologically mediated mechanisms of such reactions are unknown.The results of antileishmanial and cytotoxicity tests on the isolated compounds are shown in Table 4. Compounds 1-9 exhibit no significant activity against Leishmania donovani and Leishmania major compared to the standard antileishmanial drugs Geneticin (L. major), amphotericin B, and pentamidin (L. donovani). Mycoleptone B (4) was the most cytotoxic metabolite (PC3 cells: IC 50 = 7.1 ± 3.8 μM), but its activity was lower than that of doxorubicin, the reference compound for cytotoxicity assays.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONGeneral Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured in CHCl 3 , MeOH, or DMSO using a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter at room temperature; IR spectra were recorded with KBr discs using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer. UV spectra were measured in CHCl 3 , MeOH, and DMSO on a Varian Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu SCL-10Avp multisolvent delivery system, a SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector, an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection, and processing, and a Shim-pack CLC-ODS(M) reversed-phase column (250 × 4.5 mm i.d.; 5 μm particle size) protected by a Pelliguard LC-18 cartridge. The NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 1 H NMR and 100 MHz for 13 C NMR in CDCl 3 , CD 3 OD, or DMSO-d 6 ; multiplicity determinations (DEPT) and 2D NMR spectra (COSY, HMQC, and HMBC) were obtained using standard Bruker pulse programs. The chemical shift values (δ) are given in parts per million (ppm), and the coupling constants are in Hz. HRMS were obtained by direct injection using a Bruker Bioapex FTMS spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI). UV and ECD spectra of 2 in MeOH (sample concentration: 19 μM) were recorded in the 500-215 nm spectral range on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter, using a 1 cm path length cell at room temperature: measurements  were carried out at 0.2 nm intervals using a 1 nm spectral bandwidth, a 20 nm min -1 scan rate, and a 4 s time constant. Fungal Material. The fungus was isolated as an endophyte from the medicinal plant Borreria verticillata (L.) G. F. W. Meyer, belonging to the Rubiaceae family, and is native to South America. Five specimens of B. verticillata with a healthy appearance were collected from the campus of the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) (34°56′57″ W; 8°2′53″ S) in January 2006, approximately 43 cm in height and bearing flowers. Then, the samples were taken to the laboratory and processed in 24 h. A voucher specimen of the plant (No. 42.234/UFPE) was identified and deposited at the Herbarium Professor Geraldo Mariz, UFP, Department of Botany, UFPE, Recife, Brazil. The isolate was identified as Mycoleptodiscus indicus based on sequence analysis of the ITS region of the rDNA (GenBank accession number GU220382.1).Cultivation, Extraction, and Isolation. M. indicus was grown on potato dextrose agar plates for 7 days at 30 °C. Then, 10 plugs were transferred to five Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL), each containing 100 mL of potato dextrose broth prepared with distilled water. Flasks were shaken on a rotary shaker at 30 °C and 120 rpm for 48 h. Next, 10 mL was transferred to each of 50 flasks containing 90 g of solid medium (rice-oat). These were grown for 30 days. On day 30, the mycelial mass was macerated with ethanol overnight and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to obtain a crude ethanol extract (22 g), which was partitioned with three times equal volumes of hexane and CH 2 Cl 2 , respectively, yielding hexane (6 g) and dichloromethane fractions (6.9 g). The CH 2 Cl 2 fraction was suspended in MeOH and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min, furnishing a precipitate fraction (3870 mg) and a soluble fraction (3030 mg). The precipitate fraction was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (30 × 3.5 cm i.d.) using a MeOH-CH 2 Cl 2 gradient to yield 67 fractions, which were combined on the basis of their TLC profiles into seven fractions: A (19 mg), B (33 mg), C (2968 mg), D (100 mg), E (210 mg), F (285 mg), and G (109 mg). Fraction C (2968 mg) yielded austdiol (2830 mg), after crystallization in MeOH, and fraction E afforded mycoleptone A (2, 200 mg) by precipitation. The soluble fraction (3030 mg) was subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex LH-20 column (50 × 3 cm i.d.) using MeOH as the mobile phase, furnishing 10 fractions (S1-S10). Fraction S6 (280 mg) was washed with MeOH, yielding eugenitin (50 mg). The soluble portion was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (25 × 2 cm i.d.) using a MeOH-CH 2 Cl 2 gradient. Forty-two fractions were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC profiles to yield nine fractions. The fourth fraction (S6.4, 28 mg) was purified by preparative silica gel TLC using hexane-ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v) as eluent to furnish mycoleptone B (4, 10 mg) and mycoleptone C (5, 2 mg). Fraction S5 (461 mg) was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (25 × 2 cm i.d.) eluted with a gradient of MeOH in CH 2 Cl 2 . Thirty fractions were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC profiles to yield 10 fractions. The fourth fraction (S5.4, 60 mg) was purified by preparative silica gel TLC using hexane-ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v) as eluent to provide 6-methoxyeugenin (14 mg). The fifth fraction (S5.5, 4 mg) was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using CH 3 CN-H 2 O (10:90 to 100:0, v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min over 23 min, yielding 9-hydroxyeugenin (2 mg).Acetylation of Austdiol and Mycoleptone A (2). A solution containing austdiol (80 mg), pyridine (2 mL), and Ac 2 O (3 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. H 2 O (6 mL) was added into the reaction mixture, which was subsequently extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 . The organic layer was evaporated to give a yellow, amorphous solid (140 mg), which was purified by preparative TLC eluted with a mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH (98:2, v/v) to afford the diacetylated derivative (8, 80.7 mg). Acetylation of mycoleptone A (2, 25 mg) was performed in a similar manner, yielding the tetraacetylated derivative (9, 20 mg).Quantum-Mechanical Calculations. Conformational analysis on the selected diastereomers of 2 was performed in two steps. In the first step, a preliminary conformer distribution was determined by molecular mechanics (MM) calculations at the MMFF94s 26 level using the Spartan'02 software. 27 In the second step, DFT 28,29 geometry optimizations were performed on the MM conformers having relative energies (ΔE MM ) within a threshold value of 3 kcal mol -1 . DFT calculations were carried out at the B97D/6-311+ +G(2d,2p) level [30][31][32][33] using the Gaussian 09 software package. 34 The Boltzmann distribution of conformers at 298.15 K and 1 atm was then calculated from the relative electronic energies (ΔE QM ). TD-DFT 35 calculations were carried out at the PBE0/6-311++G(2d,2p) level [31][32][33][36][37][38] using the Gaussian 09 software package. 34 All calculations were performed using the IEFPCM continuum solvation model 39,40 for MeOH. Rotational strengths (R j ) and excitation wavelengths (λ j ) were calculated for the lowest 50 excited states on the optimized geometries having ΔE QM ≤ 2 kcal mol -1 . Theoretical ECD spectra were then obtained by approximation of R j values to Gaussian functions with a half-bandwidth at Δε max /e (Δσ) of 0.3 eV, summation over all excited states, and conformational averaging, according to the Boltzmann distribution of conformers (χ QM ). 41 Crystallographic Structure. Crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by crystallization from a methanol solution. A colorless prismatic crystal of approximate dimensions 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm 3 was used for the experiment. X-ray data were measured on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer employing graphite-monochromated Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 298 K and operating in the φ-ω scan mode.  3 , F(000) = 452, and μ(Cu Kα) = 0.86 mm -1 . All tested crystal samples showed gemination, and the sample used for data collection was visually homogeneous, but it showed pseudomerohedral twinning, which caused partial superposition of structure factors leading to high residuals during the structure refinements. A total of 8384 reflections were collected (4273 unique plus 96.2% of Friedel mates) in the θ range 4.56°to 73.92°and index ranges h from 15 to -15, k from -24 to 25, and l from -15 to 15. Cell refinement and data reduction were performed with the XCAD4 software suite. The structure was solved and refined using the WingX with SHELX97 suite. 42,43 Structure refinement was performed on F 2 by full-matrix least-squares calculations. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and all hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized coordinates and refined as riding atoms with isotropic parameters relative to their parent atoms. The final refinement residuals were R 1 = 0.091 (wR 2 = 0.32) for 6964 observed reflections with I > 2σ(I), 575 variable parameters, and three restraints, being R 1 = 0.11 (wR 2 = 0.32) for all unique reflections with GoF = 1.41. The absolute structure Flack parameter was 0.1(3), indicating that the chiral sense was correctly chosen, although this number was not reliable, given the large standard deviation, in the absence of strong anomalous scatterers.Biological Assays. The microplate Alamar-Blue assay was used to determine growth inhibition against L. donovani. 44 Antileishmanial (L. major) and cytotoxicity assays against human colon cancer (HCT-8) cells, human leukemia cancer (HL-60) cells, human melanoma cancer (MDA-MB435) cells, human prostate cancer (PC3) cells, human glioblastoma cancer (SF-95) cells, and human lymphocyte cells were assessed employing a colorimetric method. 45 Austdiol with the replacement of the aldehyde signals (δ H 9.99 and δ C 189.3) by methylene signals (δ H 3.26 and δ C 18.5) at position C-5. The 1 H NMR spectrum exhibits two signals at δ H 7.30 and 6.25 due to hydrogen atoms on the pyran ring, two hydroxyl hydrogens at δ H 5.66 (OH, d, J = 4.6 Hz) and 4.93 (OH, s), a methine signal at δ H 4.22 (1H, d, J = 4.6 Hz), a methylene signal at δ H 3.26, and two methyl signals at δ H 2.07 and 0.91. The 13 C NMR spectrum displays signals for 12 carbons atoms, 11 of which refer to two atoms each: two signals due to methyl carbon atoms (δ C 19.2 and 18.8), five signals from the skeleton of the pyran rings (δ C 157.8; 143.5; 141.0; 120.7 and 104.6), and four signals from the skeleton of the cyclohexenone, with one signal due to ketone carbonyl groups (δ C 197.8; IR ν max 1667 cm -1 ), one due to quaternary unsaturated carbon atoms (δ C 112.7), and two due to oxygenated carbon atoms (δ C 75.6 and 71.0). The remaining signal refers to a methylene group (δ C 18.5).

and 11 signals belonging to the dihydroisocoumarin moiety. The13  C NMR data reveal six resonances for sp2  carbon atoms being part of a benzene ring, two of them characterized by a downfield shift due to the hydroxy substituents (C-6′ at δ C 160.2; C-8′ at δ C 160.9) and the presence of a carbonyl group at δ C 171.2 (C-1′; IR ν max 1652 cm -1 ). The structural features of the lactone ring were determined from the 1 H-1 H COSY spectrum based on the couplings between H 2 -4′ and H-3′, as well as between H-3′ and H 3 -9′. The HMBC correlations of CH 2 -4′ to δ C 136.8 (C-5′), δ C 100.1 (C-8a′), δ C 75.0 (C-3′), and δ C 19.6 (C-9′) proved the connection of the two units. In addition, the HMBC spectrum displays relevant correlations from CH 2 -10 (δ H 3.60, 3.53) to δ C 199.3 (C-6), 143.7 (C-4a), and 112.8 (C-5) from the azaphilone moiety and to δ C 160.9 (C-8′), 160.2 (C-6′), and 116.5 (C-7′) from the dihydroisocoumarin moiety, characterizing the connection between the two units by a methylene bridge to afford the compound (7R,8S)-5-[(6′,8′-dihydroxy-3′,5′-dimethyl-1′-oxoisochroman-7′-yl)methyl]-7,8-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-isochromen-6-one. The molecular formula of mycoleptone C (5) was deduced as C 23 H 22 O 8 by HRMS analysis in combination with 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopies. The 1 H NMR spectrum displays nine singlets and two doublets; as in compounds 2 and 4, the methylene group at δ H 3.74 (1H, d, J = 15.0 Hz) and 3.46 (1H, d, J = 15.0 Hz) connects two moieties, the azaphilone and chromone units. The azaphilone moiety shows five uncoupled hydrogen atoms at δ H 7.52 (H-1), 7.03 (H-4), 4.25 (H-8), 2.25 (H-9), and 1.00 (H-10); the chromone moiety displays four uncoupled hydrogen atoms at δ H 13.06 (H-5′), 6.13 (H-3′), 2.37 (H-9′), and 2.00 (H-10′), the sharp singlet at δ H 13.06 being interpreted as a hydrogen-bonded phenol hydroxy group. The 13 C NMR spectrum confirms 23 carbon signals, namely, four methyl, one methylene, four methine, and 14 quaternary carbon signals. The chromone moiety displays one ketone carbonyl group (δ C 181.8; IR ν max 1690 cm -1 ) and four quaternary aromatic (δ C 153.5, 107.8, 105.0, and 103.1), two oxygenated aromatic (δ C 161.1 and 156.6), two unsaturated (δ C 167.2 and 107.9), and two methyl (δ C 20.2 and 8.5) carbon atoms. The structure of the chromone portion was determined on consideration of the molecular formula, double-bond equivalents, and the downfield shifts of the carbon signals at C-2′ and C-8a′ (δ C 167.2 and 153.5). The HMBC spectrum of 5 revealed relevant correlations of CH 2 -10 (δ H 3.74, 3.46) to δ C 200.5 (C-6), 144.3 (C-4a), and 112.1 (C-5) from the azaphilone moiety and to δ C 161.1 (C-7′), 156.6 (C-5′), and 107.8 (C-6′) from the chromone moiety, revealing the
