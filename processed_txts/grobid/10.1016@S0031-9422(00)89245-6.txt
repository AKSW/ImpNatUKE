NEOLIGNANS FROM NECTANDRA MIRANDA"
INTRODUCllONThe biosynthesis of the guianin (4) [2,3] and burchellin (Sa) [3][4][5][6] type neolignans of Aniba species involves, presumably, the oxidative coupling of propenyl-and allylphenols, either by radical pairing (1 + 2) [7] or through ionic intermediates. It sulKces to postulate the existence of the allylphenol derived intermediate in a mesomeric form to rationalize the formation (1 + 3) of macrophyllin (6) [S] and to justify the expectation that the alternative type 7 also should be represented in nature. This is indeed the case and we now report that Nectandra miranda, Lauraceac, contains the mirandins A (7a) and B (7b).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3a-Methoxybenzofuranoid neolignansThe mirandins A and B were recognized as neolignans by their formulae, CisH,.,02(0Me),, and spectra; the similar 'H-NMR and MS (m/e 208, 100%) clearly pointing in both cases to partial structure 8 with the Ar and Me groups in a trans-relationship [4]. The additional C,.C,-unit must be represented by a cyclohexadienone [v_ (cm-') mirandin A 1666 ; mirandin B 16801 linked at the sole and fully substituted sp3-C to a methoxyl (r mirandin A 7.00; mirandin B 6.88) and at a spz-C to an ally1 group, as in 7. The ally1 can, indeed, be located only on a spa-C, the doubly allylic 1 On leave of absence from Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil. 6.89 ; mirandin B 6.84, both d, J = 7.0 Hz). Among the 3 possible sites, C-7 and C-4 are incompatible with the representation of the ring olefinic protons by MR singlets and the biosynthesis which requires the ally1 group to be para-related with an oxy-function.Since both compounds are represented by formula 7, they must differ in the orientation of the aliphatic methoxyl. Indeed, the conspicuous differences in the 'H-NMR spectra, all refer to signals attributed to protons of the immediate vicinity of C-3a. Most significantly, the H-3 signal of mirandin-A appears 0.49 ppm downfield from the H-3 signal of mirandin-B. This seems to indicate association of H-3 to OMe-3a in mirandin-A (7a), in contradistinction to the truns relation of H-3/OMe-3a in mirandin-B (7b). Indeed the analogous association is apparent in the 'H-NMR spectrum of 2-epi-mirandin-A (7c), the product of isomerization by acid of 7a. Comparison of the three spectra reveals additionally the expected relative shielding of methoxyl only in the 2,3a-cis-derivative 7a (Table 1).Photolysis or pyrolysis of mirandin-A leads to 9, a compound which was obtained previously by pyrolysis of the naturally occurring 10 [S], and identified inclusively with respect to stereochemistry. Thus, 7a registers the absolute configuration of mirandin-A.In solution, the aryl and cyclodienone moieties of   with the dihedral angle approaching 180" (JH_-Z.H_-J = 9.5 Hz). The Cotton effects associated with the two chromophones are of opposite signal in the region of benxenoid (300 nm) and enone (280nm) absorptions (Table 2), and cause a well resolved ORD curve. Correlation of the signal of these Cotton effects with aryl and methoxyl (8) (11) n fully substituted spw, configuration was effected by analysis of the ORD curve of 2-epi-mirandin-A (7~). This was derived from mirandin-A (7a) by epimerixation only of C-2. In consequence, no doubt exists concerning the (2R)configuration, associated with a negative Cotton effect in the 310 nm region, the (3aS)-conflguration, associated with a positive Cotton effect around 280nm, and the (3!+cotiguration of its chiral centres. Mirandin-B, which causes a positive Cotton effect in the 310nm region and a negative Cotton effect in the 280nm region, must consequently possess the absolute configuration registered in 7b.Configuration and conformation of the mirandins are also discussed in a paper on the '%-NMR spectra of neolignans [9].

The Cotton effects associated wtth the benzenoid and enone chromophores are both positive and cause an unresolved ORD curve between 250-310 nm.
