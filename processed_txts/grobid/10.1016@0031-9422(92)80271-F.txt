DAMMARANE AND CYCLOARTANE TRITERPENOIDS FROM THREE RAPANEA SPECIES
An investigation of three species of burner, R. u~e~lata, R. lanc~~~u and R. guyuuensis, has led to the identification of three terpeno-~-hydroxy~nzoic acids, 3-geranyl-4-hydroxy-5~~,~-~methyl~lyl)-~nzoi~ acid; S-carboxy-7-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-2-(l'-hydroxy-l',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenan and 6-carboxy& (3",3"-dimethyiaUy1)-3a-hydroxy-2a-methy1-2-~~-methy1~n~-3'-eny1)-3,4-dihydrobenzop~an and two triterpenoids which appear to be novel. The two new compounds were identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis as 24(E) -3oxo-dammara-2~,2~dien-26-~ and 2qE)-3a-hydroxycy~lo~-24-en-26-~.

IhTRODWCTIONThe family Myrsina~ae has usually been considered to contain about 33 genera and nearly 1000 species. This plant family is characterized by the presence of a group of 3,6-dihydroxy-2-alkylbenzoquinones and a number of triterpenoids based on the oleananeiursane skeleton [l-5]. However, many of the species are little known chemically.Recently, we have described the isolation and identification of 3-geranyl-4-hydroxy-5-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)benzoic acid, S-carboxy-7-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-2-(l'-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'=enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran and 6-~boxy-8-(~',~~imethyl~lyl)-3a~ hydroxy-2a-me~yl-2-(~-methyl~nt-~-~yl~3,~dihydrobenzopyran from the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of Myrsinaceae species Rapanea umbeilata Mez. (syn. Myrsine umbellata Mart.) [6]. The three acids were purified as their methyl esters. These compounds represented a novel group of ter~no-p-hydroxy~nzoic acids.The isolation of this interesting group of new compounds combined with our taxonomic interest in the Myrsinaceae stimulated an investigation of other organs of R. umbellata and other plants of the Rapanea genus, i.e.
R. l~c~liaMez. (syn. Myrsine ~~c~~ia Mart) and R. ~uya~~is Albi. (syn. ~yrsi~ ~uya~~is Kuntze). Two new triterpenoids (I, 2) have now been isolated along with three known terpeno-phydroxybenzoic acids C61.
BESUL'IS AND DISCUSSIONIn a continuation of our investigation of the leaves of R. umbellata, we have isolated from the petrol extract a single triterpenoid derivative (1).Compound 1, C30H4602 (MS), gave rise to an IR spectrum which indicated the presence of a terminal methylene (888 cm-"), a carbonyl (1707 cm-') and an a&unsaturated carbonyl (X653 cm-') as functional It is well known that the signal of a &olefinic proton cis (66.4) to the aldehyde group is significantly more deshielded than the trans (66.1) [7]. Therefore, the downfield shift of the signal of the fl-oletiic proton in the 'H NMR spectrum clearly suggested the E-configuration of the double bond. The ident~cation of the nucleus as a dammarane was supported by the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which agreed closely with published data for cabraleone (3) and dammaradienol(4) [8,9]. The signal of the C-27 methyl (6 10.0) supported the E-configuration of the double bond as it is shielded by the steric interaction with the C-23 methylene [lo]. The new natural product is, therefore, 24(E)-3-oxodammara-20,24-dien-26-al(1).The dichloromethane extract of the stem and fruits of R. umbellata and leaves of R. lancifolia, gave 3geranyl-4-hydroxy-S-(3",3''-dimethylallyl)-~nzoic acid and 5-carboxy-7~~,3"-~methylallyl)-2-(l'-hydroxyl',S-dimethylhex-~-enyl)-2,3-dihydro~~ofuran.The two acids were methylated with diazomethane prior to anaIysis. They were identified by comparison with authentic samples and published data [6].From the petrol extract of the leaves of R. guy~nensjs, four #mpounds were obtained. Three were characterized as S-~rboxy-7~~',~-dimethylallyl~2-( l'-hydroxy-l',S'-dimethyIhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran and 6carboxy-8-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-3a-hydroxy-2a-me~hyl-2-(4'-methylpent-3'-enyl)-3,4_dihydrobenzopyran and phytol by comparison with published data and authentic samples [6, 11-j.The fourth compound (2) showed the spectral characteristics of a viny& methyl and a trans a&unsaturated In addition, the 'H NMR showed signals for a secondary hydroxyl (63.45, br s, H-3/?) and a cyclopropane methylene (Table 1). The ' 3C NMR spectrum (Table 2) revealed resonances for C-l to C-22 in close agreement with those for isomangiferolic acid ( 5 If the same enzymes catalyse allylic oxidation in both triterpenoids 1 and 2, some connection between R. umhellata and R. guyanensis can be anticipated. This appears to be the first record of dammarane/cycloartane triterpenoids from the Myrsinaceae. We do not know how widely the characteristic Rapanea compounds occur elsewhere in the family as many of the species are little known chemically. It is, therefore, premature to draw any conclusions about the link among Rapanea and its supposed allies in the Myrsinaceae.  of extract. The same treatment as for the stem extract gave 5-carbomethoxy-7-(3",3"-dimethylallyl)-2-(l'-hydroxy-1',5'dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3dihydrobenzofuran (500 mg). Extraction and isolation from leaves of R. lancifolia. Ground leaves (138 g) were extracted with CH,Cl, to give 4.0 g of extract.The same treatment as for the stem extract of R. umbellata, gave. 5-carbomethoxy-7~3",3"-dimethylallyl)-2-(l'-hydroxy-1',Sdimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (30 mg). Extraction and isolation from leaves of R. guyanensis. Ground leaves (719 g) were extracted with petrol to give 10.0 g of extract.The same treatment as for the leaves extract of R. umbellata, gave phytol, 2 (31 mg), 5_carbomethoxy-7-(3",3''-dimethylallyl)-2-(lf-hydroxy-l',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenran (165 mg) and finally 6-carbomethoxy-8-(3",3''-dimethylallyl)b-hydroxy-2a-methyI-2-(4'-methylpent-3'-enyl)-3,4-dihydrobenzopyran (3 mg).Compound 2 was purified by prep. TLC on silica gel using a soln of CH,Cl,-EtOAc (19: 1). Terpeno-p-hydroxybenzoic acids were methylated as above prior to analysis. Both were purified by the usual prep. TLC procedure (CH,Cl,-EtOAc, 1: 1).

A significant fragment at m/z 315 [CZZH3JOJ" for the tetracyclic nucleus required the presence of the terminal methylene at C-21 and -CHO at C-26 or C-27 of the C-17 sidechain. This was corroborated by the fragment m/z 123 [C,H,,O]+.

The mass spectrum gave significant fragments for m/r 315 [CZZH350]+ and 125 [CsH130]+ requiring the presence of -CH=CMeCHO in the sidechain. The structure of the new natural product is therefore 24(E)-3~ hydroxycycloart-24-en-26-al (2). The corresponding C-3 epimer (63.23,3a-H; 66.47, H-24) has been reported from
