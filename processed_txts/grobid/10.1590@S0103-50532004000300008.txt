Aspects of chemosystematic of the tribe Protieae are discussed.

IntroductionThe Burseraceae has usually been considered to contain 21 genera and nearly 600 species. Engler (1931)  classified these genera into three tribes. 1 The Protieae consist of four genera exhibiting many morphological characters regarded as primitives. Three Protieae genera occur in tropical America and one in Asia. The following group the Boswellieae contain eight genera centred in Africa and Asia. In contrast, the Canarieae, represented by nine genera, appear more advanced in their morphology. This tribe is predominantly Paleotropical, therefore, two genera occur in South America. Later Lam (1932)  recognised these tribes but replaced the name Boswellieae by Bursereae. 2 Crepidospermum Hook. is a member of the Protieae and consists of five species distributed in the tropical South America. Swart in 1942 on morphological grounds described the genus Hemicrepidospermum to accommodate C. rhoifolium. 3 However, other aspects of their morphology have led Daly (1989) to consider Hemicrepidospermum a section of Crepidospermum; the two sections have three and two species, respectively. 4 The following tropical S. American genera of the Protieae, Tetragastris and Protium, have long been considered closely related, in fact, many specimens of each genus have been mistakenly referred to the other. 4 Garuga is the only representative of Asian Protieae and its morphology is easily recognisable. 4 Trattinnickia was also a member of the Protieae, however, morphological and anatomical evidence have led Daly (1989) to transfer it into the Canarieae and to propose a taxonomic position close to Dacryodes. 4 Within tribe Protieae phytochemical data were not available for Crepidospermam, Tetragastris, Trattinnickia and Dacryodes. As part of our chemosystematic interest in the Brazilian Burseraceae, we recently reported the phytochemical investigation of Crepidospermam rhoifolium Benth. and Tetragastris altissima (Aublet) Swart. 5 Thus, we have now examined the resin, stem bark and branches of Trattinnickia burserifolia Engl., T. rhoifolia var. willdenowii Engl. and Dacryodes hopkinsii Daly. 4 
Resulsts and Discussion
Chemical composition of the extractsA chloroform-soluble fraction of the resin of T. burserifolia afforded one new monoterpene (1), three new triterpenes (2-4) and the known ursanes, α-amyrenone, 6 αamyrin (5), 3-epi-α-amyrin, 3α,16β-dihydroxyurs-12-ene (6), 7 the oleananes β-amyrenone, 6 β-amyrin (7), 3-epi-βamyrin, 3α,16β-dihydroxyolean-12-ene (8), 7 the tirucallane acids 3α-hydroxytirucall-8,24-dien-21-oic, 8 3α-hydroxytirucall-7,24-dien-21-oic, 6 3-oxotirucall-8,24dien-21-oic, 8 and the dammaranes dammarenediol-II and 3α,20(S)-dihydroxydammar-24-ene. 5 The 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 1 showed signals for a terminal methylene (δ 5.08, br s, and 5.00, br s), two olefinic protons which were coupled to each other (δ 5.80, dd, J 10.1 and 1.0 Hz; 6.14, dd, J 10.1 and 2.5 Hz), two methyl doublet (δ 0.88, d, J 6.8 Hz; 0.86, d, J 6.8 Hz), an oxymethine (δ 5.57, dd, J 5.0 and 2.8 Hz), an aryl substituted methylene (δ 3.61, 2H, s) and five protons as a multiplet between δ 7.30 and 7.25, clearly indicating the presence of a phenyl group. From HMBC experiments the observed correlations between the methylene protons at δ 5.08 and 5.00 and the 13 C signals at δ 127.2 and 71.8, requiring the presence of a conjugated double bond and an allylic proton attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom. HSQC experiments showed correlations of terminal methylene and conjugated double bond protons (δ 5.80 and 6.14) with the 13 C signals at δ 115.4, 133.7 and 127.2, respectively. HSQC also permitted the assignment of the signal at δ 41.8 to aryl substituted methylene at δ 3.61, which showed cross peaks with the 13 C signals of the aromatic ring (C-1', C-2' and C-6') and carboxyl at δ 171.1, indicating a phenylacetoxyl substituent. This group must be connected allylic to terminal methylene, due to the observed downfield shifted proton signal at δ 5.57, which showed one-bond correlation with the 13 C signal at δ 71.8. These correlations resulted in the construction of a CH 2 =C[CH(R)OCOCH 2 Ph]CH=CHR system. The remaining unassigned 13 C signals accounted for 2 CH 3 , CH 2 and 2 CH, of which two methyls were coupled to a methine, suggesting the presence of a monoterpene pmenthane skeleton to be substituted with phenylacetoxyl. The identification of the nucleus as a p-menthane was supported by comparison of the 13 C NMR spectrum (Table 1) with those of 2(S)-hydroperoxy-4(R)-p-mentha-1(7),5diene (9) and 2(R)-hydroperoxy-4(R)-p-mentha-1(7),5diene (10) obtained from photooxygenation of (-)-(R)-αphellandrene. 9 Based on the 1 H and 13 C NMR data for 9 and 10, in compound 1 the resonances for H-2 (δ 5.57, dd, J 5.0 and 2.8 Hz) and C-4 (δ 37.8) were characteristic of 2(S)-4(R)-p-menthane derivative, but this has not been confirmed. Compound 1 is thus 2(S*)-phenylacetoxy-4(R*)-p-mentha-1 (7),5-diene.The two new triterpenes 2 and 3 showed a single spot on TLC in various solvent systems and attempts to separate this mixture into its constituents were not successful. They also showed the spectral characteristics of a phenylacetoxyl substituent. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of this mixture in addition to signals described above for phenylacetoxyl, revealed resonances for C-1 and H-1 to C-30 and H-30 in close agreement with those for α-amyrin (5) and β-amyrin (7), respectively 7,10 (Table 2). The downfield shift of the signals for C-3 (δ 81.4) and H-3 (δ 4.48) in the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra, when compared with 5 and 7, determined the position of the phenylacetoxyl at C-3 in both the compounds of the mixture. The phenylacetoxyl present at C-3β was evident by resonance at δ 4.48 with a large coupling constant (J 11.0 and 5. 1 Hz). The structure of the new natural products were thus established as 3βphenylacetoxyurs-12-ene (2) and 3β-phenylacetoxyolean-12-ene (3).The new triterpene 4 was identified on the basis of the following data. The 1 H NMR spectrum indicated the presence of three signals characteristics of protons attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom (δ 3.23, dd, J 10.4 and 5.8 Hz; 4.23, dd, J 11.1 and 5.2 Hz; 4.27, dd, J 8.7 and 3.2 Hz), one olefinic proton (δ 5.24, d, J 3.2 Hz), and eight methyl groups, six of them on quaternary carbons and two of them on a methine group, suggesting a urs-12-ene skeleton. From the HMBC experiments (Table 3) the observed correlations between the two methyl protons at δ 0.77 and 0.97 and the 13  signals at δ 59.9 (CH) and 44.3 (quaternary carbon) led to their assignments as C-18 and C-14, respectively. A fourth methyl proton at δ 1.20 (δ C 24.3) was attributed to H 3 -27 by its correlations with the C-13 (δ 141.3) and C-14 (δ 44.3) signals. The H 3 -27 signal also showed a cross-peak with the signal at δ 43.6, confirming a methyl group at C-8. In the same way, the unsubstituted C-15 emerged from the correlation between the H 3 -27 signal and the 13 C signal at δ 36.0 ( 3 J; CH 2 ), which showed one-bond correlation with the 1 H signal at δ 1.36 (m). This signal was coupled to the 1 H signal at δ 4.23 (dd, J 11.1 and 5.2 Hz), requiring the presence of a hydroxyl function at C-16. The coupling constants indicated that the hydroxyl group was attached β (equatorial) to C-16 and was coupled only to H 2 -15, indicating C-17 fully substituted. This was supported by the relationship of the H-16 (δ 4.23) signal to the 13 C signal at δ 21.9, which showed one-bond correlation with the methyl proton at δ 0.73, and long-range correlation with the 13 C signals for C-18, C-16 and at δ 38.5 (quaternary carbon) and 35.2 (CH 2 ). The signals at δ H 0.73, δ C 21.9, 38.5 and 35.2 were then assigned to H 3 -28, C-28, C-17 and C-22, respectively. A sixth methyl proton at δ 1.05 (δ 18.0) was attributed to H 3 -26 by its correlation with the C-9 and C-14. H 3 -26 signal also showed cross peaks with the 13 C signal at δ 43.6 (quaternary carbon) and 33.7 (CH 2 ), which were attributed to C-8 and C-7, respectively. A seventh methyl proton at δ H 0.82 (d, J 6.3 Hz; δ C 17.8) was attributed to H 3 -29 by its correlation with the C-18 signal. H 3 -29 signal also showed cross peaks with the 13 C signal at δ 39.1 (CH) and (or) 39.5 (CH), suggesting a methine for C-20, indicating a methyl group to be located at C-20 and confirming a urs-12-ene skeleton. Thus, the eighth methyl proton at δ H 0.91 (d, J 5.9 Hz; δ C 21.5) was attributed to H 3 -30. The signal for C-21 was established as δ 30.4 (CH 2 ; δ H 1.42 m, by HSQC) by the existence of a correlation between the H 3 -30 signal and this 13 C signal.The stereochemistry suggested for 4 was based on the biosynthesis of urs-12-enes. However, for C-3, C-11 and C-16 the stereochemistry were assigned by coupling constants and NOESY experiments. A model shows that, in compound 4, ring A is nearer to a chair conformation, in which H-3 and H-5 are on the α-side of the molecule. This was supported by NOESY experiments (Table 3), which showed correlation of the signal of H-3α (δ 3.23; OH-3β) with the signal of H-5α (δ 0.72 m, by HSQC). Moreover, the existence of a correlation from H-3 to H 3 -23 (δ 0.97) confirmed that Me-23 is in the α-configuration. In addition, the signal of H-11 (δ 4.27) showed cross-peaks with the signals of H 3 -25 (δ 1.06) and H 3 -26 (δ 1.05), suggesting a spatial proximity of H-11 to Me-25 and Me-26, which requires 11-OH to be in the α-configuration. The O] -, confirming the presence of hydroxyl groups and thus the molecular formula (C 30 H 50 O 3 ). Based in the above evidence the structure of this compound was thus established as 3β,16β,11α-trihydroxyurs-12-ene (4). The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13 C NMR spectrum (Table 4) with those of 3β,16βdihydroxyurs-12-ene (11) 7 and 3α,11α-dihydroxyurs-12ene (12). 10 In order to confirm of the assignments for 6a and 8a discussed below, 4 was acetylated. This reaction involved dehydration of C-11 alcohol and acetylation of the C-3 and C-16 hydroxyl groups to give 3β,16βdiacetoxyurs-9(11),12-diene (4a). The 1 H NMR spectrum of 4a revealed the downfield shift of the signals for H-3 (δ 4.51, dd, J 11.4 and 4.9 Hz) and H-16 (δ 5.46, dd, J 11.4 and 5.5 Hz). From the HMBC experiments (Table 3) the observed correlations between the two methyl protons at δ 0.88 and 0.90 and the 13 C signals at δ 79.5, 50.0 ( 3 J; CH), 36.8 ( 2 J; quaternary carbon), 27.1 ( 3 J, CH 3 ) and 15.7 ( 3 J, CH 3 ) led to their assignments as C-3, C-5, C-4, C-23 and C-24, respectively. The oxymethine proton at δ 4.51 showed long-range correlation with the 13 C signal at δ 170.0 and with the C-24 (δ 15.7) and C-23 (δ 27.1) signals, confirming this proton signal to H-3 and allowing the assignment of the signal at δ 170.0 to C-3 acetoxyl group. Moreover, the existence of correlations between H 3 -28 (δ 0.91) and the 13 C signals at δ 69.9 (CH), 57.8 (CH), 36.3 (quaternary carbon) and 34.4 (CH 2 ) led to their assignments as C-16, C-18, C-17 and C-22, respectively. Thus, the  13 C signal at δ 122.2 led to their assignments as H-18 and C-12. Thus, the second olefinic carbon at δ 114.6 was attributed to C-11. The ursa-9(11),12-diene system was also supported by the 13 C NMR spectrum which agreed closely with published data for 3β-acetoxyurs-9(11),12-diene (13). 10 In the HMBC experiments several other long-range correlations were observed, which also confirmed the attribution of all the 13 C signals of the molecule (Table 3 and4).Compounds 3α,16β-dihydroxyurs-12-ene (6) and 3α,16β-dihydroxyolean-12-ene (8) have previously been isolated from Canarium album. 7 In the present investigation the physical separation of these compounds was not achieved, even after acetylation with anhydride in pyridine, but the 13 C NMR data (Table 4) left no doubt that they were 3α,16β-diacetoxy derivatives 6a and 8a. The presence of urs-and olean-12-ene systems were indicated by the characteristic olefinic 13 C resonances at δ 125.3 and 137.5, 122.6 and 142.9, respectively. The latter 13 C signals were more intense than the former, indicating the olean-12-ene derivative as the major compound. In the same way, the intense olefinic 1 H signal at δ 5.26 (t, J 3.6 Hz) was then assigned to H-12 of oelan-12-ene, whereas δ 5.20 (t, J 3.6 Hz) to H-12 of urs-12-ene derivative. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra revealed the presence of two acetoxyl groups. The identification of the A-ring containing only 3α-acetoxyl group as substituent was supported by the coupling constants for H-3 (δ 4.63, t, J 2.7 Hz, 8a; 4.50, t, J 2.7 Hz, 6a) and 13 C NMR spectrum, which showed that the acetylation accentuated the α-effect (C-3, δ 78.1) and diminished the β-effect (C-2, δ 22.7; C-4, δ 36.3) when compared with published data for C-2 to C-4 in 6 and 8. Inspection of the 13 C NMR data of various hydroxy ursand olean-12-enes, revealed that introduction of a hydroxyl group only on D-and E-ring causes a significant alteration of the chemical shift of C-18 (δ 58.9, 5; 60.8, 6; 47.4, 7; 49.1, 8). 10 Although, in urs-and olean-12-enes containing 21β-, 21α-, 22α-and 22β-hydroxyl groups, the C-21 and C-22 resonate at δ 70.0 to 76.7. 10 In olen-12-enes containing 15α-or 16β-hydroxyl groups, these carbinyl carbons resonate at δ 65.9 to 68.2. 10 The coupling constants of 1 H signals of an oxymethine for 6a and 8a (δ 5.46, dd, J 11.9 and 5.0 Hz, 8a; 5.48, dd, J 11.9 and 5.0 Hz, 6a) indicated that the acetoxyl group would be attached equatorial to C-15 (α) or C-16 (β), thus the above compounds are excellent models. The presence of a hydroxyl group at C-15α has a pronounced effect on the olefinic carbon resonances. The chemical shift of C-12 and C-13 in 3β,15α-dihydroxyolean-12-ene appear at δ 123.0 and 146.1, respectively. The corresponding resonances for 3β,16β-dihydroxyolean-12-ene appear at δ 122.2 and 143.4, i.e. C-13 is shielded by ∆δ 2.7. 10 The shielded resonance observed for 8a (δ 122.6 and 142.9) is typical of 16β-hydroxyolean-12-ene, determining the position of the second acetoxyl group at C-16β. Although, no urs-12-ene containing a 15α-hydroxyl group appears to have been isolated so far. However, for the analogous structural situation in 3β-hydroxyoelan-12-en-27,28-dioic (C-13, δ 138.1) and 3β-hydroxyurs-en-27,28-dioic (C-13, δ 134.2) acids a similar shield is observed for C-13 in both systems [C-13, δ 145.1 (7) -138.1 = ∆δ 7.0; δ 139.3 (5) -134.2 = ∆δ 5.1]. 10 Placement of the acetoxyl group at C-16 received further support from acetylation of 4, which yielded 4a. In the 13 C NMR spectrum of 4a (Table 4) the signal for C-16 was observed at δ 69.9, in close agreement with the resonance for the corresponding carbon in 6a (δ 70.8) and 8a (δ 69.8). All the above data suggested that 6a was 3α,16β-diacetoxyurs-12-ene and 8a was 3α,16βdiacetoxyolean-12-ene.The 1 H NMR spectra of concentrated MeOH extracts of stem bark of T. burserifolia, branch and resin of T. rhoifolia, branch and resin of Dacryodes hopkinsii showed signals corresponding to triterpenes isolated from resin of T. burserifolia. Thus, only CH 2 Cl 2 -soluble fractions of these extracts were further examined by their 13 C NMR spectra which showed that the major triterpenes were in stem bark of T. burserifolia α-amyrin (5) and β-amyrin (7); in branch of T. rhoifolia α-amyrin (5), β-amyrin (7), 3-epiα-amyrin, 3-epi-β-amyrin, lupenone 11 and sitosterol; in 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm film thickness) capillary column with helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.6 mL min -1 . The temperature was programmed initially at 60 °C for 2 min, then increased with a rate of 3 °C min -1 to 240 °C. The injection was split and its temperature was 225 °C. The interface temperature was 250 °C. The chromatograph was coupled to a Shimadzu QP5000 mass selective detector at 70 eV; IR (BOMEN -Ft/IR). [α] D : Perkin Elmer 241 instrument; IR (KBr, BOMEN -Ft/IR); R-HPLC: Recycling High-Performance Liquid Chromatography on a model Shimadzu LC-6AD; the column used was a Shim-pack Prep-Sil (H), 250 mm X 20 mm, 5 mm particle size, 100 Å pore diameter; eluant: CHCl 3 ; flow rate: 8.0 mL min -1 and 5.0 mL min -1 ; detection (Shimadzu SPD-6AV): UV λ 254 nm.
Plant materialTrattinnickia burserifolia, T. rhoifolia and Dacryodes hopkinsii were collected from Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke, Amazonas, Brazil; vouchers (184.962, 178.219, 178.240, respectively) were deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto Nacional de Pesquisa da Amazônia (INPA), Manaus, AM.
Extraction and isolation from resin of T. burserifoliaThe resin was dissolved in CHCl 3 , filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The concentrated (60 g) was partitioned into CHCl 3 , MeOH and H 2 O soluble fractions. The concentrated CHCl 3 -soluble fraction was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel. Elution with a hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH gradient afforded 6 fractions (3 hexane-fractions, 1 hexane/CH 2 Cl 2 fraction, 1 CH 2 Cl 2 fraction and 1 MeOH fraction). The hexane fractions were combined in 2 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. The hexane-fraction 2-3 gave a mixture (12.6 g) of α-amyrin (5) and β-amyrin (7). The hexane-fraction 1 was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel eluting with a hexane-EtOAc gradient to afford a mixture of 5 and 7 (3 g) and fractions A, B and C. Fraction A was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-EtOAc gradient and finally with hexane-EtOAc (98:2) affording impure 1. Compound 1 was purified by R-HPLC (CHCl 3 ; detection UV λ 254 nm, flow rate: 8.0 mL min -1 ; see above) affording pure 1 at 1 first peak (2.4 mg). Fraction B was flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-EtOAc gradient yielding 32 fractions. These fractions were combined in 5 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. The 5 groups were monitored by 1 H NMR (200 MHz) and were examined only those which showed features of taxonomic interest. Group 2 (fractions B17-24) was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with benzene-CH 2 Cl 2 (9:1) and finally with hexane-EtOAc 95:5 affording a mixture (5 mg) of 2 and 3. Group 3 (fractions B25-27) was flash rechromatographed on silica gel eluting with hexane-EtOAc 95:5 yielding an amorphous solid which was purified by preparative TLC (silica gel; hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 -THF, 10:1.0:0.25) to yield a mixture (7.9 mg) of αand β-amyrenone. Group 4 (fraction B28) was purified three times by preparative TLC (silica gel; benzene) to yield 3epi-α-amyrin (8.4 mg). Group 5 (fractions B29-32) was flash rechromatographed on silica gel eluting with hexane-EtOAc 9:1 yielding 3-epi-β-amyrin (13 mg) after crystallization in hexane. Fraction C yielded a precipitate (458 mg) from which 80 mg were methylated with CH 2 N 2 yielding the corresponding methyl ester of 3αhydroxytirucall-8,24-dien-21-oic acid.Hexane/CH 2 Cl 2 fraction from the concentrated CHCl 3soluble fraction of resin was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel eluting with a hexane-EtOAc gradient to afford 42 fractions. These fractions were combined in 7 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. The 7 groups were monitored by 1 H NMR (200 MHz) and were examined only those which showed features of taxonomic interest. Group 3 (fractions G3D17-19) yielded a precipitate which was dissolved in Me 2 CO and kept in the refrigerator overnight. The residue was flash rechromatographed on silica gel eluting with hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH 20:5:1 yielding a mixture of 3α-hydroxytirucall-8,24-dien-21-oic acid and 3α-hydroxytirucall-7,24-dien-21-oic acid. The filtrate was evaporated and the residue was rechromatographed as above affording a mixture (160 mg) of α-amyrin (5) and β-amyrin (7) and 3α-hydroxytirucall-8,24-dien-21-oic acid (6.7 mg). Group 5 (fractions G5E28-37) was twice flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH 10:1:1 and finally with hexane-EtOAc (8:2) affording fraction G5E-X and 3-oxotirucall-8,24-dien-21-oic acid (16 mg) after crystallisation in hexane-Me 2 CO. Fraction G5E-X was acetylated with Ac 2 O-pyridine to give acetate derivatives which were subsequently purified by flash chromatography eluting with hexane-Me 2 CO 8:2 affording fraction G5E-Xa and fraction G5E-Xb. Fraction G5E-Xa was flash rechromatographed on silica gel eluting with benzene-EtOAc 95:5 to yield a mixture (102 mg) of 6a and 8a. Fraction G5E-Xb was rechromatographed as above to afford a mixture (4.4 mg) of C3-epimers 3-acetoxyldammarenediol-II and 3α-acetoxy-20(S)-hydroxydammar-24-ene.The MeOH fraction from the concentrated CHCl 3soluble fraction of resin was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel eluting with a hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient to afford 15 fractions. TheseC signals at δ 78.7 ( 3 J; CH by DEPT), 55.4 ( 3 J; CH), 39.3 ( 2 J; quaternary carbon), 28.4 ( 3 J for methyl at δ 0.97; CH 3 ) and 15.7 ( 3 J for methyl at δ 0.77; CH 3 ) led to their assignments as C-3, C-5, C-4, C-23 and C-24, respectively. Based on the HSQC experiments the signal at δ 0.77, 0.97 and 3.23 were then assigned to Me-24, Me-23 and H-3, respectively. The methyl proton at δ 1.06 (δ C 17.0) showed long-range correlation with the13  C signal for C-5 (δ 55.4), permitting the assignment of these signals to H 3 -25 and C-25, respectively. The signal for H 3 -25 also showed correlations with the13  C signals at 55.3 (CH), 40.9 (CH 2 ) and 38.1 (quaternary carbon), showing that these signals correspond to C-9, C-1 and C-10, respectively. The olefinic proton at δ 5.24 showed cross peaks with the C-9 signal (δ 55.3), and was coupled to the 1 H signal at δ 4.27, thus indicating a hydroxyl group to be located at C-11and a double bond at C-12. The late oxymethine proton showed one-bond correlation with the 13 C signal at δ 68.2 and long-range correlation with the 13 C signals at δ 141.3 and 129.2, allowing the assignment of these to C-11, C-13 and C-12, respectively. Moreover, the existence of correlations between H-12 and the 13 C

The 1 H NMR also showed an olefinic proton to be coupled to H-12 (δ 5.49, d, J 5.6Hz; 5.61 d, J 5.6 Hz,), thus indicating the second doublebond between C-9 and C-11. The olefinic proton signal atδ 5.49 was attributed to H-12 by its correlation with theC-18 (δ 57.8) signal. H-12 signal also showed cross peakswith the 13 C signal at δ 41.8 (quaternary carbon), whichwas attributed to C-14. In the same way, the olefinic protonsignal at δ 5.61 to H-11 emerged from the correlationsbetween the H 3 -25 and H-11 signals with the 13 C signals atδ 37.5, assigned to C-10. H-11 signal also showed crosspeaks with the 13 C signal at δ 42.2, which was attributed toC-8. Moreover, H 3 -25 showed cross peaks with the C-5signal (δ 50.0) and the 13 C signals at δ 153.1 and 35.9,leading to their assignments as C-9 and C-1, respectively.The signal for C-13 was established as 137.7 by the, 26-29C existence of a correlation between the H 3 -27 signal (δ 0.99) 4 1 1 1 2 4a b and this 13 C signal.
