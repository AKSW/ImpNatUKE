Cytotoxic Clerodane Diterpenes from Casearia rupestris
Four new clerodane diterpenes, casearupestrins A-D (1-4), were isolated from the leaves of Casearia rupestris. Compounds 1 and 4 were acetylated to yield 2,7-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin A ( 5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6). All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Casearupestrin A (1) exhibited the most potent activity against MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma) and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) cells, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin.

b S Supporting Information T he tropical genus Casearia (Salicaceae sensu lato) contains ca. 180 species, 1 and it is a rich source of clerodane-type diterpenes. [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] The genus occurs widely in Brazil, where C. sylvestris is the most frequent species, occurring from the Amazon basin throughout the Cerrado (savanna) to the Atlantic Forest and Southern Brazil. The clerodanes are a group of diterpenoids with interesting biological effects such as antifungal, 14 antileishmanial and antiplasmodial, 15 antimalarial and antimycobacterial, 16 antitumor, 17,18 cytotoxic, 1,14,16,[19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31] immunomodulatory, 32 and trypanocidal activities. 33 In our continuing investigation of the bioactive clerodane diterpenes from Casearia species, we undertook the first phytochemical investigation of Casearia rupestris Eichler. This shrub or small tree grows up to 6.0 m in height and is found in Brazil (Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais States) and Bolivia (Sta. Cruz State) in the Cerrado, grasslands, and sometimes pastures, at altitudes of 350-500 m. 34 Investigation of the cytotoxic Et 2 O fraction yielded four new clerodane diterpenes (1-4) (Figure 1). Compounds 1 and 4 were acetylated, resulting in two new derivatives (5, 6) (Figure 1). The cytotoxic activity of the diterpenes (1-6) against a panel of human cancer cell lines (HL-60, MDA/MB-435, HCT-8, and SF-295) has been evaluated.
' RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONInvestigation of the Et 2 O phase of the EtOH extract of the leaves of C. rupestris led to the isolation of four new clerodane diterpenoids, casearupestrins A-D (1-4). 2,7-Di-O-acetylcasearupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6) were obtained by acetylation of compounds 1 and 4, respectively. The structures (Figure 1) of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and spectrometric data (IR, UV, NMR, and MS) and by comparison with NMR data of reported compounds. 6 Casearupestrin A (1) was obtained as a white, amorphous solid ([R] 24 D þ4.3 (c 1.0, MeOH)). The molecular formula      1 and2) are in accord with the basic skeleton of clerodane diterpenoids previously isolated from Casearia species. 10,18,35 The acyclic moiety at C-9, including the diene group, was deduced from the correlations of H-12 with C-11, H-14 with C-13 and C-16, H-15 with C-13 and C-14, and H-16 with C-14 (Figure 2). The position of the hydroxy group at C-7 was deduced by the long-range correlation of the oxymethine signal at δ H 3.66 (H-7) with δ C 77.5 (C-6), 44.8 (C-8), and 11.7 (C-17) (Figure 2). A decadienoate moiety, identified by gHMBC and gCOSY correlations (Figure 2), was characterized by a Z-(δ H 5.68, J = 11.5 Hz; 6.69, J = 11.5 Hz) and an E-double bond (δ H 7.37, J = 14.0, 11.5 Hz; 6.16, J = 14.0, 7.0 Hz) and a triplet methyl (δ H 0.98, J = 7.0 Hz). This same 2Z,4E-decadienoate unit has been verified in other clerodane diterpenes isolated from C. pitumba and C. arguta. 6,36 Its position was determined at C-6 (δ C 77.5), on the basis of the long-range correlation observed in the gHMBC spectrum between the oxymethine proton (H-6) and the carbonyl carbon (δ C 167.3, C-1 0 ). Finally, since H-19 (δ C 6.49) was correlated with the carbonyl group (δ C 171.4) of one acetate unit, the second acetate unit (δ C 171.8 and 21.0) must be located at C-18 (Figure 2). The relative configuration of 1 was determined by using coupling constants, 1D-NOE data, and 13 C NMR chemical shifts (Table 1 andFigure 3). The trans configuration between the C-17 and C-20 methyl groups was shown by the chemical shift at δ C 26.4 for C-20, which also supported a cis-A/B ring junction. 3,5,10 The J values of 3.5 and 13.5 Hz for the coupling of H-10 and H-1 revealed that H-10 (rel-R) is in the axial position. The NOE enhancement between H-19 and H-10, and H-19 and H-7, indicated the same R-orientation to H-19 and H-7 (Figure 2). The large coupling constant between H-6 (δ H 5.18 -1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz) and H-7 (δ H 3.66 -1H, t, J = 10.0 Hz) supported their 1,2-diaxial relationship. The NOE interaction between H-6 (rel-β) and H-8 implied that H-8 and Me-17 were at axial and equatorial positions, respectively. A small coupling constant of 4.0 Hz for H-2/H-1 suggested an equatorial orientation for H-2 (rel-β), which was confirmed by the broad triplet at δ H 4.45 and the chemical shift of C-2 at δ C 64.2. From the allylic coupling between H-3 and H-18 (J = 1.5 Hz) and NOE enhancement observed between H-18 and H-6 it can be deduced that H-18 also has a β-orientation. Therefore, casearupestrun A (1), a new clerodane diterpenoid, was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,-8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-18,19-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-6-[(2 0 Z,4 0 E)decadienoyloxy]-2,7-dihydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene.The MS, UV, and IR data and the specific rotation value of casearupestrin B (2) were comparable with those of 1. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopic data (Tables 1 and2) revealed the same substituents and substitution patterns. However, changes in the chemical shift values related to H-6 (δ H 3.75 -1H, d, J = 10.5 Hz) and H-7 (δ H 5.15 -1H, t, J = 10.5 Hz) required placement of the decadienoate ester at C-7. The structure 2 was corroborated by the same correlations observed for 1 in the gHMQC, gHMBC, and gCOSY (Figure 2). The observed NOESY interactions and coupling constants for casearupestrin B (2) indicate the same relative configuration as 1 (Figure 3 and Table 1). Hence, casearupestrin B (2) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R, 9R,10S,18R,19R)-18,19-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7-[(2 0 Z,4 0 E)decadienoyloxy]-2,6-dihydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene.The structures of the remaining two compounds can be rationalized by comparison with the previous ones. Analysis of the NMR data of compound 3 revealed a strong similarity to compounds 1 and 2. However, the molecular formula C 33 H 48 O 8 , determined by the HRESIMS, revealed a sodiated ion peak at m/ z 595.3241 [M þ Na] þ , which implied 10 degrees of unsaturation. The main difference observed in the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of compound 3 in relation to compounds 1 and 2 (Tables 1 and2) was the presence of signals at δ H 3.36 (1H, s) and δ C 55. 4. These signals indicated that an acetoxy group at C-18 was replaced by a methoxy group, which was confirmed by the gHMBC correlation between H-18 and the methoxy group. The relative configuration of 3 was identical to 1 on the basis of the same NOESY interactions (Figure 3) and coupling constants. Thus, casearupestrin C (3) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-19-acetoxy-18, 19-epoxy-7-[(2 0 Z,4 0 E)-decadienoyloxy]-2,6-dihydroxy-18-methoxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene.Compound 4 had the molecular formula C 36 H 50 O 10 , determined by HRESIMS (observed m/z 665.3297 [M þ Na] þ ). The 1 H and 13 C NMR data of 4 (casearupestrin D) (Tables 1 and2) were similar to those of 2 except for replacement of a hydroxy group at C-6 by an acetoxy group [δ H 1.95 (3H, s), δ C 171.5, δ C 20.9]. The 1 H and 13 C NMR assignments of compound 4 were confirmed by 2D NMR correlations, and its configuration was established by the sign of the specific rotation, NOESY interactions, and coupling constants (Figure 3). Thus, casearupestrin D (4) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-6,18, 19-triacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7-[(2 0 Z,4 0 E)-decadienoyloxy]-2-hydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene.Acetylation of 1 and 4 with Ac 2 O-pyridine yielded two new clerodane diterpenes derivatives, 5 and 6, respectively (Tables 1 and2, NMR data). The products were named 2,7di-O-acetylcasearupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6).The results of the biological tests of compounds 1-6 are shown in Table 3. Casearupestrins A (1), B (2), and D (4) showed significant cytotoxicity against four cell lines (HL-60, HCT-8, MDA/MB-435, and SF-295), with IC 50 values ranging from 0.10 to 1.3 μM. Compound 1 had an IC 50 value of 0.36 μM against MDA/MB-435 and SF-295 cancer cell lines, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin (Table 3). Acetylation of compounds 1 and 4 resulted in decreased cytotoxicity (Table 3), indicating that the C-2 OH group is essential for the cytotoxicity of these compounds.
