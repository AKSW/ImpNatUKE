New quinolizidine and diaza-adamantane alkaloids from Acosmium dasycarpum (Vog.) Yakovlev-Fabaceae
The phytochemical investigation of the methanol crude extract obtained from Acosmium dasycarpum (Vog.) Yakovlev root bark led to the isolation of the quinolizidine alkaloids lupanine, acosmine, acosminine and lupanacosmine, as well as the diaza-adamantane alkaloids panacosmine and dasycarpumine. Lupanacosmine (4) and dasycarpumine (6) have been described for the first time herein.

Acosmium dasycarpum (Vog.)Yakovlev, [1][2][3] occurs predominantly at the Brazilian savannahs (the 'Cerrados'), 3,4 being locally known as perobinha, chapada, pau paratudo, or unha d'anta. [4][5][6] The tea prepared from the root bark of this species has been described in the first edition of the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia as a sedative. In folk medicine, the stem and root tea preparation have been used to treat inflammation, skin diseases, and disturbances from central nervous and cardio-vascular systems. [7][8][9][10] Quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs) are secondary compounds found in seeds of many species of plants, possibly protecting them against pathogens and seed predators. Structural, spectroscopic and computational studies on both natural and synthetic quinolizidines are also reported regularly and have shown to be an important class of alkaloid with biological significance. 11 Studies on the biological activity of compounds containing azabicyclic building blocks (e.g., rigid bicyclic peptidomimetics) are gaining momentum because this class is attractive as nematicidal and has shown to be especially active at the muscarinic receptor, enhancing insulin secretion and also presenting diuretic properties. 12 On the other hand, diaza-adamantane skeleton was firstly encountered in a natural product, isolated from the seeds of Acosmium panamense. 1 This class of compounds is uncommon, but due to the high pharmacological activities it has recently drawn great attention in folk medicine research. 13 Aiming the isolation and identification of bioactive substances, we have isolated several alkaloids during the conventional chromatographic fractioning of the methanol crude extract from the root bark of A. dasycarpum. The alkaloids lupanine 1, acosmine 2, acosminine 3, and panacosmine 5 have been previously reported in Acosmium. 1,14 However, the alkaloids lupanacosmine 4 and dasycarpumine 6 have been described for the first time herein. Acosmium dasycarpum aerial roots were collected at Chapada dos Guimarães, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil and identified by Dr. M. Macedo (Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso-UFMT). Voucher specimens numbered 24079 (01/02/2000) were deposited at UFMT Central Herbarium. The dried root barks (3.3 kg) were sequentially extracted with hexane (3 L) and methanol (5 L). A portion (55.0 g) of the crude methanol extract (EBMeOH) dissolved in methanol (200 mL) was acidified with 10% acetic acid (pH 2.5-3.0), extracted with CHCl 3 (3 Â 50 mL) and alkalinized with NH 4 OH (pH 8.9-9.0), affording the alkaloids fraction FA-I (5.5 g; 9.98%). FA-I was submitted to column chromatography, affording compound 6 (11.5 mg; 0.02%). Compound 1 (3.3 mg; 0.006%) was obtained after HPLC purification. 15 Another EBMeOH portion (150.0 g) was acidified with 5% HCl (pH 2.5-3.0), extracted with ethyl ether (4 Â 50 mL) and alkalinized with 28% NH 4 OH (pH 8.5-9.0), affording the alkaloids fraction FA-II (3.8 g; 2.53%). Preparative thin-layer chromatography carried out on FA-II led to the isolation of 2 (15.3 mg; 0.01%), 1 3 (21.2 mg; 0.14%), 1 4 (56.4 mg; 0.04%), 16 and 5 (8.1 mg; 0.01%). 1,17 Compound 1 has shown, in its IR spectrum, typical amide absorption at 1620 cm À1 . This absorption is coherent with the 13 C NMR signal at d 172.0. These and the other spectral data obtained for compound 1 were fully consistent with the literature description for the quinolizidine alkaloid lupanine. 12,14,18 Mass spectra for compound 2 has shown an odd molecular ion [M + ] at 357, pointing out to the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in its structure. The DEPT experiment has presented a methinic signal at d 70.9. Therefore in comparison with compound 1, compound 2 must have a substituent at C-10. The absence of an amide carbonyl group at C-2, as well as the evidences for the presence of the substituent at C-10, could be demonstrated from the HMBC data, correlating H-10 (d 2.36) to C-2 (d 52.9) C-8 (d 27.9), C-9 (d 37.  2). The same has been observed in 1 H NMR spectra, at positions H-23 and H-25, as previously observed in the literature. 1,14 The stereochemistry of the substituent at C-10 in compound 2 has been demonstrated to be equatorial, as it could be seen by the coupling of H-8 ax with H-10 ax in the COSY experiment (Table 2). These data are fully supportive of structure 2, previously reported by the literature. 14 However, literature 13 1).The c-gauche effect observed by analyzing C-11 and C-15 13 C NMR signals of compound 3, when compared to the equivalent signals in 2 (Table 1), has shown that the hydroxyl group is in an axial position. These data were consistent with the literature structure for the alkaloid acosminine. 14 Typically, quinolizidine alkaloids H NMR spectra. 1 The respective olefinic carbons could be observed in 13 C NMR spectra at d 136.1 and d 116.3, relating to trisubstituted (@CH-) and bi-substituted (@CH 2 ) carbons, respec-tively, according to the DEPT spectra. The analysis of the HMBC spectra analysis has shown that the methyl hydrogen H-  3) has also been observed. COSY spectrum has shown H-6 and H-2 x coupling with each other, as well as the coupling of H-2 x with H-2 y and H-6, suggesting a chair conformation to ring A in compound 4 (Fig. 2). The non-observation of H-10 coupling to H-8 indicates that the acetylamide group is in an equatorial position. This equatorial stereochemistry was further confirmed by the correlation of H-9 with axial H-10 and H-9 with H-8 x and H-8 y , with small J values, justifying the observed H-9 large singlet. The diaza-adamantane alkaloid 5, namely panacosmine, has been previously described in the literature 1 and the spectral data ( 13 C and 1 H NMR, IR and high resolution MS) are fully consistent with the ones we have obtained. 17 The newly described compound 6 spectral data 19 were compared with the related    3), C-11 (d 60.8), C-18 (d 117.4), C-19 (d 24.7), and C-23 (d 123.0) (Fig. 1A; Table 2). In the same experiment, the correlation of H-23 (d 6.67/7.27) to C-10 (d 70.9), C-19 (d 24.7) and C-21 (d 40.4) (Fig. 1B; Table 2) and the correlation of H-25 (d 2.20/2.15) to C-23 (d 123.0/122.0) and C-24 (d 168.0) (Table 2) has also been observed. The coupling of H-23 (d 6.67/ 2.15) to C-23 (d 123.0/122.0) has been shown by the COSY and HSQC experiments. HMBC experiments has shown that the methylic H-25 (d 2.20/7.27) correlates to C-24 (d 168.0) and C-23 (d 123.0/122.0), confirming the presence of an acetylamide portion at the substituent (Fig. 1B). Restricted rotation around C-N bond at the acetylamide moiety has caused the doubling of 13 C NMR signals at C-23 and C-25 (Table

Our attribution can be considered more reliable, however, since it was based in 2-D experiments, not available at the time of the previous literature report. The spectral data for compound 3 were similar to those observed for 2, except for ring D. Mass spectrum for compound 3 has shown a molecular ion at m/z 373, sixteen units higher than compound 2, suggesting the presence of a hydroxyl group. Further evidence for the presence of this group was observed by the IR absorption at 3393 cm À1 , by DEPT experiment showing a carbinolic signal at d 68.6 and by the shifting of C-12 and C-1413  C NMR signal from d 34.3 to d 42.9 and from d 25.7 to d 34.2, respectively (TableHomo ( 1 H-1 H) and heteronuclear ( 1 H-13 C) correlations of 4Hd HCOSY/HSQCHMBCCH 2H 2x = 1.59H 2y , H 6n.o54.6H 2y = 3.32H 2xJ 3 C 4 , J 3 C 6H 31.53n.o.n.o.26.2H 41.79H 5axJ 2 C 5 , J 3 C 2 , J 3 C 625.6H 5H 5ax = 1.37H 4J 3 C 330.3H 5equiv = 1.60 H 6n.o.H 62.04H 2J 5 C 15 , J 3 C 1767.0H 71.83H 17 , H 8x , H 8yn.o.33.6H 8H 8x = 1.33H 8y , H 7J 3 C 6 , J 3 C 10 , J 3 C 11 , J 3 C 17 27.8H 8y = 1.97H 8x, H 9, H 7J 3 C 6 , J 3 C 10H 91.66H 8x, H 8y , H 10 , H 11 n.o.34.3H 102.57H 9J 2 C 18 , J 3 C 23 , J 3 C 1170.7H 112.59H 12 , H 9n.o.59.3H 122.16H 11 , H 12 , H 13J 3 C 9 , J 2 C 11 , J 2 C 13 , J 3 C 14 31.7/30.7H 135.56H 14 , H 12n.o.136.1H 14a,b 5.02H 14x,y , H 13J 3 C 12116.3H 152.24n.o.J 3 C 11 , J 3 C 1742.4/42.3H 17a,b 2.65H 17x,yn.o.50.9C 18n.a.n.a.n.a.118.0H 191.85n.o.n.o.25.4H 201.79H 20n.o.21.5H 21H 21x = 3.55H 21y , H 20n.o.40.4H 21y = 3.59H 21xn.o.H 236.89/7.24n.o.J 3 C 10 , J 3 C 21 , J 4 C 19123.4/121.8C@On.a.n.a.n.a.168.2/167.5H 252.18H 11J2  C 24 , J 4 C 23 22.0/23.0x and y: Stereochemistry not defined.; n.a.: not apply; n.o.: not observed. observed
NMR spectra show poorly resolved signals at the region d 3.75-1.25.
