CATHARINENSINE, AN OXINDOLE ALKALOID FROM PESCHIERA CATHARINENSIS
The structure of catharmensme Isolated from Peschtera cathartnensts was deduced from a detailed analysis of Its 'H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectra The synthesis of 17-demethoxyrhynchophylhne confirmed its structure, and led us to suggest the configuration al10 A for catharmensme Coronandme, lsovoacangme, heyneanme, 16-ep&inme, decarbomethoxyvoacamme and conodurme were also isolated

INTRODUCTIONThe presence of toxic plants m pastures IS responsible for 5% of the cattle deaths m the State of Paran& Brazil Govannont et al [l] ldentdied 54 toxic species and confirmed the presence of toxic prmclples m 12 Of these, Peschwa catharwmsts (DC) Mlers (Apocynaceae, subtribe Tabemamontanmae) was the only alkaloldcontaining species not previously studied, Peschrera represents an exclusively Amencan genus and has not been fully investigated [2] 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFrom the methanohc extract of the bark, we isolated a new alkaloid, catharmensme (l), together with coronarme (2), lsovoacangme (3), heyneanme (4), 16-eplaffimne (S), decarbomethoxyvoacam me (6) and conodurme (7) Catharmensme (I), C21H26Nz03, a hght yellow, 011~ compound had [a]g -194", and a UV absorption spectrum analogous to that of lsorhynchophylhne (8) [3,4] suggesting that these two compounds possessed smnlar chromophores The 'H NMR assignments were based on comparison with lsorhynchophylhne (8), rhynchophylhne (9), corynoxme (10) and lsocorynoxme (11) [3,4] The low-field doublet at 6 7 56 (lH, J = 7 Hz) was mdlcative of a C-9 H and N-4 lone-pair mteractlon [3,4] -17, respectively, in 8 [6,7] by the olefimc quatemary and methylene carbon resonances at 142 7 (C-16) and 125 2 (C-17) ppm, respectively All these properties are consistent with structure 1 for catharmensme As this structure represents a novel oxmdole alkaloid, the synthesis of 16 was undertaken to provide final confirmation and rhynchophyllme (9) was taken as a startmg matenal (Scheme 1) Only one of the two possible C-16 epmers of 12 was obtained m 45% yield, by treatment of 9 with HgSO,-H$O,[S] followed by NaBH,--EtOH reduction Treatment of 12 with MsCl-pyndme m CHzCll produced two mesylates, 13 and 14, m a ratio of 2 3 Because of the known C-7 lsomemtlon of oxmdole alkaloids m the presence of pyndme [3,4] and the presence of a low-field doublet at S, 7 80 together with four singlets at 6,3 80 (-COOMe), 3 60 (-COOMe), 3 00 (-S02Me), 2 84 (-S02Me), it was concluded that the mesylates were C-7 eplmers Ehmmatlon of the mesyl group with DBN-CHQ at room temperature? afforded 17-demethoxyrhynchophylhne (15) and 17-demethoxyisorhynchophylhne ( 16) with the configuration normal B and normal A, respectively (takmg into consideration that rhynchophylhne (9), normal B [9], was our starting matenal and that the reactions should not alter the asymmetnc centres, except for C-7) The mass spectra of 15,16 and 1 had fragment ions with equal m/z values but Qfferent relative abundances Thus fact and the nearly superunposable 'H NMR spectra of IS,16 and 1 led us to the conclusion that these compounds were dlastereolsomers Thus the synthesis of 15 and 16 confirmed the proposed structure for 1 but not its configurationUsing the general procedure for configurational analy-SIS of rhynchophylhne-type alkaloids [S], we subrmtted a S&l sample of 1 to isomenzation in pyrldme After 48 hr, A soln of 12 (0 066 g, 18 mmol) m CHzClz (0 51 ml) and pyndme (0 21 ml) was added dropwlse to a stirred soln of methanesulfonyl chlonde (0 05 ml) and CHzClz (0 51 ml) at 0 After 1 hr the mutture was poured mto ice-HzO, stnred for an additional 3 hr and then extracted wrath CHCl, (3 x 50 ml) The combined organic extracts were dned and evapd (00448) NH.,OH was added to the aq phase until pH9 and extracted once more The CHC13 extracts were dned (NazSO,) and evapd, yleldmg an additional 0 066 g The crude realdue (0 11 g) conslsted of two mesylates, 13 and 14, 'H NMR 6 2 84 (s, -SOzMe), 3 00 (s, -SOzMe), 3 60 (s, -COOMe), 3 80 (s, COOMe), 7 80 (br d)To a soln of 13 and 14 (001 g), m CHzClz (loml), was added dlazotucyclo-[4 3 O]-non-5-ene (0 5 ml), the rmxture stlrred at room temp overnight, the CHzCIz evapd and the residue applied to a slhca gel column and eluted with CHC& to yield 00009goflS This and conslderatlon of the most probable conformations of the aght possible dmstereolsomers of the rhynchophyllmold type [4] suggested that 1 possessed ather the configuration normal A, allo A, pseudo B or eplallo B The presence of two smglets at 6 5 46 and 6 46 and the lack of a peak attributable to a vinyl methyl ether group mdlcated a C-16 to C-17 terminal double bond The mass spectrum of 1 displayed ions typical of a tetracychc oxmdole of the rhynchophylhne type [S] (354 *To whom correspondence should he addressed t3-Mesyl-ethylbutanoate was taken as a model compound for the mesyl group ehnnnation reaction Among several bases (OEt-, py. DBU, DABCO and DBN), the best results were obtamed using DBN [Ml+, 209 (rmg D), 194 (rmg D -Me), 180 (rmg D -Et), 178 (rmg D -OMe)) but these peaks were shifted to lower mass by 30 mu, thus mdlcatmg a mod&Won m rmg D of 1 compared with that of 8 Smnlarly, the differences m the 13C NMR spectra of 1 and 8 were m the b-values of the rmg D carbons and m the replacement of the olefimc quatemary and methme carbon resonances at 113 0 and 150 5 ppm assigned to C-16 and C
