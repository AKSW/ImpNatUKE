nor-Lignans from the leaves of Styrax ferrugineus (Styracaceae) with antibacterial and antifungal activity $
Chemical examination of the leaves ofmethylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran and the lignan, dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol. All arylpropanoids isolated showed antibacterial and antifungal activities. The structures of the isolates were established by spectroscopic analysis.

IntroductionStyracaceae is a family constituted of small trees and shrubs, mostly native to tropical and subtropical regions (Pio Correa, 1931). The genus Styrax is dierent from other genera of this family due to the production of resinous material, usually secreted when the barks and trunks are injured by sharp objects (Pio Correa, 1931). This resin, in the past considered a miraculous remedy in several parts of Asia and America, has been used in traditional medicine to treat in¯ammatory diseases (Costa, 1968). Chemical studies on several Styracaceae plant species have revealed them to be a rich source of arylpropanoids and triterpenoids (Giesbrecht et al., 1985;Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988;Anil, 1980;Segal et al., 1967Segal et al., , 1964;;Ulubelen et al., 1978;Kawai and Sugimota, 1940;Kitagawa et al., 1974;Ulubelen, 1976;Nakano et al., 1967).From the leaves of Styrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart., an endemic species of the Cerrado region, a new 5-[3 HH -(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(3 H ,4 Hdimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (4) and the known nor-lignans 5-(3 HH -hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1), 5-(3 HH -hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3 H ,4 H -dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2), 5-[3 HH -(b-d-glucopyranosyloxy)propyl]-7-methoxy-2-(3 H ,4 Hmethylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (3) and the lignan dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (5), together with ursolic and oleanolic acids, sitosterol and stigmasterol, have been isolated. Compounds 1±2 showed inhibitory properties against the microorganisms, Candida albicans, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Staphylococcus aureus, whereas compounds 3±5 inhibited only S. aureus and C. albicans. The structures of these arylpropanoids were elucidated by various NMR experiments including COSY, DEPT, HMQC, and HMBC (see Section 3 and Tables 1 and2).
Results and discussionThe dried and powdered leaves of Styrax ferrugineus were extracted with a mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 ÐCH 3 OH (2:1 v/v). Evaporation gave an extract, which showed 0031-9422/00/$ -see front matter # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. P I I : S 0123456789 3).The bioactive extract was suspended in H 2 O and then partitioned with n-hexane, CHCl 3 and EtOAc (4Â300 ml each). Silica gel chromatography of the CHCl 3 solubles (2.27 g) followed by puri®cation on preparative HPLC aorded the new compound homoegonol glucoside (4) and the known nor-lignans (1) (Takanashi et al., 1974), (2) (Giesbrecht et al., 1985) and ( 3) (Takanashi and Takizawa, 1988), and the lignan (5) (Miyase et al., 1989). The compounds were identi®ed by chromatographic and spectral comparison with those of authentic samples. In addition were also isolated ursolic and oleanolic acids (Mahato and Kundu, 1994) as a mixture, sitosterol and stigmasterol (Kojima et al., 1990). The triterpenes and sterols were identi®ed by comparison with authentic samples and spectroscopic data. A literature search revealed the absence of 13 C NMR spectral data for 5-(3 HH -hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1) and 5-(3 HH -hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3 H ,4 H -dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2). Therefore, complete assignment of the 13 C NMR spectra for these compounds was undertaken and achieved with the aid of DQF-COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. The 13 C NMR spectral data for 1 and 2 are given in Table 2 and some important HMBC correlations are presented in Fig. 1.Compound 2 was obtained earlier from the seeds of S. ocinalis (Segal et al., 1967) after acid hydrolysis and subsequent puri®cation of a glucosidic fraction from bark trunk wood of S. camporum (Giesbrecht et al., 1985). In this paper we describe the structural elucidation of compound (4) as well as the antimicrobial activities of all lignoids isolated.Compound 4 was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The molecular formula C 26 H 32 O 10 was deduced from ES-MS m/z [M+Na] + 527, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopic data. Its IR spectrum recorded hydroxyl (3550±3200 cm 1 ), unsaturated (1650 cm 1 ) and aromatic (1550, 870 cm 1 ) absorptions, and its UV absorbance    1 and2) were assigned by interpretation of the COSY, DEPT 135, HMQC and HMBC spectra. Comparison of the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of 4 with those described for 2 indicated that 4 is a glucoside derivative of compound 2. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 4 displayed four doublets at 6.77 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), 7.11 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), 7.05 (1H, d, J=8.0 Hz) and 7.41 (1H, d, J=1.9 Hz), and a double doublet at 7.44 (1H, dd, J=1.9; 8.0 Hz) attributable to aromatic protons. In addition were observed a singlet at 7.17 (1H, s) corresponding to H-3, three singlets due to methoxyl groups at 3.99, 3.88 and 3.83 (3H each, s), two triplets due to methylene protons at 2.75 (2H, t, J=7.5 Hz) and 3.66 (2H, t, J=7.8 Hz) and a double triplet due to a methylene group at 1.86 (2H, dt, J=7.8 Hz). This 1 H NMR spectroscopic pattern accommodated the same characteristics as that of compound 2. Further analysis of the 1 H NMR spectroscopic data showed a two-proton spin-system consisting of a doublet The 1 H±± 1 H COSY relationship permitted assignment of aromatic proton chemical shifts and also supported the substitution pattern. 1 H± 13 C-one bond (HMQC) data were used to assign carbon resonances (Table 2) to their attached protons. 1 H± 13 C-three-bond (HMBC) correlations from the H-1 HH protons resonances at 2.69 to the aromatic carbons resonance at 107.64 and 112.12 identi®ed the later as C-4. The 3 J HMBC couplings of the C-2, C-3 H and C-4 H quaternary carbons with H-2 H and H-6 H proton signals further supported the 1,3,4-trisubstituted pattern for the aromatic moiety linked to the benzofuran moiety of compound 4. Other signi®cant correlations for con®rmation of 4 are depicted in Fig. 1.The extract and compounds isolated from S. ferrugineus were evaluated for antifungal and antibacterial activities. The crude extract showed antifungal and antibacterial activities against C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans and S. aureus, respectively. Compounds 1±2 exhibited antifungal and antibacterial activities against C. sphaerospermum, C. albicans and S. aureus, whereas compounds 3±5 inhibited only S. aureus and C. albicans. The MIC values for these strains, together with those typically used for comparison, are shown in Table 3. The activity against the pathogenic fungus C. sphaerospermum could be predictive for the activity against C. albicans. In conclusion, the activities of compounds 1±5 may (partly) explain known properties of this plant species, which is popularly used to treat wound infections in several Brazilian regions.
Experimental
Instrumentation and chromatography materialsOptical activities were measured on a Polamat A (Carl Zeiss) polarimeter, whereas IR spectra were recorded on Perkin±Elmer 1710 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 or DMSO-d 6 on a Bruker AC 200 at 200 MHz for 1 H and 50 MHz for 13 C or Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument at 400 MHz for 1 H and 100 MHz for 13 C, using TMS as internal standard. The DEPT experiments were performed using polarization transfer pulses of 90 and 135 , respectively. The ES-MS spectra were obtained at 70 eV on a VG Platform II and EIMS spectra on a VG 70 E-HF instrument. For column chromatography, silica gel 60, 70±230 and 230±400 mesh, were used as needed. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F 254 plates, with spots visualized by anisaldehyde 2% in H 2 SO 4 after heating.
Plant materialStyrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart. Leaves were collected at Campininha Farm, Mogi-GuacË uÂ , SP, Brazil, by  M.C.M. Young in November 1995. A voucher specimen has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Garden of SaÄ o Paulo, Brazil.
BioassayThe crude extract and puri®ed lignoids were assayed for antimicrobial activity against the bacterium S. aureus ATCC 12228, the fungus C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and the yeast C. albicans ICB 12. Stock solutions of crude extracts were dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in the solvent of extraction. Pure compounds were freshly prepared at 1 mg/ml in an appropriate solvent and were diluted to 100, 50, 30, 10, 5, 1.0 mg/ml. 10 ml of these solutions were applied on precoated TLC plates by means of graduated capillaries. Antibiotic samples mycostatin and chloramphenicol, 30 mg/ml) and the solvent used were also tested as positive and negative controls, respectively. For the antifungal bioautography assay, TLC plates were developed in an appropriate solvent system and thoroughly dried for complete removal of solvents (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The chromatograms were sprayed with the spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum in a nutritive medium and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 27 C. Clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background. Agar dilution assays with C. albicans and S. aureus were carried out Sabouraud agar medium (Rahalison et al., 1991). The media were plated in Petri dishes and cell suspensions of C. albicans and S. aureus in distilled water were spread over agar. Incubation was at 30 C for 24 h.
ExtractionDried and pulverized leaves (3.5 kg) of Styrax ferrugineus Ness et Mart. were exhaustively extracted with a mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 ±CH 3 OH (2:1, v/v) at room temperature. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, a crude extract (23 g) was obtained. The concentrate was then diluted with CH 3 OH±H 2 O (8:2) and successively extracted with hexane, CHCl 3 and EtOAc. After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 2.01, 2.27 and 1.57 g, respectively. The CHCl 3 extract (2.27 g) was fractionated by column chromatography on a silica gel ¯ash (77.9 g, 230±400 mesh, Merck) using a CH 2 Cl 2 ±CH 3 OH gradient to yield 93 fractions. Fr. 26 (29 mg) yielded pure 5-(3 HH -hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3 H ,4 H -methylenedioxyphenyl)benzofuran (1), and Fr. 34 (137 mg) yielded 5-(3 HH -hydroxypropyl) -7 -methoxy -2 -(3 H ,4 H -dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2). Fr. 40±41 (39.4 mg) was fractionated by micron silica gel ¯ash CC (Merck) using CH 2 Cl 2 ±CH 3 OH (95:5) as eluent to aord 11 Frs. Frs. 5±9 gave a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids (21 mg). Frs. 52±55 (50 mg) were submitted to medium pressure silica ¯ash CC (11.6 g, 230±400 mesh, Merck) using Hex±EtoAc±CH 3 OH (6:2:2) as eluent to aord 20 Frs. Frs 6±12 furnished dihydrodehydiconiferyl alcohol (5) (14 mg). Fr. 65 (43.6 mg) after silica gel 60 G (15.0 g, Merck) CC, using a CH 2 Cl 2 ±CH 3 OH gradient yielded 22 Frs. Fr. 20 (13.8 mg) gave a mixture of 3+4, which was further puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-18 column) using a mixture of CH 3 OH± H 2 O (4:6) as eluent to aord compounds 3 (4.0 mg) and 4 (5.8 mg).

A solution containing glucoside 4 (2.0 mg) in 3 M HCl (5 ml) was heated until re¯ux began, this being maintained for 4 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, neutralized with 1% NaOH and extracted with CHCl 3 (3Â10 ml). The reaction mixture was puri®ed on CC silica gel using CH 2 Cl 2 ±CH 3 OH (99:1) as eluent to obtain 2 (1.0 mg) which showed the same R f [0.5 CH 2 Cl 2 ±CH 3 OH (98:2)], IR and 1 H of authentic 5-(3 HH -hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2-(3 H ,4 H -dimethoxyphenyl)benzofuran (2). Identi®cation of the glucose obtained as a product of the reaction was con®rmed after reaction of the aqueous fraction with an enzymatic kit based on glucose oxidase, this being speci®c for glucose and yielding a positive response (Trinder, 1969).

at 4.11 (1H, d, J=8.0 Hz) and several signals at 4.33±3.45 m, indicative of a glucosyl moiety in compound 4. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 4 (Table 2) suggested the presence of a nor-lignan with similar skeleton to 2. The main dierence observed in the 13 C NMR spectrum of 4 was due to the presence of the signals at 103.01 (CH), 76.82 (CH), 76.86 (CH), 73.54 (CH), 70.10 (CH) and 61.08 (CH 2 ) which con®rmed a glucosyl moiety.
