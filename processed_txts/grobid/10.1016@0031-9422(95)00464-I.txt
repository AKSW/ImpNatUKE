LIGNANS FROM KERNELS OF VIROLA MICHELII HECKEL
A new tetrahydrofuran lignan, the (+)-(7S,8R,8'R)-3',4'-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxy-7,9'-epoxylignan-9-ol, was isolated from kernels of germinated seeds of Virola michelii, besides 10 previously described lignans: (+)-sesamin, (+)-fargesin, (+)-phillygenin, (-)-hinokinin, (-)-kusunokinin, (-)-dimethylmatairesinol, (+)-lariciresinol dimethyl ether, ( -)-dihydrocubebin, ( -)-2,3-desmethoxy-seco-isolintetralin and ( -)-3',4',-dimethoxy-3',4'desmethylenedioxycubebin.

INTRODUCTIONThe genus Virola (Myristicaceae) includes 59 species distributed in one South American rain forest (Venezuela, Guianas and Brazil). Virola michelii Heckel is widely spread in the Brazilian Amazon, and it is popularly called 'ucu6ba' [1,2]. Phytochemical analysis carded out on a morphologically related species V. venosa revealed the accumulation of flavones in flowers and pericarps at an early phase of fruit development [3]. During maturation such flavones are substituted by lignans, which also accumulate in arils and seeds. Apparently, no detectable changes occur in the lignan content during germination [31. In one case of V. surinamensis, a butenolide polyketide and neolignans have also been isolated as major components in leaves from seedlings and adult plants [4]. The aim of this work addressed phytochemical investigations on germinated seeds taken from seedlings collected beneath the parent tree of V. michelii. Besides 10 previously reported iignans, one new tetrahydrofuran lignan (la) is described.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Chromatographic fractionationof the dichloromethane extracts from kernels of the germinated seeds of V. michelii afforded lignans belonging to five different structural types: (+)-sesamin [5-71, (+)-fargesin [8][9][10], ( +)-phillygenin [7, 111 (furofuran lignans), (-)-hinokinin [121, (-)-kusunokinin [121, (-)dimethylmatairesinol [12] (dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans), ( + )-(7S,8R,8'R)-3',4'-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxy-7,9'-epoxylignan-9-ol, (+)-lariciresinol dimethyl fAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed. ether [13,14] (tetrahydrofuran lignans), (-)-dihydrocubebin [15, 161, (-)-2,3-desmethoxy-seco-isolintetralin [16] (dibenzylbutanediol lignans) and (-)-3',4'dimethoxy-3',4'-desmethylenedioxycubebin [17] (dibenzylbutyrolactol lignan). The structural elucidation of these lignans was attained by spectroscopic techniques and by direct comparison with authentic samples.The new tetrahydrofuran lignan la possesses the molecular formula CzIH2406 as determined from low resolution mass spectroscopy (M + 372) and from 1H and 3C counting in NMR spectra. Its IR spectrum exhibited a broad band at 3430 cm-~ assignable to a hydroxyl group. The ~HNMR spectrum showed one methylenedioxyphenyl group at 65.95, two methoxyi groups at 63.87 and six aromatic protons (66.71-6.85), indicating two trisubstituted benzene rings. Additionally, its H NMR spectrum revealed for the aliphatic protons the same profile as observed for lignans lb and le [18], with a doublet at 64.79 (6.5 Hz, H-7), two nonequivalent oxymethylene protons (dd, 6.4 and 8.4 Hz, H-9'a or H-9'b) at 64.05 and a multiplet at 63.72-3.96 (2 H-9, H-9'a or H-9'b); one doublet-doublet at 32.93 (4.6 and 12.8 Hz, H-7'a or H-7'b) and a multiplet at t52.35-2.80 (H-8, H-8', and H-7'a or H-7'b). Its mass spectrum gave a base peak at m/z 151 (100%), assignable to 3,4-dimethoxytropylium ion and ArCH = +OH (Ar = 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl) besides another at m/z 149 (methylenedioxybenzoyl ion). Both ions arise from a typical cleavage of the tetrahydrofuran lignan. The definition of the substituents in each aromatic ring as depicted for the structure la was also supported by the ~3C NMR data obtained for la-lc and dihydrocubebin (Table 1). The chemical shifts for aliphatic and aromatic carbons of la were assigned by comparison with those of lariciresinol dimethyl ether (lb) [14], dihydrosesamin (le) [18] and dihydrocubebin [15,16]. The assignments of chemical shifts for tetrahydrofuran carbons were assigned by direct comparison to that of lariciresinol [14] or using dihydrocubebin as a model compound (Table 1). An important effect observed on chemical shifts of aromatic carbons is due to a fl-effect caused by the oxygen of the tetrahydrofuran ring on C-1 of compounds la (137.0) and lc (137.2) as compared to dihydrocubebin (134.3), and a y-effect on carbons C-2/C-6 of la (106.3/119.1) and le (106.2/119.0) as compared to dihydrocubebin (108.1/121.9).The accumulation of furofuran, tetrahydrofuran, dibenzylbutanediol and dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans in seeds has been previously demonstrated in V. venosa [3]. Nevertheless, remarkable differences were observed in V. elongata in which these lignans accumulate only in its pericarps, arils and seed coat, while in kernels the presence of aryltetralins and aryltetralone neolignans are ubiquitous [19].The absolute configurations for all isolated lignans were established as 8R/8'R from optical rotation signals and/or circular dichroism curves. Indeed, the biosynthetic sequence (+)-furofuran, (+)-tetrahydrofuran, (-)-butanediol and (-)-butyrolactone, involving the series 8R/8'R, has recently been proved to occur enzymically in Forsythia intermedia plants 1 -20] and might be the case in Virola species, considering solely their absolute configurations.  Extraction and isolation of the constituents. The dried kernels (24.98 g) of the seedling of V. michelii were ground and exhaustively extracted with CH2CI 2 at room temp. The CH2CI 2 extracts were concd in vacuo to give a brown mass (15.63 g, 62.6%). A portion of this extract (10 g), submitted to CC using solvents of increasing gradient of polarity (n-hexane, EtOAc and EtOH), gave different groups of frs (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14). Frs 1-5 (2395 mg) contained a mixt. of non-polar materials that was not further investigated. Frs 6 and 7 (135 mg) were submitted to prep. TLC (CH2CI2-Me2CO, 0.25%) to give ( +)-sesamin (5.2 rag), (+)-fargesin (8.3 rag) and (-)-hinokinin (37.2 rag). Frs 8-12 (1321 mg) were subjected to CC on silica gel and eluted with CH2C12-Me2CO , MeOH to give frs A-N. Frs B-D yielded (-)-kusunokinin (688.6 rag) and frs E-G afforded ( -)-dimethylmatairesinol (175.1 rag). Frs H and I were pooled and recrystallized with MeOH to give (+)-phillygenin (11.2 mg). Fr K was purified by prep. TLC (CH2C12-Me2CO, 5%) and yielded la (4.7 mg) and ( -)-3',4'-dimethoxy-3',4'-demethylenedioxycubebin (11.5mg). Fr. L was purified by prep. HPLC (Lichrosorb RP-8 column; 250 x 22 ram; flow rate 12mlmin-1; detection at 254nm) with HzO-MeOH [3: 17 ~ 3 : 22 (30 min)] to give ( -)-dihydrocubebin (2.0 rag). Frs 13 and 14 (562 mg) were subjected to CC on alumina in vacuo using solvents of increasing polarity (CH2C12, Me2CO and MeOH) affording 8 frs (a-h). Ft. b and frs d and f afforded (-)-dimethylmatairesinol (27.6mg) and (+)-lariciresinol dimethyl ether (lb, 21.8 mg), respectively. Frs g and h were purified by HPLC (Perkin-Elmer C-18 column; 250 x 4.5 ram; flow rate 2 ml rain-1; detection at 254 nm) with H20-MeOH   1.(+)-Lariciresinol dimethyl ether (lb).
