STRUCTURAL CONFIRMATION OF DIHYDROCINNAMIC ACIDS FROM ADISCANTHUS FUSCIFLORUS BY "C NMR"
In the wood of A&scat&us ~uusci~oru.s six known alkaloids ~-methoxy-2-quinolone, I-methyl-4methoxy-2-quinolone, dictamine, skimmianine, y-fagarine and N-methylflindersinc and two new dihydrocinnamic acids 3-[2',6'-dimethoxy-6",6"-dimethylpyrano(2",3":4',3')phenyl]-propi~~nic acid and its methyl ester were identified. The structures of the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives were confirmed by "C NMR.Adiscanthus fusciflorus Ducke. an arboreous Rutaceae species from the Amazon region, contains in a section of its trunk (bark included) 4-methoxy-2-quinolone,

I-methyl-4-methoxy-2-quinolone, dictamine and skimmianine [3], y-fagarine[4] and N-methylfiindersine. All these alkaloids have been separated previously from other rutaceous species, the first four inclusively from another Amazonian species,
Hortia longifoliaSpr. ex Engl. [3], and the last one by N-methylation of natural flindersine [.5]. Their identification was based on spectra and direct comparison with authentic samples.Two additional constituents, isolated from the same extract of A. fusciporus, were the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives la and lb, which, jointly with dihydrocinnamyl alcohols such as lc 161, had been previously found in Hortia badinii M.A. Lisboa. The structural elucidation of these natural products had been based chiefly on the interpretation of 'H NMR spectra. Their re-isolation was therefore an opportunity to test the proposed formulae by '"CNMR.    1.

substituted C-S' must indeed be vicinal to only one methoxyl (6 S5..3j, lSCNMR showing the other one (8 62.0j to be flanked by two ortho substituents. The signals due to the corresponding ipso-carbons (C-6' 6 158.5. C-2' 8 154.9) can be easily assigned due to their complex secondary splitting in the fully protoncoupled C spectrum. In this same spectrum, signals of the ipso-carbons C--2" and C-3" show a contrastingly simpler splitting pattern which can be eliminated by decoupling respectively at the resonance frequencies of H-4" (double irradiation at S 6.48) and H-S" (double irradiation at ii 5.45). These decoupling experiments were additionally very useful in the coniirmation of the respective assignment of signals to C-4" and C,5" since the first order C-H couplings are eliminated. Finally. double irradiation at the frequency of the gem-dimethyl protons (6 1.38) collapsed the fine splitting of the C-5" signal, confirming the vicinality of this carbon and CMe,. At this stage, since correlation of signals to carbons of the propionic acid moiety is trivial, only the signals at 6 113.7 and 75.5 remained to be assigned, a task performed by comparison with model compounds 2 [7] and 3 [ri]. respectively. OMe The spectrum of la served as the basis in the interpretation of the spectra of lb, dihydro-lb and le. The suppression of the 4",5''-double bond of lb in dihydro-lb caused a paramagnetic shift of the C-2" signal (a8 4.4), an expression of the endocyclic homoallylic effect [Yl. Most significantly. from the

This is due to the absence in this compound of MeO-6' which thus fails to shield C-3 through a y-effect. deactivated with 10% H,O, C$H,-CHCI,, 9: 1). The column was extruded and divided into 8 equal parts which gave from bottom to top 8 fractions. Fraction 4 was purified by TLC (Si gel, C,H,-EtOAc, 7 : 3) giving la (30 mg). Fractions 5 and 6 were washed with hexane to give lb (200 mg). Fraction 7 contained 1-methyl-4-methoxy-2-quinolone. The hexane insol. part of the extract was suspended in CHCl, and filtered.

Fraction C was separated by TLC (Si gel, C,H,-EtOAc, 7:3) into dictamine (20 mg) and y-fagarine (60 mg). Fraction D was purified similarly to give N-methylflindersine (50 mg).
