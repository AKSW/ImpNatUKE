IntroductionSpiranthera odoratissma St. Hil., is a shrub found in the central Brazilian savannah, as well as in Bolivia. 1 In Mato Grosso state it is known by the vernacular name of "manacá", being used in folk medicine to treat syphilis, rheumatism, kidney infections, urinary retention, abdominal pains, gout, acne and boil. 2 This plant has already been investigated from chemistry viewpoint. From a specimen collected in Bahia were isolated furoquinoline alkaloids; coumarins and terpenes. 3 The Rutaceae family is characterized by the abundance of anthranilic acid derived alkaloids coumarins, limonoids and flavonoids mainly. 4 We have been interested in the chemistry of Rutaceae, [5][6][7][8] and as part of ongoing work on this family, in this study we describe the isolation and the identification of two new limonoids, as well as the known limonin. Also described are the isolation and identification of the furoquinoline alkaloids γ-fagarine dictamnine, skimmianine, the β-indoloquinazoline alkaloids rutaecarpine, evodiamine and 1-hydroxyrutaecarpine, the coumarin aurapten and β-sitosterol.
Experimental
General experimental proceduresMelting points were measured in a Mettler FP-80 apparatus and are uncorrected. Specific rotations were determined in a Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter. The IR spectra were obtained in a Bomem FT-IR MB100 equipment with the samples in KBr pellets. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were measured in Bruker AC-200 (200 MHz), ARX-400 (400 MHz) and Varian Mercury-300 (300 MHz) apparatus. The chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in ppm and the coupling constants (J) in Hertz; TMS was used as internal standard, as well as the residual hydrogen from the solvents (CDCl 3 and DMSO-d 6 ). Radial preparative chromatography (RPC) was carried out with a Chromatotron apparatus and were performed with Merck Kiesegel 60 PF254. Column chromatography (CC) was performed with silica gel 60 (Merck, 63-230 μm), and flash column chromatography with silica (Merck, 43-63 μm). Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out with Merck Kiesegel 60 F254 (0.25 mm) plates.
Plant materialThe roots from S. odoratissima were collected at Cuiabá-Barão de Melgaço road (Km 1) in December 1999. A voucher specimen was deposited at Central Herbarium of Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso (registration # 24246).
Extraction and isolation of compoundsThe roots of S. odoratissima (3.3 kg) were macerated at room temperature with dichloromethane (3 x 8L), with occasional stirring, during 7 days. The dichloromethane extract-DCE (126 g; 3.82%) was obtained after filtration and solvent removal in vacuo. Subsequent extraction was performed with methanol (3 x 8L) using the same procedure above, affording the methanol extract-ME (120 g; 3.64%).An aliquot of DCE (20.0 g) was submitted to conventional acid-base extraction (HCl 1%; 4 x 100 mL) and the alkaloid fraction (190 mg) was chromatographed by RPC, in a 4 mm radial plate, with hexane-CHCl 3 (8:2; 100 mL); CHCl 3 (250 mL) and CHCl 3 -MeOH (95:5; 100 mL), affording 6 fractions. The furoquinoline alkaloids γ-fagarine (15 mg), dictamnine (8 mg) and skimmianine (30 mg) were isolated after washing fractions 2, 3 and 4 with Et 2 O.Another DCE fraction (42.5 g) was filtered in a silica column (400 g) with petrol ether (0.5 L), CH 2 Cl 2 (2 L), CHCl 3 (1 L), CHCl 3 -MeOH (99:1; 2 L), CHCl 3 -MeOH (9:1; 1 L), MeOH (1 L) and MeOH-0.1%HOAc (0.5 L), affording fractions A to G, respectively.Column chromatography (CC) was carried out on fraction B (23.0 g) employing the gradient solvent system: hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 (1:1; 450 mL), CH 2 Cl 2 (200 mL), CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH (99:1; 200 mL), (95:5; 200 mL), (9:1; 600 mL) and MeOH (200 mL), affording 8 fractions after TLC analysis.

Single crystal X-ray analysisLow temperature X-ray diffraction data collections were performed at 120(2) K, on an Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystem liquid N 2 device, using graphite-monochromated MoK α radiation (0.71073 Å). Data were collected up to 50° in 2θ, with a redundancy of 4 in the phi scans and omega scans with kappa offsets modes. The final unit cell parameters were based on all reflections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program; 9 integration and scaling of the reflections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack system of programs. 10 No absorption corrections were applied.The structures were solved by direct methods with SHELXS 86 11 and SHELXS-97. 12 The models were refined by full-matrix least squares on F 2 with SHELXL-97. 13 All the hydrogen atoms were stereochemically positioned and refined with the riding model. 12 Hydrogen atoms of the CH and CH 2 groups were set isotropic with a thermal parameter 20% greater than the equivalent isotropic displacement parameter of the atom to which each one was bonded. This percentage was set to 50% for the hydrogen atoms of the CH 3 groups. Data collections and experimental details for the complexes are summarized in Table 3. The programs SHELXL-97, 13 and ORTEP-3 14 were used within WinGX 15 to prepare materials for publication. Atomic coordinates, bond lengths and angles, and thermal parameters have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (see below).
Results and DiscussionLimonoid (1) has been isolated from the dichloromethane extract from the roots of S. odoratissima as a white amorphous solid (mp 174-177 o C), presenting [α] D 25 (CHCl 3 ): -26º. The IR spectrum has shown absorptions at 3405 (OH), 1767 (lactone), 1741 (α,βunsaturated ester) and 1714 (ketone). 1 H NMR spectrum presented signals related to the β-substituted furan ring, where H-21 and H-23 appeared as multiplets at δ 7.41 and at δ 7.36, respectively. The β-furan hydrogen H-22 appeared as a double doublet at δ 6.37 (J= 1.7, 0.8 Hz). The hydrogen H-17, from the δ-epoxylactone ring, was observed at δ 5.54 (s, 1H).The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra from (1) has shown similarities with the correlated spectra of (3), also isolated in this study, as shown in Tables 1 and2. The absence of two doublets, associated to the geminal hydrogens at C-19, very common in structures related to (3), displaying a A,D-seco ring, 16 when linked with the low intensity, quaternary carbon signal observed at δ 182.5, from the DEPT experiment, was a good indication for the presence of a carbonyl group at C-19 in 1. HMBC spectrum has shown long distance coupling (J 3 ) between H-1, H-9 and C-19, confirming that C-19 in 1 is oxidized.The α,β-unsaturated ester moiety, detected by the IR spectrum, was further confirmed by 1 H NMR (δ 3.71, s, 3H; -CO 2 CH 3 ), as well as by the signals at δ 165.5 (-CO 2 CH 3 ) and δ 52.3 (-CO 2 CH 3 ) in 13 C NMR. The olefinic hydrogens H-1 and H-2 were detected as two doublets at δ 6.65 and δ 6.12 respectively; the cis configuration of the double bond could be determined by the coupling constant value (J 1,2 = 12.4 Hz). HSQC spectrum showed correlation between these two protons and the carbons at δ 151.6 (C-1) and δ 123.2 (C-2), respectively. The DEPT 13 C NMR spectrum presented two signals related to methylenic carbons at δ 38.1 (C-6) and δ 41.2 (C-12). HMBC experiment has shown H-6 correlation with C-7 (δ 207.3; J 2 ) and C-4 (δ 87.6; J 3 ). The methylenic hydrogen H-6 resonated at δ 3.24 (dd, J= 18.4, 10.4 Hz, H-6 ax ) and δ 2.74 (dd, J= 18.4, 2.5 Hz, H-6 eq ); COSY spectrum has shown coupling of both hydrogen with H-5 at δ 3.09 (dd, J= 10.4, 2.5 Hz).Reasonably similar values have been observed when comparing the 13 C NMR data for rings B and D in compounds ( 1) and (3) (Table 2). DEPT experiment, however, presented three signals related to methylenic carbons in (3) and only two signals related to methylenic carbons in (1). The hydroxyl group, shown to be present in (1) by the IR spectrum, nevertheless, should be located at C-11 or C-12 in ring C. Furthermore, the carbinolic hydrogen appeared as a broad doublet at δ 4.51 (J= 6.7 Hz, 1H), which has been associated to δ 66.4 signal (HSQC), indicating that H-11 couples only with one H-12 eq . No coupling was observed between H-11 and H-9 and H-12 ax . The HMBC spectrum showed a long distance coupling (J 3 ) with C-8 (δ 48.5), confirming that the hydroxylated carbon is C-11. The α stereochemistry of the OH group was determined by X-ray crystallography (Figure 2). The H-12 methylenic hydrogens were observed at δ 1.83 (d, J= 15 Hz, H-12 ax ) and δ 1.61 (m, H-12 eq ). HMBC showed long range coupling (J 3 ) between H-12 ax      Figure 1 .1Figure 1. Limonoids isolated from the roots of S. odoratissima.
