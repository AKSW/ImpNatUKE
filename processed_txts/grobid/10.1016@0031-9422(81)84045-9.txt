LIGNANS AND NEOLIGNANS FROM LICARIA ARMENIACA*
A re-examination of the trunk wood of Licaria armeniaca led to the isolation of 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin, 1,2,3-trimethoxy-7-oxoaporphine (tri-O-methylmoschatoline), 2e-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-6e-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo [3.3.0]octan (magnolin) and a novel neolignan (7S

INTRODUCTIONA previous study of the trunk wood of the Amazonian Lauraceae species Licaria armeniaca (Nees) Kosterm. revealed the presence of 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin and of two porosin-type neolignans [2]. The species is rather widespread and seemingly prone to chemical variation. Indeed, the study of another specimen indicated 6,7dimethoxycoumarin and the oxoaporphine tri-Omethylmoschatoline [3] to be accompanied by the furofuran lignan magnolin [4] and a novel neolignan. For reasons stated in a previous paper of this series [5], nomenclature and numbering of neolignans follow the rules outlined in a recent review [6 ].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe neolignan, C23H2sO ~ by C and H NMR counts associated with a mass spectrometric molecular weight determination, was assigned structure la upon l comparison with lb [6 ] and 2 [7 ] by IR, H NMR (Table 1), 13C NMR (Table 2) and ORD (Table 3) data. Indeed the H-9 (6 0.92 _+ 0.02) and H-6' (6 5.65 + 0.05) signals of la and lb are similar and differ significantly from the H-9 (6 1.23) and H-6' (6 6.10) signals of 2. As expected, the t3C NMR signals for C-9 (6 13.9) and C-6' (6 124.1) of la (endo-Me-8) occur at a higher field than the signals for C-9 (6 17.4) and C-6' (6 126.8) of 2 (exo-Me-8), in view of the reciprocal y-effects felt by these carbons in the former compound.The significant spectral differences between la and lh are due to the existence of piperonyl and acetoxyl in lavs 3-methoxypiperonyl and hydroxyl in lb. This was confirmed respectively by MS, which cleaves la into the typical [CH20 2 . * Part LXII in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae". For Part LXI see ref. [1 ].

The epimeric alcohol 3 is a by-product in this reaction. The IaC NMR spectra of the   2) were assigned by the comparison of totally decoupled spectra with single frequency offresonance decoupled spectra and theoretical considerations [9][10][11]. Hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl to the MeO-3' oxygen impels the MeO-methyl to such a position as to exert y-effects on C-2' of le (+5 78.2 vs 84.5 for C-2' in 3) and on C-7 of 3 (6 55.6 vs 57.0 for C-7 of lc). As the natural compound la is recovered upon acetylation of le, the configuration of its aeetoxy is confirmed. An independent confirmation of the spatial vicinity vs distance of hydroxyl and aryl was achieved by measurement of the CsDsN-induced solvent shifts for the Acetylation of le (Ac20, CsHsN, room temp., 24 hr), followed by the usual work-up gave a product shown to be identical with la by TLC (Si gel) and tH NMR spectroscopy.C6H 3 .
