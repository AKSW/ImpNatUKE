Validated HPLC method for the standardization of Phyllanthus niruri (herb and commercial extracts) using corilagin as a phytochemical marker
Phyllanthus niruri L., commonly known in Brazil as 'quebra-pedra' , has long been used in the treatment of diverse diseases and especially urolithiasis. The therapeutic effects of P. niruri are attributed to various compounds present in the plant, including the hydrolysable tannin corilagin. In the present study, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-/PAD) profiles of leaves and commercial extracts of P. niruri were examined and three compounds, found to be present in all of the samples studied, were isolated by open column chromatography over C 18 silica gel followed by preparative HPLC. These compounds were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance as corilagin, rutin and ethyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate. Corilagin, which has been proposed as a phytochemical marker for P. niruri, was employed as an external standard in the development and validation of a rapid and efficient qualitative and quantitative HPLC assay for the analyte. The method may be applied in the standardization of herbs and phytomedicines commercialized in Brazil as quebra-pedra.

IntroductionMedicinal plants have been employed since antiquity in the treatment of a wide range of diseases and conditions, and have played a key role in the provision of health care worldwide. In spite of the spectacular advances in the discovery of novel drugs that have occurred over the last few decades, plants still continue to make important contributions both in providing lead molecules for further pharmaceutical research and as alternative sources of efficacious medication (Cragg et al., 1997;Shu, 1998).Phytomedicines are composed of plant organs supplied either in natura (generally leaves, roots or bark) or in processed form (typically liquid or powdered extracts). Commercial extracts normally contain the active principles of the plant material in crude or processed state, together with excipients, i.e. solvents, diluents or preservatives (Calixto, 2000). Irrespective of the formulation of the phytomedicine, however, quality control and standardization of product is critical to the efficacy of the therapy. In this respect, the source and quality of the raw materials play a pivotal role in guaranteeing the quality and stability of the herbal preparations (Calixto, 2000). Moreover, it is very important to monitor and standardize the active principles responsible for the pharmacological action of the drug through direct quantification. In cases where the active principles are unknown, appropriate phytochemical marker compounds need to be established for analytical purposes (Anvisa, 2004).The annual herb Phyllanthus niruri (family Euphorbiaceae) has a worldwide distribution and is particularly popular in Brazilian folk medicine under the common name of 'quebra pedra' ('stone breaker' , by virtue of its strong action on kidney stones and gallstones; Micali et al., 2006). The plant is used in the treatment of a wide range of human diseases and especially in the treatment of urolithiasis (Barros et al., 2006;Paulino et al., 1996). Clinical studies have demonstrated that P. niruri exhibits no acute or chronic toxicity, and preliminary data indicate that the drug promotes the normalization of calcium levels in hypercalciuric patients (Nishiura et al., 2004).The therapeutic effects of P. niruri have been attributed to various classes of constituents including lignans (Singh et al., 1989;Satyanarayana et al., 1988), alkaloids (Tempesta et al., 1998;Joshi et al., 1986;Mulchandani and Hassarajani, 1984), flavonoids (Than et al., 2006), terpenoids (Ueno et al., 1988), phenylpropanoids (Singh et al., 1986) and the hydrolysable tannin, corilagin (Duan et al., 2005;Kolodziej et al., 2005;Hatano et al., 2005). Several chromatographic studies have demonstrated the presence of corilagin in the leaves and extracts of various species of the genus Phyllanthus (Kumaran and Karunakaran, 2006;Markom et al., 2007) and pharmacological evidence indicates a correlation between the presence of corilagin and therapeutic activity (Duan et al., 2005;Shen et al., 2003).The aim of the present study was to develop high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC)-ultra violet-photodiode array detection (PAD) methods for the rapid isolation and quantitative determination of corilagin (Fig. 1) in leaves of P. niruri and in commercial phytomedicines derived therefrom. Using the developed methods, two further components that are characteristic of the herbal drug were purified and identified as ethyl 3,4,5trihydroxybenzoate and rutin (Fig. 1) by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. It is proposed that the described method for the analysis of the phytochemical marker, corilagin, could be applied in the quality control and standardization of herbs and extracts commercialized in Brazil as authentic 'quebra-pedra' .
Experimental Plant Material and Commercial ExtractsLeaf material (air-dried at ca 40°C and stored at room temperature for 6 months) of Phyllanthus niruri L. and of three industrial extracts (dry powder, code 20916; water soluble dry powder, code 20131; and fluid extract, code 20517) derived from the macerated leaves of the plant were provided by Anidro do Brasil Extrações Ltda., Botucatu, SP, Brazil. The plant material was identified and authenticated by Raquel Popolo Silveira at the Instituto Botânico de São Paulo, SP, Brazil, and the identity confirmed from the results of histological tests carried out in the quality control section of the supplying company.
Chemicals and StandardsHPLC-grade acetonitrile and methanol were supplied by J. T. Baker (Philipsburg, PA, USA), whilst analytical grade acetic acid was from Synth (Diadema, SP, Brazil). Water was purified using a Milli-Q apparatus (Millipore, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Caffeine (99% pure; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and corilagin (97% pure; isolated in the Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Araraquara, SP, Brazil) were employed as standards.
Isolation of components from P. niruriA sample (2.5 g) of the commercial fluid extract derived from P. niruri was dried in a rotary evaporator and the residue dissolved in 15 mL of methanol:water (15:85 v/v). The methanolic extract was submitted to fractionation using classical liquid chromatograph technical and one column (11.0 × 2.5 cm i.d.) packed with C 18 silica gel (2 g) and eluted with a step gradient comprising 200 mL each of methanol:water mixtures (15:85, 25:75; 40:60; 65:35 v/v) and finally with methanol (200 mL). Fractions 2 and 3, which eluted with 25 and 40% aqueous methanol, respectively, were further purified by preparative HPLC using a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) LC-10-AVP chromatograph equipped with a model SPD-10A VP UV detector, a model FRC-10ASIL-10AF fraction collector and an LC workstation for data collection and processing. Separation was carried out on a Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA) Luna® C 18 column (250 × 21.2 mm i.d.; 10 μm particle size; 100 Å pore size) eluted isocratically with 0.1% acetic acid in water:acetonitrile (80:20 v/v) at a flow rate of 17 mL min -1 . The detector was set to record at 254 nm. The major components of fraction 2 eluted from the HPLC at 8.5 min (2) and 15.0 min (3), whilst that of fraction 3 eluted at 6.5 min (1).
Structural Characterization of the Major Components 1-3 Isolated from P. niruriThe eluates associated with each of the three major HPLC peaks of fractions 2 and 3 were collected, concentrated by rotary evaporation, dried to constant weight in a vacuum desiccator under nitrogen, and dissolved in deuterated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSOd 6 ) for NMR analysis. The NMR experiments were carried out using a Varian (Harbor City, CA, USA) model 11.7 T INOVA-500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz ( 1 H) and 126 MHz ( 13 C). The 1 H-and 13 CNMR spectra were assigned using data obtained from gHMQC and gHMBC experiments, whilst multiplicities were determined with the aid of 500 MHz gCOSY spectra: in all cases DMSO-d 6 was employed as the internal standard.
Preparation of Samples for Analytical HPLC AnalysisCommercial dry powder extracts (ca 0.01 g) were weighed accurately and sonicated with 10 mL of methanol:water (40:60 v/v) for 30 min at room temperature. A 1 mL aliquot of the resulting solution was submitted to solid-phase extraction (SPE) over Bakerbond (J. T. Baker) SPE cartridges (3 mL), each containing 500 mg of C 18 silica gel (40 μm particle size), that had been pre-conditioned with 1 mL of methanol and 1 mL of water. Cartridges were eluted with 2 mL of methanol:water (40:60 v/v). The interfering compounds were retained by the C 18 silica gel, whilst the eluate (2 mL) was filtered through a 0.22 μm Millex membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and an aliquot (20 μL) assayed by HPLC.Commercial fluid extracts (1 mL) were diluted to 10 mL with methanol:water (40:60 v/v), and a 1 mL aliquot of this solution submitted to the SPE procedure as described above. In the case of dried leaf material, a sample (1.0 g) was sonicated with 20 mL of methanol:water (40:60 v/v) for 30 min at room temperature, and a 1 mL aliquot of this solution was submitted to the SPE procedure as described above. The eluate (2 mL) was filtered through a 0.22 μm Millex membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and an aliquot (20 μL) assayed by HPLC.
Chromatographic ConditionsIn preliminary studies, the HPLC profiles of leaves and of various commercial extracts of P. niruri were obtained using a Phenomenex Luna C 18 column (250 × 4.6 mm i.d.; 5 μm particle size; 100 Å pore size) protected by a C 18 guard column (4.0 × 3.0 mm i.d.; 5 μm particle size; 100 Å pore size). The mobile phase comprised 1% aqueous acetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), and linear gradient elution from 5 to 100% B in 40 min at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min -1 was employed.During further investigations, the chromatographic parameters (column, mobile phase, flow rate and elution program) were optimized in order to provide better separation of components in a shorter run time. Validation of the optimized method were performed using a Waters (Milford, MA, USA) Alliance® model 2795 liquid chromatographic system equipped with a model 996 PAD and a Phenomenex Luna phenyl-hexyl column (250 × 4.6 mm i.d.; 5 μm particle size; 100 Å pore size) protected by a phenyl-hexyl guard column (4.0 × 3.0 mm i.d.; 5 μm particle size; 100 Å pore size). The mobile phase comprised a mixture of solvents A and B, as above, and was delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min -1 , the sample injection volume was 20 μL, and the column was held at room temperature during the analysis. The final gradient employed in the developed analytical method was: 0-12 min, 13-37% B; 12-13 min, 37-100% B; 13-15 min, 100% B; 15-16 min, 100 to 13% B; and 16-30 min, isocratic at 13% B. The chromatogram was monitored at 267 nm, and UV spectra of individual peaks were recorded in the range 200-400 nm. Data were processed using Waters Empower Pro® version 5.0.
Validation of the MethodThe validation of the analytical method was performed according to the requirements of the Brazilian Government proposed by National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance (Anvisa, 2003) and suggestions proposed by Ribani et al. (2004).Selectivity and Specificity. Analyte purity across the peak eluting from the HPLC at a retention time corresponding to that of corilagin was confirmed using the data derived from the PAD in association with the software resource provided by the workstation.Analytical curve. An external standard method was utilized to construct the analytical curve for corilagin measured at a wavelength of 267 nm. A stock solution of standard was prepared by weighing 15.7 mg of corilagin (purity 97%) and dissolving in 25 mL of methanol:water (40:60 v/v) to give a final concentration of 609.16 mg L -1 . Four additional standard solutions, with concentrations of 304.58, 121.83, 60.92 and 24.37 mg L -1 , were prepared by appropriate dilution of the stock solution. Each of the five standard solutions was injected into the HPLC in triplicate, and the regression equation and linearity factor determined.
Repeatability and intermediate precision.Repeatability was estimated by assaying solutions containing three different concentrations of the water-soluble dry powder extract in methanol:water (40:60 v/v), each analysis being carried out in triplicate by the same operator on the same day. Intermediate precision was determined by analysing, in triplicate, one of the solutions employed in the repeatability test on two consecutive days and by another operator.Reproducibility. Reproducibility was examined in another laboratory by carrying out analyses on a Shimadzu LC-10-AVP instrument equipped with a model SIL-10AF auto sampler and a SPD-10A VP UV-vis detector together with a similar Phenomenex phenyl-hexyl analytical column system to that described above. A second stock solution of standard was prepared by weighing 13.2 mg of corilagin (purity 97%) and dissolving in 25 mL of methanol:water (40:60 v/v) to give a final concentration of 512.16 mg L -1 . Four additional standard solutions, with concentrations of 256.08, 102.43, 51.22 and 20.49 mg L -1 were prepared by appropriate dilution of the stock solution. A separate analytical curve was constructed by analyzing the five corilagin standard solutions as described above. The same solution employed in the repeatability test was reanalysed in triplicate in the second laboratory in order to determine the reproducibility. Precision was expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation (CV), the maximum acceptable value of which was set at 5% (Anvisa, 2003).Accuracy and recovery. Accuracy and recovery were determined by application of the developed method to a certified reference material ('surrogate'; Ribani et al., 2004). Caffeine was employed as the 'surrogate' since it exhibited solubility properties and the λ max that were similar to those of corilagin, but the alkaloid did not co-elute with any of the peaks present in the extracts. An analytical curve was constructed at 267 nm by analysing a stock solution of caffeine with a concentration 522.72 mg L -1 [obtained by dissolving 13.2 mg of caffeine (purity 99%) in 25 mL of methanol:water (40:60 v/v)], and four diluted standard solutions containing 261.36, 104.54, 52.27 and 10.45 mg L -1 caffeine. Samples of the water-soluble dry powder extract were spiked with three different concentrations of caffeine and submitted to sonication and SPE procedure as described in the Experimental section. Aliquots (20 μL) were quantified by HPLC using the described method. Accuracy was evaluated by back-calculation and expressed as the percentage deviation between the amount of caffeine found and the amount added at the three concentrations examined.Limit of detection and limit of quantification. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated on the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3, whilst the limit of quantification (LOQ) was determined at an S/N of 10. The noise level was measured during the analysis of a sample and involved a portion of the chromatogram that was separate from the region containing the corilagin peak.
Robustness.Analyses were carried out with different flow rates of the mobile phase (0.9 and 1.1 mL min -1 ), with different pH values of the mobile phase (3.33 and 3.25), with different elution gradients (i.e. starting the gradient at 12 or 14% of solvent B), and with different batches of the phenyl-hexyl column (lot numbers 5296-24 and 5296-26), in order to estimate the robustness of the method.
Results and Discussion
HPLC Profile of P. niruri Leaf ExtractThe initial HPLC profiles of commercial and leaf extracts of P. niruri were similar and showed several minor peaks and some more abundant peaks (Fig. 2). On the basis of these analyses, the commercial fluid extract was submitted to the described isolation process and, following preparative HPLC separation, three compounds that were present in all of the extracts were obtained (Fig. 2).
Common Components of Leaves of P. niruriThe structures of the three common compounds, isolated in the form of dark brown amorphous powders, were identified by NMR analysis and confirmed by comparison with spectral data available in the literature (Nawwar et al., 1994;Conegero et al., 2003;Exarchou et al., 2006;Wenkert and Gottlieg, 1977;Parmar et al., 1997). The structures of the components identified are presented in Fig. 1 and their spectral details are shown below.Corilagin (1). 1 HNMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): δ H 7.01 (2H, s, H-2″ and H-6″), 6.55 (1H, s, H-2′), 6.48 (1H, s, H-2), 6.20 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-1′′′), 4.58 (1H, br s, H-3′′′), 4.35 (1H, t, J = 8.5 Hz, H-5′′′), 4.22 (1H, br s, H-4′′′), 4.21 (1H, dd, J = 11.0, 8.5 Hz, H-6′′′), 3.97 (1H, dd, J = 11.0, 8.5 Hz, H-6′′′), 3.87 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-2′′′);13 CNMR (126 MHz, DMSO-d 6 ): hexahydroxydiphenoyl δ C 167.1 and 166.8 (C=O), 145.6 (C-5′), 144.9 (C-5), 144.3 (C-3′), 143.9 (C-3), 135.6 (C-4′), 135.5 (C-4), 123.9 (C-1′), 123.1 (C-1), 115.8 (C-6′), 
Development and Validation of the HPLC MethodFollowing the isolation and purification of corilagin from Phyllanthus extracts, the compound was used as an external standard for the development and validation of a chromatographic method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the analyte in commercial extracts. The purity of the corilagin was determined by normalization of the peak areas detected by HPLC-PAD (Wang et al., 2005;Bebrevska et al., 2007;Li et al., 2007) and from impurity signals detected in the NMR spectra. Optimization of the chromatographic conditions of the original HPLC method allowed a more rapid and efficient separation of corilagin from other components of the extracts, as shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity and specificity of the analytical method was confirmed from the purity angle and the purity threshold of corilagin obtained using the PAD workstation software resource for the standard analyte and for each of the extracts assayed (Anvisa, 2003).Within the region of the UV spectrum between 200 and 400 nm, corilagin displayed a λ max around 267 nm. From the analytical curve constructed with corilagin as external standard, the response of the UV detector at 267 nm was found to be linear in the range 609.16-24.37 mg L -1 of analyte, and the regression equation was y = 9630x -47,300 with a correlation coefficient (r 2 ) of 0.9999 and a CV of <2% for triplicate analyses.In the analysis of the accuracy and recovery of the method, the analytical curve for caffeine was linear between 522.72 and 10.45 mg L -1 of analyte with a regression equation of y = 50,100x + 40,700 and an r 2 of 0.9998. The recoveries of caffeine from spiked extract solutions were 97.52, 97.89 and 97.28% in respect of each of the three concentrations analysed. In terms of repeatability, the CVs obtained for the three different concentrations  The reproducibility of the method was examined in two different laboratories. In the second laboratory in which a analytical curve was constructed with corilagin as external standard, the response of the UV detector at 267 nm was found to be linear in the range 512.16-20.49 mg L -1 of analyte, and the regression equation was y = 13,281x -108,131, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9999 and a CV of <2% for triplicate analyses. The CV of the results between laboratories was 0.06%.The LOD and LOQ values were 0.987 and 3.29 mg L -1 , respectively. The test of robustness showed that the method was insensitive to small variations in the flow rate, pH and the initial composition of the mobile phase. No significant variations (relative standard deviation 1.07%) were found between analyses conducted using different batches of chromatographic columns.
ConclusionsSeveral studies have indicated that corilagin is one of the key compounds responsible for the pharmacological activity of P. niruri (Duan et al., 2005;Shen et al., 2003). In the present study, a simple and efficient method has been developed for the isolation of pure corilagin, a compound that is not currently commercially available as a standard analyte. Additionally, a rapid and fully validated HPLC method using corilagin as a potential phytochemical marker has been elaborated for the analysis of industrial extracts, commercial phytomedicines and herbs sold as authentic 'quebra-pedra' in Brazil. Using the isolation method described, two further compounds that are characteristic of P. niruri were also isolated and their structures were elucidated by NMR. It is possible that these components might also be to be applied as phytochemical markers.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.
