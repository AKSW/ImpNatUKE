The seed of Virola sebifera contains besides the polyketide 1 -(2',6' -dihydroxyphenyl)-11phenylundecan -1 -one, four neolignans: (2S, 3S, 4R) -4 -hydroxy -2,3 -dimethyl -5,6 -methylenedioxy -4piperonyl -1 -tetralone and its 2-epimer, as well as (2R, 3R, 4s) -4 -hydroxy -6,7 -dimethoxy -2,3 -dimethyl -4 -piperonyl -1 -tetralone and its (2R, 3S, 4R) -dehydroxy analogue.

INTRODUCTIONVirola sebifera is widely distributed over South America. The species has been reported (under the synonym V. uenezuelensis Warb.) to yield a fat that is valued for treatment of rheumatism in Venezuela [2]. Although in Brazil this "ucuhuba" fat is expressed for industrial purposes, and the bark of the tree serves in the preparation of hallucinogenic snuffs by Amazonian Indians [2], such uses are seemingly restricted to northern regions and V. sebifera remains without conspicuous use in SBo Paulo State.The compositions of the triacylglycerols [3,4] and of the psychotomimetic drug [2,.5] are fairly well known. Since the biological activity of the crude fat can hardly be due to the lipids the chemical analysis of the seed seemed in order. Indeed, the present work shows this to be a rich source of novel compounds, the polyketide la, the oxo-otobains 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, as well as further metabolites to be described in a subsequent report. 17OOcm-'. The mass spectra were compatible with the structures, showing the base peaks at m/z 137 (dihydroxybenzoyl ions) and peaks of moderate relative intensity at m/t 91 (tropylium ions). In the spectra of lb and lc peaks at m/z 179 (acetoxyhydroxybenzoyl ion) and 221 (diacetoxybenzoyl ion) were also present.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
CompoundThe structure of the diarylundecanoid la from V. sebifera belongs to a type previously detected in the fruits of Myristica malabarica Lam. [6]. The most significant difference between la and the malabaricones (Id, le, If, lg) refers to the biosynthesis which seemingly involves the condensation of cinnamic acid with myristic acid in the former case and with lauric acid in the latter case.Compounds 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b were recognized as 4-aryltetralin neolignans by joint consideration of the formulae, respectively GJ-I,~OH K&CH&O, C18H130H(02CH2)20, C,sH,~OH(OMe)2 O&Hz0 and C,8H,4(OMe)Z 02CHz0, the 'H NMR spectra of which all contained a pair of methyl doublets (J = 7 Hz), and the mass spectra, which all contained prominent [M -MeCH=CHMe]" peaks. The uncharacterized oxygen atom of the formulae must belong to a carbonyl which in all four compounds is part of a benzoyl unit (YInax KBr 1674 * 9 cm-'), and thus can occupy only position 1 of the tetralins. The vicinal aromatic position 8 must be unsubstituted, as indicated by 'H NMR signals at relatively low field: 6 7.65 + 0.05 (d, J = 8 Hz) for 2a and 2b; S 7.51 kO.05 (s) for 3a and 3b (Table 1). While these data define the constitution of the bis-methylenedioxytetralins of series 2, doubts remain concerning the relative position of the vicinal methoxyls and the methylenedioxy units in the compound of series 3.Conclusive proof of the carbon skeleton was obtained for 3a. Acid dehydration of this compound leads to the 4-aryl-1-naphthol, similar in respect to UV, IR and 'H NMR characteristics to tetradehydroisogalactin (4b). Conspicuous spectral differences L. M. X. LOPES et al.  The difference between compounds 2a and 2b is of a stereochemical nature as shown by 'H NMR measurements.Indeed, the coupling constant of the H-2, H-3 interaction is much larger for 2a (12 Hz) than for 2b (3 Hz) and a tram diaxial relation characterizes this system in the former compound. Both methyl substituents of 2a must hence be equatorial, a conformation which can be equally assigned to the piperonyl group in view of its differential shielding effect on the methylene protons (6 5.66 and 5.78, doublets, J = 2 Hz) of the CHz02 substituent on positions 5 and 6. Acid or alkaline treatment of 2a, a reaction which would be expected to epimerize C-2, generates 2b. In this compound, the steric strain resulting from the 1,3-cis interaction of the methyl at C-2 and the hydroxyl at C-4 should cause a change of conformation whereby the carbonyl and the piperonyl  groups move somewhat from their location in the equatorial plane. Indeed, the carbonyl of 2b (v,,,,~ 1683 cm-') shows less conjugation with the aromatic ring than the carbonyl of 2a (v,,, 1670cm-'); and although the differential action on the methylene protons of the CH202 group at positions 5 and 6 remains, no shielding effect is perceptible (6 6.03 and 6.00, doublets, .I = 2 Hz).

Again JH_2.H_3 (12Hz for 3a and 3b) is rather large, as is JH_3,H_, (8 Hz) in 3b; and again the equatorial piperonyl group causes shielding effects, on H-5 and on Me-3 (S 6.29, 0.88 respectively for 3a and 6.26, 0.97 respectively for 3b).While 4-aryltetralone neolignans have not been reported previously, 4-aryltetralin neolignans are well known [7]. According to Crabbe and Klyne [8] the sign of the Cotton effect of the benzenoid chromophore between 275 and 290nm is indicative of the configuration of the 4-aryl substituent, a positive effect pointing to an n-aryl group and vice versa. Based on this rule, Klyne et al. [9] assigned the (2S, 3R, 4s) and (2S, 3R, 4R) stereochemistries to hydroxyotobain (5a) and otobain (5b), constituents of Dialyanthera otoba (Myristicaceae).Defunctionalization of 2a at C-l, by sequential LiAlH4 reduction to 2c and hydrogenolysis, gave hydroxyotobain (2e) identical, with respect to the ORD curve, to the compound from D. otoba. The CD curve, however, shows that the Cotton effect in the 280-290 nm region is negative (Table 2) and that hence, according to CrabbC and Klyne's rule [8], the /3-aryl (4R) configuration must be assigned to hydroxyotobain 2e, not 5a). The wrong stereochemical assignments for hydroxyotobain and for otabain in the published report [9] is due to the fact that the authors deduced the sign of the Cotton effect considering the spectral region above instead of below 280 nm.Transformation of 2a into 2e excluding alterations in chirality implies that 2a must possess the (2S, 3S, 4R)-configuration.Its positive Cotton effect at the absorption of the carbonyl chromophore (333 nm) contrasts with the negative effects at the same wavelength of 2b, 3a and 3b which thus must possess respectively the (2R, 3S, 4R), (2R, 3R, 4s) and (2R, 3S, 4R) configurations. la, CZ3H3003, was recognized as a diarylundecanone by the 'H NMR signals for two symmetrical aromatic rings, a phenyl group and a 26-dihydroxybenzoyl group, as well as for ten methylene units, two of which placed (Y to carbonyl or aryl moieties. Acetylation of la led to the monoacetate lb which, as the parent compound, showed an AlCl, UV shift and a 1620cm-' IR band, both indicative of an ortho-hydroxycarbonyl substituted aromatic ring. In contradistinction, no AlCl, UV shift was observed for the diacetate (lc) and, as expected, the IR carbonyl band appeared at *Part XVI in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Myristicaceae", For Part XV see ref. [l]. Taken from part of the M.S. thesis presented by L.M.X.L. to the Universidade de SLo Paulo (1980).

EXPERIMENTALIsolation of constituents. Ripening fruits of V. sebiferaAubl. were collected by Hipolito F. Paulino Filho, UNESP, Araraquara, from a specimen, identified by Dr. William A. Rodrigues, INPA, Manaus, near SLo SebastiPo do Paraiso, Minas Gerais State. The seeds had their epicarp removed, were air dried (72hr) and ground to a mass (225g) which was exhaustively extracted with C6H6 at room temp. The solvent was evapd and the residue (60 g) partitioned between petrol and MeOH-H,O (9: 1). The former soln was evapd yielding fats. The latter soln was evapd and the residue dissolved in EtOAc. The soln was washed with H20, 10% aq. NaHCOJ and 2% aq. HCI. The EtOAc soln was evapd and the residue (22 g) submitted to dry CC (4OOg Si gel, CHCI,-EtOAc, 97:3). The column was cut into 33 portions. Portions l-9 were crystallized from MeOH to yield fats (3.5 g). The mother liquor was evapd and the residue separated by prep. TLC (AlzOp, CHCI,) into la Table2.
