The title acid, C 16 H 20 O 5 , was extracted from Adiscanthus fusci¯orus (Rutaceae) and is shown to inhibit adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) enzyme activity. This compound crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. There is one strong hydrogen bond, with O D Á Á ÁO A = 2.6238 (12) A Ê and O D ÐHÁ Á ÁO A = 171.1 (17) involving the COOH group, forming a cyclic dimer about a center of symmetry. The packing of the molecules is additionally stabilized by one CÐ HÁ Á ÁO [C D Á Á ÁO A = 2.9820 (16) A Ê and C D ÐHÁ Á ÁO A = 101.8 (10) ] and two CÐHÁ Á Á% intermolecular hydrogen bonds.
CommentThe title carboxylic acid, (I), has been investigated because of its interesting inhibitory activity against adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) from Leishmania tarentolae which is a member of the phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) family. The PRTases are responsible for the salvage of purine, pyridine and pyrimidine nucleotides, as well as aromatic amino acids. Most organisms synthesize adenine nucleotides by both the de novo and the salvage pathways. In contrast, protozoan parasites are strict purine nucleotide auxotrophs because of the absence of a purine de novo biosynthetic pathway (Berens et al., 1995). Therefore, these microorganisms are absolutely dependent on scavenging pre-formed purine nucleotides from the host or the media (Ullman & Carter, 1997). To look for new potential anti-leishmania drugs, we used the APRT from L. tarentolae as a model system to investigate the inhibitory capacity of A. fusci¯orus extracts. The screening was performed using a spectrophotometric assay (Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1980); the IC 50 of pure compound (I) is 147 mM. In view of this interest, we have extracted the title compound, (I), and present here its crystal structure.Compound (I) crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The re®ned molecular structure, together with the atom-labeling scheme, are shown in Fig. 1 (Johnson, 1965). All the bond distances and angles are close to normal values (Allen et al., 1983). The benzene ring C4±C9 in the central part of the molecule is very nearly planar, the maximum deviation of any of its atoms from the least-squares plane describing them being 0.0051 (8) A Ê , while the average deviation is 0.0030 (9) A Ê . Atoms (C2, C3, C16, O17, O18 and O19) around the benzene ring are coplanar [r.m.s. deviation 0.0535 (10) A Ê ]. Thus, the structure exhibits a planar central moiety, a typical structural feature observed in anti-leishmania inhibitors (Chan-Bacab & Pen Ä a-Rodrigues, 2001).Several packing features may be noted (Spek, 1990). There are classical intermolecular hydrogen bonds [O21Ð H21Á Á ÁO20 i ; symmetry code: (i) 1 2 À x, 1 2 À y, 1 À z] between the COOH groups of neighbouring molecules, forming a centrosymmetric dimer (Fig. 2). O21Á Á ÁO20 i is 2.6238 (12) A Ê and O21ÐH21Á Á ÁO20 i is 171.1 (17) .There is also a weak C16ÐH16BÁ Á ÁO21 ii [symmetry code: (ii) x, Ày, z À 1 2 ] intermolecular hydrogen bond that is responsible for stabilization of the in®nite parallel chains (Fig. 3). Furthermore, two intermolecular CÐHÁ Á Á% interactions involve atoms C15 and C16 and the % cloud of the benzene ring. The former is between atom H15A and the %ring of a molecule at (Àx, 1 À y, Àz) and the second between atom H16A and the molecule at (Àx, Ày, Àz). These are characterized by the distances C15Á Á ÁCgBz and C16Á Á ÁCgBz 
ExperimentalThe roots and leaves of A. fusci¯orus were collected in Manaus-AM/ Brazil in December 2000. An authenticated specimen was deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto de Pesquisas da Amazonia, INPA/ Brazil, reference code 189859. The powdered parts of the dihydrocinnamic acid title compound, isolated by extraction (roots 2.380 kg   The CÐHÁ Á Á% interactions in the structure of (I).Figure 1 A view of the molecular structure of (I), showing the atom-labeling scheme.

The hexane extract of the root (5.0 g) was chromatographed on an silica gel column (È Â h = 28 Â 2 cm) using a hexane/EtOAc gradient to fractionate the extract. Nine fractions were collected. Fraction 5 (hexane±ethyl acetate 7:3) was chromatographed on an silica gel column (È Â h = 50 Â 1.5 cm) using a gradient system of hexane, ethyl acetate and methylene chloride. 42 fractions were collected and, based on normal phase thin-layer chromatography (TLC), seven fractions were pooled. Fraction 3 (hexane/ethyl acetate/methylene chloride 7:2:1) produced an amorphous white solid (25 mg) that was washed successively with hexane and crystallized by vapor diffusion at room temperature from hexane/ methylene chloride (1:1). The purity of the compound was checked by TLC (silica gel, Merck PF 254, 0.25 mm thickness).
