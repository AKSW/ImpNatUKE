Chemistry and bioactivity of Raulinoa echinata Cowan, an endemic Brazilian Rutaceae species
The hexane extract of the stems of Raulinoa echinata afforded the sesquiterpenes germacrene D (6), 1β,6α-dihydroxy-4-(15)-eudesmene (4) and oplopanone (5); the triterpenes squalene, isomultiflorenol (7), isobauerenol (8) and friedelin (9); the protolimonoids melianone (2) and melianodiol (3); and the pyranocoumarin 3-(1'-1'-dimethylallyl)-lomatin (1), which has not been reported previously as a natural product; together with β-sitosterol. The hexane extract and some of these compounds were assayed in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Brine shrimp lethality and antimicrobial activities of the crude extract and pure compounds were also evaluated.

IntroductionThe subtribe Pilocarpinae (Rutoideae) is distributed throughout the American continent and includes the genus Raulinoa, first described by R. S. Cowan in 1960 (Cowan andSmith, 1973). This genus is monospecific and endemic to one region in Itajaí Valley, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Raulinoa echinata is a perennial woody shrub showing a high degree of adaptation to the rocky margins of the Itajaí river. As part of our interest in bioactive natural products, in this paper we describe the isolation, identification, antitrypanosomal activity, brine shrimp lethality, and antimicrobial activity of crude extracts and nine compounds from Raulinoa echinata. This is the first time that this species has been investigated.
Material and methods
Plant materialStems and leaves of R. echinata were collected in Ibirama, SC, Brazil and identified by A. Reis (Universi-0944-7113/01/08/02-121 $ 15.00/0 dade Federal de Santa Catarina) and J. R. Pirani (Universidade de São Paulo). Voucher specimens [A. Reis & M. Biavatti 2.570 (26/07/98)] were deposited at the Herbário Barbosa Rodrigues (HBR), Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil.
General experimental proceduresA Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for 1 H and 100.62 MHz for 13 C was used. The EIMS were obtained on a VG-Platform II mass spectrometer (70 eV). Optical rotations were measured using a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. HPLC separations were performed using a Shimadzu LC 8A pump [2.5 ml/min flow; Shandon Hypersil (5 µm) silica gel (35 cm × 1.2 cm i.d.) column; UV-VIS detector at 330 and 220 nm; and hexane-acetone (8:2) as eluent].
Extraction and IsolationThe dried and powdered stems (5 kg) were extracted with hexane and methanol. The hexane extract (40 g) The activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number in infected murine blood. b LC 50 value and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Probit Statistical Analysis Program. c Antimicrobial activity of stems hexane extract, fractions and pure compounds from R. echinata. Agar diffusion measured in mm. Concentrations tested were 1000, 500 and 100 µg/mL for crude extract, fractions and pure compounds, respectively. 
Bioactivity screeningIn vitro trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi (Y strain) and brine shrimp lethality (BSL) assays were performed according to established protocols (Alves et al. 1999;Alkofahi et al. 1989). Agar diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods (Bauer et al. 1996;Washington and Sutter, 1980) 
DiscussionThe bioassay results for the extract, fractions, and isolates are shown in Table 1. The pyranocoumarin 3-(1'-1'-dimethylallyl)-lomatin (1) is known only as product of synthesis. This is the first report of its isolation as a single enantiomer natural product displaying interesting in vitro activity against T. cruzi (IC 50 = 0.14 µg/ml). This compound was characterized by spectral data and literature comparison (Salvá et al. 1990). The absolute (S)-configuration of 1 [[α] D = +12.7 (c 0.04; CHCl 3 )] was determined by the Mosher method for secondary alcohols (Preite, 1994). Brine shrimp bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of the known cytotoxic protolimonoid melianone, identified through comparison of its spectral data with the literature (Itokawa et al. 1992;Nakanishi et al. 1986) (2), which showed an IC 50 value of 38 µg/ml corroborating that BSL is a good prescreen test for cytotoxicity. The results obtained here also reinforce the feasibility of the brine shrimp lethality bioassay as a pre-screen system to detect extracts active against T. cruzi, as suggested by Alves et al. (1999). Melianodiol (3) (LD 50 value = 2.6 µg/ml), also identified through comparison of its spectral data with the literature (Merrien and Polonsky, 1971), was less active than 2 (LD 50 value = 41 µg/ml).All extracts and pure compounds tested for antimicrobial activity were inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Among the microorganisms and compounds assayed, only B. subtilis, B. cereus, S. aureus and M. roseus were inhibited significantly by melianodiol (3) at 100 µg/ml; this compound showed a good diffusion on agar media, presenting activity against Gram-positive bacteria. These results are presented in Table 1. The MIC of melianodiol (3) was 50 µg/ml against B. subtilis and B. cereus and 25 µg/ml against S. aureus and M. roseus.Germacrene D ( 6) is frequently found in Rutaceae species; its prevalent occurrence may be significant in the communication between the plant and its environment, possibly as an insecticide (Marr and Tang, 1992). Germacrene D, identified through comparison of its spectral data with the literature (Kubeczka, 1979), showed a moderate in vitro trypanocidal activity (IC 50 value = 0.135 µg/ml), considering the reference chemoprophylatic drug crystal violet (IC 50 value of 7.5 µg/ml). Compound 1β,6α-dihydroxy-4-(15)-eudesmene (4) (Gutierrez and Herz, 1988) and oplopanone (5) (Herz and Watanabe, 1983) were characterized by comparison of their spectral data with the literature. This is the first report of these sesquiterpenes from Rutaceae. They did not display any significant activity on the models tested.The pentacyclic triterpenes isobauerenol (7) and isomultiflorenol (8) were inactive in all bioassays. Isolated as a mixture, these compounds were identified by comparison of 1 H and 13 C NMR, and EIMS data with literature values (Olea and Roque, 1990;Tanaka and Matsunaga, 1988). Friedelin (9) was also inactive and was identified based on comparison of 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR literature data (Ahmad and Rahman, 1994). Pentacyclic triterpenes are not common in the Rutaceae, but compound 9 has also been reported from the Rutoideae (Dreyer et al. 1972).It was observed that the crude extract presented increased activities when fractionated for BSL and antimicrobial activity. The fractions obtained were less active for trypanocidal activity than the crude extract.The results obtained in this study indicated the interesting phytochemical potential of Raulinoa echinata. Compounds 1 and 6 showed considerable activity against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, was compared with crystal violet. Based on these results, it is possible to drive future research toward new bioactive compounds, selecting active structural classes for synthetic or phytochemical survey.Fig. 1 Table 1 .11Fig. 1
