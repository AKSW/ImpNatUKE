signal, T 2.70-2.92 and 3.07-3-29) and ring A sustains hydrogens at C-6 and C-8 (T 4.08, s, [2H]). Only the signals due to these two aromatic protons suffer paramagnetic shifts upon acetylation of the compound (T 3.53 and 3.58, doublets, J 2-O Hz), a fact which establishes the presence of the hydroxyl at C-7 and leaves C-4' for the methoxyl.

Padmakastein is 2,3_dihydroprunetin, and, indeed, prunetin (5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyisoflavone) is found in the same plant.
