NEOLIGNANS FROM A NECTANDRA SPECIES*
The trunk wood of an Amazonian Nectandra (Lauraceae) species contains one bicyclo[3.2.l]octanoid and four hydrobenzofuranoid neolignans.The latter comprise representatives of the mirandin, the rearranged burchellin and the burchellin types. The former was characterized as (lS, 4R, .5S, 6R, 7R)-3-allyl-4-hydroxy-lmethoxy-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxypheny1)-7-methy1-8-oxobicyclo[3.2.l]oct-2-ene (macrophyllin-B), a new representative of the seemingly rare macrophyllin type.

INTRODUCTIONTrunk wood for the present study was collected from a lauraceous tree at Rosa de Maio, a locality on the Manaus-Itacoatiara highway (km 8), Amazonas, by DionisioCoelho. According to Dr. Klaus Kubitzki, Hamburg, the specimen, voucher Herbarium INPA, Manaus, No. 46.534 (20 February 1974), belongs to an unclassified Nectandra species. Indeed mirandin-A (la), which proved to be its major neolignan, is known to occur additionally in Nectandra miranda [2]. For reasons stated in a previous paper of this series [3], nomenclature and numbering of this and other neolignans follow the rules which were outlined in a recent review [4].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fractionationof the C6H6 extract gave crystalline mirandin-A (la), besides minor quantities of burchellin-type [4, 51 (2, 3a, 3b) and macrophyllintype [4, 61 (4a) neolignans.While la, 2 and 3a had been isolated previously from Nectandra miranda Sandw. [2]; from N. miranda [2] and Aniba simulans Allen [7]; and from A. afinis [8] and A. burchellii Kosterm.[9], respectively, and were thus identifiable by direct comparison with known compounds, 3b and 4a were novel neolignans.  heights. Since all other neolignans of the species under scrutiny sustain a tri-0-methylpyrogallyl substituent, it was immediatly suspected that this may be the case also for 3b, and account for the observed MS peaks. Indeed, the 60 MHz 'H NMR contained, besides the broad singlet at S 6.85 typical of the C-2, C-S and C-6 protons of a veratryl group, a fine singlet at S 6.55, compatible with the C-2 and C-6 protons of a pyrogallyl group. With the exception of the typical 3H-9 and 2H-7' signals, which appeared at slightly different frequencies, all other peaks for 3a and 3b in the spectrum of the mixture were coincident. A conclusive carbon-count for both compounds was given by a proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum. Significant differences of signal frequencies were noted solely for the carbons of the aromatic rings. All assignments [ 121. The centre at C-5' is not atfected, i.e. the methoxyl is not eliminated, since not only in MeOH. but also in EtOH, 7 is the sole reaction product. The aryl substituent in the end product 7 could thus appear cis-or rrans-oriented with respect to Me-S. OnI) the ITCUIS derivative (3H-9', 8 1.09) was obtained. All other substituents.however. must retain the ahsolutc configurational identity durmb I the transformation of la into 7.Spectral comparison of 7 and 4b. the oxidation product of 4a, showed the compounds to be contigurationally different. H-7 resonated at higher field in 7 (ii 2.47) than in 4a (S 2.60). a reflection of the relnti\c situations with respect to the C-2' carbonyl: H-7 is endo in 7, where it receives anisotropic shielding by the carbonyl and so H-7 is cxo in 4b. Analogously, H-6' resonated at lower field in 7 (6 7.051 than in 4b (8 6.75). a retlection of the relative situations with respect to the C-7 aryl and the C-8 methyl: Ar-7 mu>t he exo in 7. where it cannot exert anisotropic shielding on H-6' and must bc endo in 4b; Me-8 which is c~~rio in 7, where it exerts electronic repulsion on FI-6'. must be exe in 4b. The clearest evidence for the orientation of Ar-7 related to Me-S on one hand and to the carbonyl at C-2' on the other, however. was given h> 17C NMR data. C-9 of 7 (8 13.S) and C--2' of 4b iii 1X9.31 resonated at higher field than their counter-parts in the alternative compounds (C-Y of 4b at 6 1.5.6: C-2' of 7 at S lY4.2). a5 reflections of stronger y-effects within the cyclic systems. Contrasting clectronic interactions between the aryl and ring system arc evidenced also by the IR carbonyl absorptlons of 7 (v,,,, 1667 cm '1 vs 4b jv,,,, 1680 cm '1 (cf. [c)]).With the establishment of the relative configuration of 4b its absolute configuration could be deduced. Indeed, the ORD curve of 7 showed a positive Cotton effect at 307 nm and a negative Cotton effect at 282 nm assigned to the aryl and enone chrornophores. rcspcctively.Both these effects were positive in the case of 4b, revealing identical chirality for the benzylic C-7 and antipodal chirality for C-3' and C-5' vicinal to the enone group. According to these facts, and the above deduction of the relative configuration of the hydroxyl at C-4', structure 4a is proposed for the natural neolignan.The novel compound 4a is designated macrophyliin-B since it belongs to a neolignan type so far rep resented only by macrophyllin, now suffixed A. from A previous hydrobenzofuranoidbicyclo [3.2.l]octanoid rearrangement [12] was performed at room temperature [13]. Under the milder conditions, however, la isomerized to lb [2] (32%), and added the elements of water and methanol leading to the products 9a (18%) and 9b (31% This is defined by experimental evidence for C-6, C-7, and C-5', while construction of a model reveals the trans-ring juncture to be highly strained.Alternative cyclization modes of benzylic ions such as 10, whose preferred direction seems to be governed mainly by stereochemical factors [12], rationalizes the co-occurrence of 8.1'-linked neolignans of the burchellin(3) and guianin (11) type in extracts of Lauraceae species (cf. [9,11,131). Now that the co-occurrence of mirandin (1) and marcophyllin (4) types has been established, the relationship of the 8.5'4inked neolignans can be assumed to be mediated by intermediates such as 8. 2, and mixtures of 2, 3a, 3b and 3a, 3b.

by MS, allied to hydrogen. carbon and methoxyl counts by NMR. revealed the formula C,,H,,O, (OMe), for compound 4a suggesting another bis-arylpropanoid compound. Indeed, as in analogous cases [4], a prominent MS fragment ion at m/c 208 (45%) and the symmetry of the aryl substitution indicated by NMR data revealed the constitution of one of the C,C%-moieties (5). The additional C,C,-group had an ally1 on a trisubstituted double bond (2H-7', S 3.00, tl, J = 7 Hz). The fact that the only vinylic proton (H-6'. ?i 5.62) was represented by a singlet with only allylic broadening indicated vicinality of this methine to a tetrasubstituted carbon. 'This double bond was part of a secondary ally1 alcohol since oxidation of the compound with MnO, led to an a.@-unsaturated ketone (4b. v,,, 1680 cm '), a transformation which produced a 1.13 ppm paramagnetic shift of the olefinic p (H-6') proton. The secondary nature of the alcohol was confirmed by acctylation. The doublet (6 4.72, .I = 5 Hz) due to the carbinolic proton (H-2') suffered a I.08 ppm paramagnetic shift. The multiplicity of this signal indicated the vicinity of a further methine. Since the signal of the corresponding proton appeared at 6 2.60, the yet unassigned methoxyl (6 3.54) could only be situated at the previously mentioned tetrasubstituted carbon. The carbonyl (v,,,, 17.50 cm '). which must link these trisubstituted and tetrasubstituted carbons in order to complete the C,-unit 6. was also part of the H 'OH S 6 pentacycle formed by joining 5 and 6. Of the two ways this can be done. 4a alone must represent the correct alternative. Indeed, there was a slight coupling (J,,,,tr._q. = 0.8 Hz) between the bridgehead and the benzylic protons. The interpretations of this, as well as all other proton couplings, were confirmed by a complete series of decoupling experiments at 270 MHz. The relative configurations of the substituents of the bicyclo[3.2. I]oct-2-ene skeleton of 4a were deduced from the 3H-9 proton signal at relatively low field (6 1.05) indicative of the Me/Ar truns-relationship. and the coupling constant between H-2'. H-3' (5 Hz) which was, according to the Karplus equation, compatible only with the p&o-configuration for the hydroxyl at C
