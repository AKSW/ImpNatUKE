3C NMR SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF LIGNANS FROM ARAUCARIA ANGUSTIFOLIA"
Pinoresinol dimethylether, secoisolariciresinol, lariciresinol, isolariciresinol and isolariciresinol-4'methyl ether were isolated from the knots of dead trees of Araucaria angustifolia. The 13C NMR spectra of these compounds, their methyl and acetyl derivatives, and the corresponding one of matairesinol, have been recorded and the signals assigned. On the basis of these assignments, the structure of the new monomethyl ether of isolariciresinol has been established.

INTRODUCTIONIn continuation with the work on the constituents of Araucaria angustifolia 0. Ktze, [l] the components of the knot benzene extract were examined.By Si gel column chromatography the following lignans were 499 Za, lariciresinol 4a, isolariciresinol 6g, and a monoMe ether of 6g, not previously described in the literature, 6e. The availability of representative members of the main classes of lignans [2] and the considerable interest focused on the 13C NMR spectral studies of this and related families ofnatural products, [3][4][5][6] prompted us to undertake an analysis of these substances, as an aid in the structure elucidation of new compounds and also, as part of a project on the 13C NMR spectroscopy of natural products [7].  Some MeOH had been added for dissolution of the compound.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTable 1 shows the 6 values of compounds 24c, since the shifts of compound 1. has already been reported [3]. The spectra of secoisolariciresinol, 2a. shows 10 signals which were assigned on the basis of chemical shift theory [8], comparison with shifts of related products [5] and analysis of the SFORD spectrum. The transformation of2a into its tetraacetyl derivative 2b. causes the expected changes and confirms the above assignment.The nonaromatic carbons of matairesinol 3a [ll] have their shift assigned by comparison with the recently reported 6 values of like carbons of pluviatolide and hinokinin. 3b and 3c, respectively [IS]. Although differences can be observed in the shifts of comparable sites of both benzene rings of3a. they are too small to be analyzed. In lariciresinol4a.however, the differences ofthe aromatic carbon shifts are larger and they were assigned by comparison with related products, compound 2a for ring A and the neolignan licarin A, 5 [5] for ring B. For the assignment of the aromatic carbons of 6a, an exhaustive analysis of the spectra of the monomethyl ether 6c. obtained by careful methylation of isolariciresinol, the monomethyl ether isolated from A. angusti-f&n, 6e, and their corresponding di-and triacetyl derivatives 6b, 6d and 6f, was undertaken.The aromatic methines were assigned by their multiplicities in the SFORD spectrum, standard chemical shift theory [S] and comparison of the shifts of the 6 compounds with each other. Comparison of the quaternary carbon shift data of 6a, 6c and 6d, permits the assignment of the signals at 128.1 and 137.6 ppm of 6a. to C-l' and C-6'isolated : pinoresinol diMe ether-CMe * Dedicated to the memory of Professor Jayr de Paiva Campello.

5Carbon-l', C-2' and C-6' are shielded, probably by steric compression, and C-4' is deshielded, in relation to the same carbons of ring A. The nonaromatic carbons of 4a were assigned by standard chemical shift theory, analysis of the SFORD spectrum and expected changes on acetylation, 4b. Carbon-7 and C-9' exhibit also the shielding effect observed on C-l', C-2' and C-6'. and resonate upfield in comparison with C-7 and C-9 of 2a. The assignment of 4c was based on the same arguments. ThenonaromaticcarbonsofisolariciresinoldiMeether 6a, were split into two groups on the basis of their signal multiplicities from a SFORD spectrum. which shows triplets at 33.2, 62.6 and 66.2 ppm and doublets at 39.9. 48.0 and 48.2 ppm. The 33.2 ppm signal was assigned to C-7' and the remaining ones to C-9' and C-9, using trans-4-t-butylcyclohexylmethanol as reference [9]. The A6 = R, = H; R, = R, = Me 6h: Rr = R, = -OC-Me; R, = R, = Me 6c R,=R,=R,=H;R,=Me 6d: R, = R, = R, = --CC-Me: R, = Me 6e. R, = R, = R, = H: R, = Me 6f. R, = R, = R, = -OC-Me: R, = Me 6g R, = R, = R, zz R, = H 6b R, = Rz = R, = R, = -CC-Me value of the carbinyl carbon shift of the model compound (68.9 ppm) and that of C-9' (66.2 ppm). which is similar in magnitude to that observed in the methylcyclohexane to trans-dimethylcyclohexane change (AS = 2.5 ppm), can be explained by the reciprocal ;*-effect of both carbinyl carbons. On C-9 this effect is enhanced by the vicinal aryl group. The methines at 39.9.48 and 48.2 ppm were distinguished by analysis of the corresponding diacetyl derivatrve, 6b, carbon shifts. and comparison with the shifts of related carbons of tmns-dimethylcyclohexane, 7. and phenylcyclohexane, 8 [8]. As expected. acetylation induces deshielding of the carbinyl carbons [IO] and shielding of their neighbours by magnitudes normal for saturated alcohols: the signal at 48 ppm, which is practically unaffected in the transformation can be therefore. assigned to C-7. The distinction of remaining methines is founded on the fact that C-8. which suffers an n-effect by C-Y, and two b-effects by C-9' and the dimethoxybenzene ring. should be deshielded in comparison to C-8'.
