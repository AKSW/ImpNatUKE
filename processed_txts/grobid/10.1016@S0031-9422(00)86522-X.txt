PELTOGYNOIDS OF GONIORRHACHIS MARGINATA*
Two novel types of natural peltogynoids represented by the flavanones (Vb), (Ve) and (Vg) and the chalcone (VIc) were encountered during the examination of the heartwood constituents of Goniorrhachis marginata Taub.

INTRODUCTIONGoniorrhachis marginatu Taub., known in Brasil by the trivial name guarabd, belongs to a monotypic genus of the Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae which is closely akin to Peltogyne.2 In the present paper we wish to report on the structure of four crystalline constituents of its heartwood. As had been anticipated, they are peltogynoids. The types of known natural products associated with the peltogynane skeleton (I)3 are represented by compounds which can be formally related to anthocyanidin (II), 4a flavan-3,4-diol (III),4 flavonol (IV)48*5 and dihydroflavonol (V).6*7 In a similar way, the new compounds contain either flavanone (Vb, Ve, Vg) or chalcone (VIc) nuclei. The first compound, C,GH,09(OH),0Me, showed spectral characteristics (A,,, 286 run, E 20 500) suggestive of a flavanone or a 3-hydroxyflavanone constitution.8v9 Indeed, upon addition of base, the intense absorption maximum (AmaX 330 nm, E 30 400) typical of the chalcone chromophore appeared. No hydroxyl being present at C-5 (absence of a UV-shift upon addition of AICl,-HCI), such a group must be located at C-7; acetylation of the compound resulted in the shift of the IR-carbonyl absorption from 1675 to 1700 cm-'. The PMR spectrum of the acetate (Vd, Table 1) lacked a signal at characteristically low field, precluding the existence also of hydrogen on C-5. It became imperative, therefore, to locate the methoxyl at this position. The analysis of the ring A of the flavanone was thus complete, since the PMR-spectrum indicated the presence of a pair of meta-related aromatic protons (T 3.46 and 3.62, doublets, J 2.0 Hz) which cannot be located on ring C (see below). The spectrum of the tri-O-acetyl derivative contained, furthermore, signals assignable to a methylene group (T 5.02, s; cf. the ring-D CH, signal of peltogynol tetraacetate: 7 5.19, s),4b and to a pair of vicinal protons (7 4.70, dd, J 12.0 and 0.5 Hz, T 5.66, d, J 12.0 Hz; cf. the trans 2H,3H signals of 3-hydroxyflavanones: 7 4.4 and 5.6, doublets, J 12 Hz)." The secondary splitting of the 2-H signal revealed benzylic coupling with a 2'-proton on the ring C. The PMR signals due to this and the remaining benzenoid proton are substantially singlets, a fact which defines their para-relationship.The constitutional proposal (Vb), which thus emerged for this compound, was confirmed, if only with respect to skeleton and oxygenation pattern, by transformation of its trimethyl ether (Vc) into the chalcone Via. This was fully characterized by analysis of its PMR spectrum ( Comparison of the spectral data of Vb with those of the second and third Goniorrhachis compounds led to constitutional proposals also for them. Indeed the only significant difference in 'the spectra of the triacetates of Vb and Ve, i.e. Vd and C16H803 (OAc),OMe (Vf, Table l), refers to the PMR-signals due to the two aromatic protons on ring-C. Benzylic coupling of the proton at C-2 to the proton at the 2'-position is still observed in the derivative of Ve. The 2'-H signal is here, however, substantially a doublet (J 8.5 Hz), indicating the vicinal relationship of the two protons on ring C, and leading to the constitution Ve for the second flavanone.   
The MS of compoundsVb, Ve and Vg were consistent with the proposed constitutions, and are interpretable according to the fragmentation paths proposed for the synthetic trimethyl ethers of peltogynone (Vh) and mopanone (Vk)" (Table 3). (+)-Tri-O-methylpeltogynone (Vh) and (+)-tri-0-methylmopanone (Vk) were also helpful in the assignment of the absolute configurations (2R,3R) to the new flavanones. Indeed, the published ORD curves for the synthetic derivatives4b are very similar among themselves and to the curves obtained for our natural isolates (Table 4). The similarity of the curves of Vh and Vk indicates that the differences in substitution pattern do not invalidate stereochemical assignments based on the comparison of ORD-curves in this field. * These data were taken from a small graph and are subject to error of X & 2 pm, 10-J[+] hO.5.The intense yellow colour and typical UV spectrum (A,,, 395 nm, E 16 500) characterized the fourth compound, C16Hs02(OH)4, as a chalcone. The complete structure WC was easily deduced from the PMR (Table 2) and MS (Table 3 and flavanones are considered primitive characters, while absence of the Shydroxyl group constitutes an advanced character. Both these criteria point to Goniorrhachis as a remnant of the previously possibly widespread ancestors to Peltogyne and related genera. EXPERIMENTAL M.ps were determined using a Kofler hot stage microscope and are uncorrected. Separations were carried out using either Merck Kieselgel 0.05-0.20 mm (column chromatography) or Merck Kieselgel G (TLC) PMR spectra were determined using Varian instruments. For symbols see notes to Tables 1 and2. MS were determined with an AEI, model MS9, spectrometer. Only peaks of m/e z 100 and intensity > 5 % are quoted. The ORD curves were registered on a Bendix Polarmatic 62 instrument. The methyl ethers were prepared by reflux.in Me&O with Me$O.+-K,CO,.The acetates were prepared with A@-pyridine at room temp. Isolation of the consrituents of Goniorrhachis marginata. The powdered heartwood (4.6 kg) was successively extracted with benzene and EtOH. The EtOH solution was evaporated and the residue (400 g) was chromatographed on silica, yielding the following useful fractions with the indicated eluants: F1 (CHCls-MeOH 98 :2), Fz (CHCl,-MeOH 98:3), FB (CHCl,-MeOH 98:6), Fq (CHCl,-MeOH 98 :7). Upon slow evaporation of the solvent, F1 gave crystals which were filtered and rechromatographed on silica. Upon slow evaporation of the fraction eluted with CHC13-MeOH 98 :2, crystals aupeared. These were collected by filtration and washed with CHC13, giving VIc (300 mg). F2 was evaporated iid the residue was rechromatographed on silica, using CHCIJ-MeOH 97:3 as eluant. Evaporation of the solvent produced Vg (500 mg). Fa and Fb were evaporated. The residues were washed with MeOH and recrystallized from MeOH, giving respectively Vb (400 mg) and Ve (100 mg).    Notes to Tables1 and 2. The spectra were registered in CDCla solution at 60 MHz (Vd,f,i; VIa,d), 100 MHz (Vk) and 220 MHz (Vh), or in (CD&CO solution at 220 MHz (VIc). TMS was used as internal reference. + Signal included in an unresolved multiplet 7 2.8-3.0, representing four protons. Multiplicity (M) of bands, if omitted, refers to singlets. s singlet, d doublet, dd double doublet, b broad. In contradistinction, the only significant difference in the PMR spectra of the triacetates of Vb and Vg, i.e. Vd and C16H903 (OAc), (Vi, Table l), refers to the signals due to the substituents of ring A. In the derivative of the third flavanone, the methoxyl of Vb is clearly replaced by an additional aromatic proton. The chemical shift and multiplicity (T 1.95, dd, J 8.5 and 2-O Hz) of its PMR signal places it at the deprotected 5-position, ortho and para related with the two other protons of ring A, leading to the constitution Vg for the third flavanone. In confirmation of this, Me2S04-K,C03 methylation gave a trimethyl ether which proved to be identical, by direct comparison, with the oxidation product of tri-Omethylpeltogynol Vh.
). In confirmation, treatment with acid yielded a flavanone (Vj, disregard indication of stereochemistry), whose trimethyl ether was indistinguishable from tri-0-methylmopanone (Vk)3b by TLC and IR spectrometry.
