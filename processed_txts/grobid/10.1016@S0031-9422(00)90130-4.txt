PTEROCARPANOIDS FROM DALBERGIA DECZPULARIS*
Plant. Dalbergia decipularis Rizz. and Matt.,2 trivial name 'sebastiPo de arruda', tree.Source. Andarai, central Bahia, Brazil. Uses. The compact, fragrant heartwood has beautiful pink streaks and is used for fine furniture and flooring.3Heartwood. Extraction with benzene produced a solution which was filtered and concentrated under vacuum. Upon standing a precipitate appeared. This was separated by filtration and crystallized from acetone giving (f)-3-hydroxy-9-methoxypterocarpan, m.p. and m.m.p. with an authentic sample,4 195-197". The filtrate was evaporated and extracted with boiling light petroleum. The soluble portion was an oil whose purification by distillation under vacuum (98-99", O-4 mm) gave practically pure nerolidol. The insoluble portion was chromatographed on silica, giving upon elution with benzene 3,9-dimethoxy-pterocarpda-en, m.p. 115-116" (lit. m.p. 11O",5 116"6); and with AcOEt (+)-3-hydroxy-9methoxypterocarpan, m.p. and m.m.p. with an authentic sample,4 127-128"; 3,9dimethoxy-6-oxopterocarp-6a-en, m.p. 200-201" (subl.) (lit.' m.p. 196-198"); and an aliphatic ester, m.p. 245-247", M-498. The identification involved NMR, IR, UV and mass spectral measurements. The base peak of the mass spectrum of 3,9-dimethoxy-6-oxopterocarp-6a-en is associated with the loss of a methyl group.Phytochemical comments. Nerolido17 and the pterocarpans4 were isolated previously from other Dalbergiu species. The pterocarpens have only recently been reported5 as constituents of Swartzia madagascariensis. Dalbergia decipularis seems thus chemically closer to a species of the Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae than indeed to its proper papilionaceous entourage.
