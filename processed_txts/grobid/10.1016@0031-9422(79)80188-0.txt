LIGNANS OF ARAUCARIA ANGUSTIFOLZA AND 13C NMR ANALYSIS OF SOME PHENYLTETRALIN LIGNANS
Secoisolariciresinol monomethylether and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether were isolated from the knots of dead trees of Araucariu angustifolia. On the basis of spectral evidence, the position of the OH group was located in these compounds.The 13C NMR spectra of the phenyltetralin lignans galbulin, galcatin, isogalcatin and cyclogalgravin have also been recorded and the signals assigned, based on the methyl shifts of cyclogalgravin.

INTRODUCTIONContinuing our investigations on the constituents of the knots of Araucuriu ungustifoliu 0. Ktze [l], we have now isolated pinoresinol la and its monoMe ether lc, previously reported from the same source by Anderegg and Rowe [2]* and two new monophenolic lignans, secoisolariciresinol monoMe ether 2a and lariciresinol-4-Me ether 3ct. The determination of the position of the phenolic OH groups of 2a and 3c, deduced by comparison of their O-Me derivatives with known products and by application of spectroscopic techniques, together with some comments on the effects of acetylation on the 13C NMR shifts of la and lc and the 13C NMR analysis of some phenyltetralin lignans, forms the basis of this report.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMS fragmentation pattern, M+, and 'H NMR spectrum of 2a indicate a secoisolariciresinol lignan-type skeleton. The base peak at m/e 151 and the peak at m/e 137, together with the OMe proton signals (6 3.80 (6H) and 3.85 (3H)), suggested the presence of a dimethoxy group and a methoxyhydroxybenzyl group. On acetylation, 2a yielded a triacetyl derivative 2b, whose 'H NMR signals confirm the above observations and further show, on the basis of the doublet at 6 6.87 (J = 7 Hz), that a guaiacyl unit is present in 2a. Further confirmation of the structure of the secoisolariciresinol monoMe ether was obtained by analysis of its 13C NMR spectrum. The carbon shifts of 2a, its triacetyl derivative 2b, the O-Me ether 2c and its diacetyl derivative 2d (Table 1) show the expected effects in comparison with the previously reported ones for secoisolariciresinol and its tetraacetate [ 11. * This reference, in which the isolation of la, lb, pinoresinol diMe ether, hinokiresinol, isolariciresinol and secoisolarici-resin01 from the knots of A. angu@lia is described, was not cited in [l] since our main interest was the 13C NMR spectral analysis of this group of natural products.tThe nomenclature and numbering are those used in our previous publication [l].  of the alternative structure 3e by careful methylation of 3a. The shifts showed by C-4 of 3e and its diacetyl derivative 3f are the expected ones, in agreement with the above results. The carbon shifts of compounds 3c-3f, together with the shifts of the acetate of lariciresinol diMe ether 3g, not previously reported, are listed in Table 2.An analysis of the shifts of C-l and C-l' of lariciresinol 3a and its derivatives--mainly the diacetates 3d and 3findicates that our previous assignments at 133.7 and 131.6 ppm, respectively [I], based on a comparison with the shifts of related carbons of the guaiacyl units of secoisolariciresinol and the neolignan licarin A, were not correct. As shown in Table 2, by reversal of these two assignments a more consistent set of shifts is obtained. Further support for the new assignment is obtained by comparison of C-l' shift of 3a (Table 2) with related carbons of the benzofurans 4a (134.5 ppm) and 4b (134.3 ppm) [3]. Although the stereochemistry of 4a and 4b is not indicated in reference [3], they probably represent better models than the previously selected one for C-l'.That the phenolic OH in 3c is located at C-4' was confirmed by comparative 'H NMR and MS analysis of 3c and 3e, and their corresponding diacetyl and O-Me derivatives 3d, 3f and 3g, respectively. As was previously observed in sanshodiol 5 [4], acetylation of the OH at C-4' induces small, but significant changes on the benzylic proton signal at C-7' of 3c (deshielding of cu 5 Hz and decrease of J value), while the comparable proton signal of3e is unaffected in the transformation (3e -+ 3f).*The designation 8.8', 7.2'-neolignan has also been suggestedfor the members of this group of natural products.In agreement with these results, the MS of the diacetate 3d shows as its base peak the ion m/e 151, assigned by accurate mass measurements to the ions 6a and 7a, arising via benzylic (a) and path b cleavages, 8 [5], with ketene elimination, respectively.The benzylic cleavage of 3g also gives rise to a base peak at m/u 15 1, as expected from the presence of a dimethoxybenzyl moiety, while in 3b and 3f, the same benzylic cleavage with loss of ketene produces base peaks at m/e 137, 6b. Further, in 3f and 3g the fragment at m/e 165, 7b, arising by path b is also detected.The observed effects of acetylation on the 'H NMR signal of the benzylic protons adjacent to the guaiacyl units of 2,6-diaryl-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.O]octane lignans, such as pluviatilol and xanthoxylol [4; 61, prompted us to compare the 13C NMR shifts of those carbons of pino-resin01 la, its monoMe ether lc and the acetyl derivatives lb and Id, hoping to detect features that could be used to supplement previous studies [6,7] for the structure elucidation of other members of this group of natural products. However, as in the case of the monoMe ethers of Iariciresinol 3c and 3e, acetylation of the phenolic OH produces the known effects on the aromatic carbons of la and lc, while the benzylic ones are practically unaffected. The carbon shifts of compounds la--ld, assigned on the basis of previous results [6, 71, on 13C-'H longrange couplings and on specific proton decoupling data, are listed in Table 3.Following our "C NMR spectral studies on lignans 183, the analysis of the natural phenyltetralins with identical relative configurations at C-7, C-8 and C-8', galbulin 9a, galcatin 9b and isogalcatin 9c [9]*, together with cyclogalgravin 10, easily obtained by acid treatment of tetrahydrofuran lignan galgravin [lo], was carried out. Table 4 lists the carbon shifts of compounds 9a, 9b and 9c, assigned on the basis of their multiplicity in the  The carbon shifts of cyclogalgravin 10, based on a comparison with those of 9a, on the analysis of the sford spectrum and on the effects produced by the introduction of a double bond on the endocyclic homoallylic positions [12], are listed in Table 4 and 9c, reveals some information about the conformation of 10. Galbulin, 9a, and its relatives 9b and 9c, possess the same relative configuration of the substituents on ring B and it would be expected to prefer a half-chair conformation with the phenyl and both methyls at pseudoequatorial positions, as was shown by 'H NMR spectroscopy [13]. On the assumption that a neighbouring double bond does not affect the chemical shift of a Me group [14], it could be expected that the flattening of ring B, because of the introduction of the double bond between C-7' and C-8' in 10, will induce a shielding effect on the Me groups as a consequence of the decrease in the dihedral angle between them. In cyclogalgravin 10, however, the Me groups are deshielded compared with those of 9a, 9b and 9c, indicating a preferred conformation previously suggested for 1,2_dihydronaphthalenes Lariciresinol-4'-monoMe ether, 3e. Lariciresinol, 3a (0.3 g) in containing l-10% MeOH, furnishing pinoresinol (la), its MeOH was treated with CH,N,-Et,O, at 10". When the monoMe ether (lb), secoisolariciresinol monoMe ether (2~) and dimethylated product was detected on TLC, excess reagent was lariciresinol-4-methyl ether (3c), the monoMe ethers being evaporated and the residue chromatographed on a Si gel H eluted before their respective diphenols.

As expected, and according to the known effects of an OH group on the a, fi and y carbons, C-9, C-9', C-8 and C-8' are shielded while C-7 and C-7' are deshielded in 9a, 9b and 9c in comparison to related sites of 11. The replacement of the 3',4'-dimethoxy groups of 9s and 9c by the methylenedioxy unit of 9b, produces the expected changes on the ring A carbon shifts, i.e. shielding of C-3', C-4', C-2' and C-5' and deshielding of C-l' and C-6' by magnitudes similar to those previously observed [l 11. A comparison of the essentially identical ring C shifts of 9a and 9b with the corresponding ones of9c shows again the expected changes, shielding of C-3, C-4, C-2 and C-5 and deshielding of C-l and C-6, allowing the assignment of most of the aromatic shifts of 9a, 9b and 9c. Comparison of the aromatic shifts of 9a with those found for isolariciresinol diMe ether 11 shows significant differences for the shifts at 131.7 and 137.6 ppm assigned to C-l and C-6, respectively [l]. It then seems reasonable, on the basis of the present results, to reverse the previous assignment.

Distinction of some close resonances like those of C-6 and C-7', and C-l and C-8' was made by specific proton decoupling and "C-'H long-range couplings, while the signals at 126.9 and 127.1 ppm remain for C-l' and C-6' or vice versa.
