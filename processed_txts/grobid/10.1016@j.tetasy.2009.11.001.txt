Asymmetric microbial reduction of ketones: absolute configuration of trans-4-ethyl-1-(1S-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanol
A set of five fungal species, Botrytis cinerea, Trichoderma viride and Eutypa lata, and the endophytic fungi Colletotrichum crassipes and Xylaria sp., was used in screening for microbial biocatalysts to detect monooxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities (for the stereoselective reduction of carbonyl compounds). 4-Ethylcyclohexanone and acetophenone were biotransformed by the fungal set. The main reaction pathways involved reduction and hydroxylations at several positions including tertiary carbons. B. cinerea was very effective in the bioreduction of both substrates leading to the chiral alcohol (S)-1phenylethanol in up to 90% enantiomeric excess, and the cis-trans ratio for 4-ethylcyclohexanol was 0:100. trans-4-Ethyl-1-(1S-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanol, obtained from biotransformation by means of an acyloin-type reaction, is reported here for the first time. The absolute configurations of the compounds trans-4-ethyl-1-(1S-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanol and 4-(1S-and 4-(1R-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanone were determined by NMR analysis of the corresponding Mosher's esters.

IntroductionInterest in integrating traditional organic chemistry and biocatalysis has increased dramatically over the past decade. 1 Biocatalytic reactions that employ either enzymes or whole cells are well suited for green chemistry because mild conditions are applied in these reactions by lowering the energy requirements; fewer by-products are formed as they are highly chemo-, regio-and stereoselective, and multi-step chemical syntheses can be achieved in just a few steps via biocatalysis. 2 As a result, biocatalytic processes are often cheaper and more direct than their chemical counterparts. 3 The use of microorganisms is advantageous because of the growth and easy formation of the multienzymatic system. 4 One crucial aspect to be considered for a successful microbial biotransformation is the selection of the natural source to be studied. In this work, whole cells from three filamentous fungi and two endophytic fungi were tested as biocatalysts. Endophytic fungi are an unexplored or at least under-explored source for microbial biotransformations. 5 Therefore, as a part of our research program focusing on the study of the biocatalytic potential of filamentous fungi, we herein report the biotransformation of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1 and aceto-phenone 2, two well-known pro-chiral ketones, by the filamentous fungi Botrytis cinerea, Trichoderma viride and Eutypa lata, and the endophytic microorganisms Colletotrichum crassipes and Xylaria sp., in order to detect monooxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities. 6,7 
Results and discussionThe selected set of five fungal species mentioned above was used in the screening of microbial biocatalysts to detect monooxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities. The reduction of 4ethylcyclohexanone 1 to 4-ethylcyclohexanol 1a was used as the first reaction in the screening.
Biotransformation of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 14-Ethylcyclohexanone 1 was subjected to the action of whole cells of five filamentous fungi, B. cinerea, E. lata, T. viride, C. crassipes and Xylaria sp. to verify the biocatalytic potential of these fungi in the biotransformation of ketones. The results of the biotransformations are presented in Tables 1 (static cultures) and 2 (shaken cultures) in terms of isolated yields and the predominant configurations of the products obtained. Shaken cultures were included in order to observe differences resulting from the degree of oxidation. Following a period of incubation for each fungus, several biotransformation products 1a-1e were detected. Product structure assignment was done by NMR analysis as described in Section 4.4-Ethylcyclohexanone 1 was reduced to the corresponding cisand trans-alcohols 8 (Scheme 1). As shown in Tables 1 and2, B. cinerea and C. crassipes gave the trans-4-ethylcyclohexanol trans-1a with a cis-trans ratio of 0:100, and E. lata with a cis-trans ratio of 3:97 and a yield of $47%. cis-alcohol 1a was produced by T. viride with a cis-trans ratio of 65:35. Most of the biotransformations occurred with low conversion because several products were formed. cinerea gave the trans-isomer with 56.1% ee. In contrast, C. crassipes afforded the cis-isomer suggesting that the compound cis-4-ethylcyclohexanol cis-1a was hydroxylated by this fungus on the ethyl group.The stereoselective formation of carbon-carbon bonds is one of the key transformations in synthetic organic chemistry and is gaining increasing attention. Enzymatic systems belonging to the lyase class such as pyruvate decarboxylases are capable of carrying out acyloin-type condensation reactions in water under mild conditions, in turn leading to chiral a-hydroxy ketones which are versatile building blocks for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.In some cases, these a-hydroxy ketones are not isolated but an erythro diol is formed instead. 10 Thus, compound 1c was obtained from biotransformation by T. viride and E. lata as a colourless oil with an M + peak at m/z 172 and featuring a 13 C NMR spectrum consistent with the molecular formula C 10 H 20 O 2 . The 1 H NMR spectrum was close to that of 4-ethylcyclohexanol 1a, but the appearance of two signals at 74.6 and 17.1 ppm in the 13 C NMR spectrum (C-9 and C-10, respectively) and two signals at 1.15 and 3.52 ppm in the 1 H NMR spectrum showed that 1c presented another hydroxylated ethyl group. The trans disposition was deduced from NOE interactions H-4/H-10. The absolute configuration at C-9 was determined via the Mosher ester analysis protocol. 11 In particular, derivatization of 1c with (R)-and (S)-a-methoxy-a-phenylacetic (MPA) acids followed by 1 H NMR analysis of the resulting diastereomeric esters (S)-MPA-1c and (R)-MPA-1c revealed a negative d (dR À dS) value for H-10 (À0.14) and positive d (dR À dS) values for H-2 and H-4 (+0.10 and +0.46, respectively). Following MPA rules, these data indicated an S-configuration for C-9 in 1c which is consistent with Prelog's rule. 12 This compound, trans-4-ethyl-1-(1S-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanol (1c), is reported here for the first time.
OH OFungi  The formation of 1c can be explained assuming the formation of a C-C bond by means of an enzyme-type pyruvate decarboxylase leading to a chiral a-hydroxy ketone. The two-carbon unit originating from the decarboxylation of pyruvate is transferred to the ketone substrate. Presumably, an alcohol dehydrogenase present in the whole cell stereoselectively reduces the ketone of the acyloin and an erythro diol is formed instead. This is the first time that an acyloin-type enzymatic reaction with a ketone as substrate is reported. We propose the mechanism showed in Scheme 2.1 cis-1a + trans-1a OH Scheme 1. Reduction of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1.Another interesting transformation of 1 was oxidation at tertiary carbon C-4 by the endophytic fungus Xylaria sp. which is unusual for fungal biotransformations. 4-Ethyl-4-hydroxycyclohexanone 1d had been previously prepared 13 but it is reported here for the first time as a biotransformation product.The biotransformation of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1 by the endophytic fungi Xylaria sp. and C. crassipes also produced another compound, 1e, whose 13 C NMR spectrum was consistent with the molecular formula C 8 H 14 O 2 , exhibiting signals for one methyl, four methylene, two methyne and one quaternary carbon. The 1 H NMR spectrum was close to that of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1, but the presence of a signal at 70.7 ppm in the 13 C NMR spectrum (C-7) and two signals at 3.73 ppm (q, 1H) and 1.25 ppm (d, 3H) in the 1 H NMR spectrum suggest that this compound was hydroxylated at C-7. The stereochemistry of this product was confirmed by means of the corresponding Mosher esters. 11 According to this method, we analysed the 1 H NMR spectra of the MPA esters of compound 1e resulting from the biotransformation by Xylaria sp. on surface cultures at 10 days. The positive value of Dd RS for H-8 (+0.15) and the negative value of Dd RS for H-4 and H-6 (À0.59 and À0.14, respectively) indicate an R configuration for this compound, with ½a 25 D ¼ À3:5 (c 1.0, CHCl 3 ). The same compound 1e obtained from C. crassipes showed a positive value for ½a 25 D , suggesting an S-configuration for C-7.4-(1-Hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanone 1e had been previously prepared 14 but its absolute configuration is reported here for the first time.These compounds 1d and 1e were only obtained by the endophytic fungi Xylaria sp. and C. crassipes, indicating the different biocatalytic potential of these fungi.
Biotransformation of acetophenone 2Acetophenone 2 was biotransformed by whole cells of five filamentous fungi, B. cinerea, E. lata, T. viride, C. crassipes and Xylaria sp. to verify the biocatalytic potential of these fungi for the biotransformation of aromatic ketones (Scheme 3). The results of the biotransformations are presented in Tables 3 (static cultures) and 4 (shaken cultures) in terms of isolated yields, enantiomeric excesses and the predominant configurations of the products obtained. Shaken cultures were included in order to observe the differences due to the degree of oxidation in the compounds obtained.In order to evaluate the alcohol dehydrogenase activity for each fungus under study, we selected the time for the biotransformation. The absolute configurations were attributed by comparison with those from the literature. 15,16 The most enantioselective strain for the bioreduction reaction was B. cinerea, which gave (S)-1-phenylethanol (S)-2a 15 with high enantiomeric excess (85%) and conversion (54.3%) on surface cultures, and 92% ee and 23% yield on shaken cultures. The (S)-configuration is consistent with Prelog's rule. 12 T. viride showed enantiopreference for the (R)-alcohol (R)-2a with a high enantiomeric excess (79%). Therefore, depending on the configuration of the chiral alcohol required, either B. cinerea or T. viride can be used.The data presented in tables show that the enantiomeric excess decreased with the fermentation time, except for the shaken culture of B. cinerea. This is because in both cases the highest enantiomeric excess was reached after five days.It is interesting to note that C. crassipes was the only fungus which gave the hydroxylation product of 2a at C-2, phenylethane-1,2-diol 2b, 16 with (S)-configuration and high enantiomeric excess.  
ConclusionsIn summary, the studies described above demonstrate the biocatalytic potential of the filamentous fungi B. cinerea, T. viride, E. lata, C. crassipes and Xylaria sp. in obtaining biotransformation compounds with high enantiomeric purity from prochiral ketones. The main reaction paths involved reduction and hydroxylations at several positions including tertiary carbons. The latter case is not very typical in fungal biotransformations. Thus, 4-ethyl-4-hydroxycyclohexanone 1d is obtained by the endophytic fungus Xylaria sp.4-Ethylcyclohexanone 1 was reduced to the corresponding cis and trans-alcohols by all the fungi with medium to high enantiomeric purity, except by Xylaria sp. B. cinerea was very effective in the bioreduction of both substrates leading to the chiral alcohol (S)-1-phenylethanol (S)-2a with up to 90% enantiomeric excess and the ratio of cis-and trans-4-ethylcyclohexanol 1a was shown to be 0:100.Moreover, the absolute configurations of the compounds trans-4-ethyl-1-(1S-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanol 1c and 4-(1R-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanone 1e were determined by NMR analysis of the corresponding Mosher's esters. The first one, 1c, reported here for the first time, was obtained through biotransformation by T. viride and E. lata by means of an atypical acyloin-type reaction.The high yields observed for Eutypa and its ability to carry out an unreported acyloin-type reaction seem to indicate that this fungus could be a potential biocatalyst.

IR spectra were recorded on a Mattson Genesis spectrophotometer, series FTIR. 1 H and 13 C NMR measurements were obtained on Varian Gemini 300 and Varian Unity 400 NMR spectrometers with SiMe 4 as the internal reference. Mass spectra were recorded on a GC-MS Thermoquest spectrometer (model: Voyager) and a VG Autospec-Q spectrometer. HPLC was performed with a Hitachi/Merck L-6270 apparatus equipped with a UV-vis detector (L 6200) and a differential refractometer detector (RI-71). TLC was performed on Merck Kiesegel 60 F 254 , 0.2 mm thick. Silica gel (Merck) was used for column chromatography. Purification by means of HPLC was accomplished with a silica gel column (Hibar 60, 7 m, 1 cm wide, 25 cm long). Chemicals were products of Fluka or Aldrich. All solvents used were freshly distilled.
