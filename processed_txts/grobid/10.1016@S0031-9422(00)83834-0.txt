CECILIN, A l-BENZYL-P -CARBOLINE FROM ANIBA SANTALODORA *
The trunk wood of Aniba santdodora (Lauraceae) contains benzyl benzoate and a novel alkaloid, lp-hydroxybenzyl-6-methoxy-P_carboline.

INTRODUCIION
Wood of Aniba santalodoraDucke, 'louro umiri', a lauraceous tree from the Manaus region of Amazonas State, Brazil, upon solvent extraction yielded an oily constituent, identified as benzyl benzoate, and a crystalline substance called cecilin.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe structural proposal 1 for cecilin was based on its 'H NMR spectrum which shows an AA'BB' system at T 2.82 and 3.35 (shifted to T 2.56 and 2.96 in cecilin acetate) characteristic of a 4-hydroxyphenyl group, a singlet (7 5.67) for the benzylic protons, the typical H-3, H-4 doublets (T 1.78 and 2.04, J = 5 Hz) of the carboline unit, a singlet (~6.13) for the methoxyl, besides two doublets (7 2.22, J = 2.0 and 2.47, J = 8.5 Hz) and one double-doublet (T 2.79, J = 2.0 and 8.5 Hz) assigned respectively to H-5, H-8 and H-7. The only alternative assignment compatible with these multiplicities and coupling constants was ruled out by comparison of the chemical shifts with those of H-8 (T 2.66, J = 2.1 Hz), H-5 (T 1.88, J = 8.6 Hz) and H-6 (T 3.13, J = 2.1 and 8.6 Hz) for the model compound 2 (in the same DMSO-solvent[2]). The structural proposal for cecilin was confirmed by a two-step synthesis involving condensation of (*)-5methoxytryptophan with p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic The common alkaloids of this family, and the genus Aniba is no exception[12], are derived from phenylalanine [ 131.
Short ReportsCecilin (1) is of mixed biosynthetic origin, deriving from both these aromatic amino acids. A recent review on @-carboline alkaloids does not report a single representative of this type [14], such derivation is therefore a rare feature indeed for a natural product.  238, 248 sh, 299, 355, 380 sh (21 100, 15 950, 10 950, 3000, 3000). v",Z (cm--'): 3400, 3230, 1605, 1580, 1450, 1210, 810.

EXPERIMENTALSynfhesis of 1. (*)-5-Methoxytryptophan (0.5 g) and phydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (0.5 g) in a mixture of M HzSO, (2.5 ml), Hz0 (8 ml) and EtOH (5 ml) were heated under reflux (22 hr). After evapn of EtOH and addition of 18 M NH,OH (3 ml) and active charcoal, the mixture was boiled (30 min), cooled, diluted with NH,OH (l.Sml), filtered, washed with EtzO, coned and kept at 0" (24 hr). Successive crops of crystals, mp230-232", 210-220". 202-205". mix-tures of stereoisomers of 3, were combined (0.24 g) and used directly in the next step. To a boiling soln of 3 (0.21 g) in Hz0 (35 ml) were added 10% aq. KzCrzO, (7 ml) and HOAc (1.2 ml). After reflux (30 min) and cooling aq. NazSO, was added. The mixture was made alkaline with aq. NaHCO, and extracted with EtzO. The Et,0 soln was dried and evapd. The residue was crystallized from CHCIs-MeOH-hexane to 1 (30 mg), indistinguishable by mmp and spectra from the natural product.61 and of tryptamines with phenylpyruvic acid [7]. The aromatization procedure has been used previously for similar purposes [8,9]. * Part LX in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae". For Part LIX see ref.

Chod. et Hassl. [ 111, are very rare in Lauraceae.
The solvent was evapd and the residue (400 gj extracted with petrol in a Soxhlet apparatus.The solvent was evapd and the residue (2Og) chromatographed on Si gel. Elution with CHCl, and CHCIs-MeOH (19: 1) gave respectively benzyl benzoate and a product which, when recrystallized from EtOH, gave cecilin.Isolation of constituents.
