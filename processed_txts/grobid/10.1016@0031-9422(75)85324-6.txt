When treated with CH,N2, it yielded an oily methyl ester. the spectral data of which were in accordance with those reported for eperua-7.

The structure was elucidated through the methyl ester and the product of its reduction with LiAIH,. These compounds had physical data identical with those reported for the lab-l 3-en-8fiol-15-oic acid (enantio) derivatives [S].Labdan-8/?-ol-1%oic acid (enantio) was eluted from a silica column with hexane-Et,0 1 :I, and then treated with CH2NL. The product, crystallized from EtzO, had mp 82'. From H. salicijblia and related species, 20 alkaloids have been reported [2-61. All of them are cis or trans lactonic biphenyl or biphenylether quinolizidine derivatives. Their structure, stereochemistry and absolute configuration has been established [7]. Phenylalanine has been found to be a biosynthetic precursor of one of the major alkaloids of H. salicifolia [S]. The taxonomic status of the genus Heimia is not completely clear [9] and it appears that the type of alkaloids itJ?+ I= \' Me0 OH OMe (1)contains may vary with the place and date of recollection [7].Present work. From the ethanolic extracts a high yield of mannitol was obtained. TLC comparison with the known Heimia alkaloids (MeOH-Me&O 1: 1, chromogenic agent, Dragendorll) showed that the light petrol and EtOH extracts, contained sinicuichine, cryogenine and nesodine. The first two were isolated and compared with authentic specimens by, mmp, (c() and TLC. Two new alkaloids AX-1 and ALC-2 were isolated in this work; on the basis of their typical mass fragmentation [5], NMR [7,10] and properties of their methyl ether derivatives, they were shown to be stereomers of lythrine (1). They exhibited Bohlmann bands [l l] in the IR, so they must be nuns-quinolizidine derivatives.
EXPERIMENTAL
Dried and powderized aerial parts of H. salicifofolia (850 g)were Soxhlet extracted, first with light petrol and then with EtOH. From the light petrol extract (8.5 g) only sitosterol (O-1 g) was isolated, mmp, CO-TLC, IR, NMR, (a). On concentration of the EtOH extract, a yellowish solid (16.3 g) was collected, which on recrystallization afforded 12 g of l-mannitol, mp 165-166" mmp, (a)p -16.6", mmp, IR, NMR, hexacetate, mmp, (r) NMR, IR.

It is also used in a syrup recommended for the treatment of bronchitis and an infusion of the bark is used for stomach troubles. Ptwious work. On resin [I--7]. Prrsettr work. Burt%. A C,H, extract of dried and finely ground leaves subjected to various chromatographic separations yielded a series of resin acids, three of which are listed below; and sitosterol identified by mp and mmp.
