IntroductionCalophyllum brasiliense (Clusiaceae), popularly known as ''guanandi'', is used by the population of Mato Grosso State in Brazil to treat several illnesses, mainly chronic ulcers and inflammation. Previous studies carried out in our group and elsewhere have confirmed these pharmacological properties [1,2]. Chemical studies performed on the heartwood of C. brasiliense have led to the identification of several xanthones as well as the ubiquitous friedelin, sitosterol and stigmasterol [3,4]. The isolation of isoapetalic, petalic, and blancoic acids and isomers has been carried out from the seeds of this specie [5].Brasiliensic and isobrasiliensic acids have been isolated from a resin extracted from C. brasiliense stem bark [6,7]. Two xanthones, jacareubin and guanandin, isolated from C. brasiliense, have been shown to have antimicrobial activity [8]. It has also been demonstrated that friedelin has diuretic activity as well as anti-inflammatory and antidepressive activity on the central nervous system [9]. Intensive pharmacological studies were carried out with coumarins and xanthones isolated from the stem bark of C. brasiliense, some of which have shown potent cancer chemopreventing effects [10,11] as well as cell's growth inhibitors [12]. The chromanone acids have been also target to investigate the biological significance, presenting antibacterial activity [13].Although a full characterization of some chromanone acids have been given in the literature [13], in the present work we describe the structural determination of O-methoxy-methyl esters derivatives of the chromanones inophylloidic acid (1) and isobrasiliensic acid (2), as well as a mixture containing 2 and brasiliensic acid O-methoxy-methyl ester (3), respectively, and their precise attribution of 13 C and 1 H chemical shifts by two-dimensional NMR methods ( 1 H-COSY, HMQC, HMBC), in order to correct erroneous attributions observed in previous communications [7,14].
Experimental
General experimental proceduresNMR spectra were recorded at Universidade Federal de Sa˜o Carlos (UFSCar) on a Bruker model ARX 400 (400 MHz 1 H-; 100 MHz 13 C-NMR) spectrometer with inverse detection. Two-dimensional experiments, carried out on pure samples of compounds 1 and 2, were performed with standard Bruker software. The samples were dissolved in CDCl 3 (Aldrich) and the coupling constants (J ) are quoted in Hertz. IR spectra were obtained on a Bomen, model MB 100, FTIR spectrophotometer; the samples were prepared as thin films on NaCl plates. UV spectra were obtained, from dichloromethane solutions, utilizing a Hitachi, model U-2001 spectrophotometer. Column chromatography (CC) was carried out on Merck silica: 63-230 mm, normalphase; 40-63 mm, flash-chromatography and 63-200 mm silanized silica (dimethylsilane), reversed-phase. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck silica, code 60 GF 254 and code 60 PF 254 (silanized). Preparative TLC (PTLC) was performed on Aldrich silica gel (5-25 mm). HPLC was carried out at UFSCar, on a Shimadzu LC-6AD (recycling, loop ¼ 2 mL) and Shimadzu LC-8A, both equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-AV UV detector (254 nm) and silica columns Shim-Pack Prep-Sil(H), Shim-Pack Prep-ODS and ASAHIPack (GS-310P,21). The solvents were pumped at 5 mL min À1 . Optical rotations were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer model 241 polarimeter. Assays were carried out employing EBHEX and its chromatographic fractions obtained after silica gel filtration with hexane (fractions H x ), dichloromethane (fractions DCM x ), ethyl acetate (fractions Ac x ) and methanol (fractions M x ) at FCM/UFMT, according to literature procedures [1].
Plant materialCalophyllum brasiliense stem bark was collected near Santo Antoˆnio of Leverger Road, outskirts of Cuiaba´city, Mato Grosso State, in July 1996. Taxonomic ratification was carried out at UFMT by Dr Germano Guarim Neto. A voucher sample has been deposited at UFMT Central Herbarium, receiving the number 3767.
Extraction and isolationHexane (54 L) was added to finely powdered stem bark of C. brasiliense (18 kg), and the mixture allowed macerating for 7 days (r.t.) before filtration and solvent removal under vacuum (40 C). EBHEX was obtained after drying the residue in an oven (40 C) as far as no more loss of weight was observed (686.69 g; 3.81%). EBHEX (200 g) was adsorbed on silica (400 g), and the mixture was filtered through a silica column (600 g), with 2 L of each hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol. Approximately 500 mL solvent aliquots were collected or, in case colored bands could be seen, elution was carried out to collect the whole band. The following fractions were obtained after the solvents were removed under vacuum (40 C) and the residue fully dried in an oven (40 C): hexane -H 1 (3.17 g; 1.6%), H 2 1.96 g; 0.98%); dichloromethane -DCM 1 (5.73 g; 2.87%), DCM 2 (72.3 g; 36.15%), and DCM 3 (29.93 g; 14.97%); ethyl acetate -Ac 1 (5.92 g; 2.96%), Ac 2 (73.32 g; 36.66%), Ac 3 (0.82 g; 0.41%), and methanol -M 1 (1.25 g; 0.63%) and M 2 (0.4 g; 0.2%).Fraction DCM 2 (3.27 g) was submitted to reversed-phase chromatography on silanized silica (27 g), in methanol-water (3 : 1). Fifty-seven 10 mL fractions were collected and after TLC analysis, were grouped in 14 fractions. Fraction number nine (DCM 2-9 ) was treated with diazomethane (excess), and the resulting mixture submitted to a new silica gel chromatography in hexane-dichloromethane-ethyl acetate (8 : 1 : 1). Fifty nine fractions (10 mL) were pooled in 13 fractions after TLC analysis: DCM 2-9-1 to DCM 2-9-13 . Fraction DCM 2-9-3 was further purified by preparative TLC (hexane-acetone, 95 : 5), affording three fractions: DCM 2-9-3-1 to DCM 2933 . Fraction DCM 294 was chromatographed on silica gel column (hexaneacetone, 95 : 5), affording 24 fractions (10 mL), resulting on four fractions after TLC analysis: DCM 2-9-4-1 -DCM 2-9-4-4 . Fraction DCM 2-9-5 was chromatographed on silica gel column (hexane-acetone, 95 : 5), affording 38 fractions (10 mL), resulting in seven fractions after TLC analysis: DCM 2-9-5-1 to DCM 2-9-5-7 . Fractions DCM 2-9-3-2 , DCM 2-9-4-2 and DCM 2-9-5-2 presented the same R f and, therefore, were joined to a single fraction. This fraction was submitted to preparative HPLC in hexane-acetone (95 : 5). After ten 35 min cycles, two peaks could be observed. The first one afforded 1, the front part of the second one afforded 2 and the tail of the second peak afforded a mixture containing 2 and 3. 
Results and discussionChromatographic fractionation of DCM 2 fraction from the dichloromethane extract of C. brasiliense stem bark afforded nine fractions (DCM 2-1 to DCM 2-9 ). Diazomethane esterification of fraction DCM 2-9 followed by exhaustive column chromatography on silica gel led to the isolation and identification of three chromanone acid O-methoxy-methyl esters derivatives 1, 2, and 3, as discussed below Inophylloidic, brasiliensic and isobrasiliensic acids were first isolated in 1968 [6] and the results re-examined and corrected in 1970 [7]. Although the structures were brilliantly deduced by chemical and spectroscopic means, 1 H NMR data was precarious and 13 C NMR data were not described at that time. Later, Ravelonjato and co-workers [14] compared those results with the ones they had obtained at 500 MHz for the homologous O-methoxy-methyl esters of caloverticillic acid A (4) (or its epimer, caloverticillic acid B). However, the positions of many 13 C chemical shifts were not ascribed and some were wrongly attributed.O CO 2 Me R O O OMe R 1 (a) (b) (c)Two-dimensional NMR experiments reported in this article allowed a precise attribution of 13 C and 1 H NMR signals for O-methoxy-methyl esters derivatives 1, 2, and 3. Table 1 shows the high similarity of the 13 C chemical shifts attributed to compounds 1, 2, and 3. The differences are related to the presence or not of a cyclobutane ring and double bond position at C-7 side chain (a), (b), and (c). HMBC experiments carried out in compounds 1 and 2 (figure 1) allowed the unequivocal attribution of the chemical shifts of carbonylic C-4 and C-8 carbons, inversely attributed in the literature [14].Figure 2 shows the HMBC correlation that lead to the chemical shifts values of C-5, C-6, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14, C-19, C-24, C-25, and C-27, not described to the homologous structure 4 in the literature [14]. Table 2 shows 400 MHz 1 H NMR Unequivocal NMR assignments data of compounds 1 and 2, along with the 500 MHz NMR data obtained for the homologous compound 4 [14]. HMBC long range coupling (J 3 ) allowed easy identification of C-22, C-23, C-30, C-32, and C-33 methyl groups. The coupling constant values [J 2,3 ¼ 9.6 Hz in compound 2 and 9.3 Hz in 1] points to a trans relationship between the chromanone ring methyl groups (C-17 and C-18), a common feature within the Clusiaceae family [15]. Additionally, the small coupling constant value (J 24,25 ¼ 2.5 Hz) for the diastereotopic proton H-24 (1.96 ppm), in compound 1, suggests that C-25 is part of a rigid structure. The differences between the side chains in compounds 1 and 2, are evidenced by the presence of an absorption at 4.90 ppm, due to the H-27 vinylic hydrogen in 2, and another at 2.36 ppm, due to the H-27 methinic hydrogen in 1. Furthermore, the allylic methyl group, at position 29, in compound 2 absorbs at 1.55 ppm while the absorptions at 4.77 and 4.51 ppm can be attributed to the H-29 terminal vinylic hydrogens in (1). In the same way, vinylic   Unequivocal NMR assignments 851  allowed the full attribution of 13 C NMR chemical shifts, as well as their unequivocal assignments, complementing and correcting previous literature data [14].O-methyl inophylloidic acid methyl ester: R = H; R 1 = a.
