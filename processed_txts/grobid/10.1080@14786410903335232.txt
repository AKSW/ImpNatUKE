IntroductionPhenolic acids are natural products which possess a wide spectrum of biological activity (Nazaruk, Czechowska, Markiewicz, & Borawska, 2008).Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid), a secondary metabolite accumulates in nearly all plants, either in free form or part of tannins, is known to possess antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytotoxic properties (Aruoma, Murcia, Butler, & Halliwell, 1993;Fiuza et al., 2004;Kratz et al., 2008;Kroes, van den Berg, van Ufford, van Dijk, & Labadie, 1992;Kubo, Fujita, K. Nihei & A. Nihei, 2004). It is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as salts and esters. Some ointments used to treat psoriasis and external hemorrhoids contain gallic acid (Garcı´a de Hombre & Pe´rez Pen˜ate, 2006;Hatton, 2000). Gallic acid has two major functional groups, hydroxyls and a carboxylic acid, which can yield numerous esters and salt derivatives. Some galloyl compounds are used as antioxidants in food and can exhibit important roles in prevention of inflammatory and atherosclerosis responses by blocking activation of NFB (Murase et al., 1999).NFB consists of homo and heterodimeric protein complexes acting as a transcription factor, and is found in many animal cell types. It is involved in regulation of immune response and inflammation, cell lineage development, cell apoptosis, cell-cycle progression and oncogenesis due to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidised LDL and microbial antigens, and has been shown to regulate the expression of several genes, including bcl-2, bcl-xl, cIAP, survivin, TRAF, COX-2, MMP-9, iNOS and cell cycle-regulatory components, whose products are involved in tumourigenesis (Aggarwal, Sethi, Nair, & Ichikawa, 2006;Chen, Castranova, & Shi, 2001;Melisi & Chiao, 2007;Thanos & Maniatis, 1995). Most carcinogens, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1, or tumour promoters, including cigarette smoke, phorbol esters, okadaic acid, H 2 O 2 , have been shown to activate NFB, and resulting tumours have misregulated NFB activity (Baldwin, 2001). It is now well established that aberrant regulation of NFB, and the signalling pathways that control its activity, are involved in cancer development and progression, as well as in drug resistance, especially during chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Inoue, Gohda, Akiyama, & Semba, 2007). Blocking NFB can cause tumour cells to stop proliferating, undergo apoptosis, or to become more sensitive to the action of antitumour agents (Frydrych & Mlejnek, 2008;Yamamoto & Gaynor, 2001). Thus, agents that can suppress NFB activation have the potential to suppress carcinogenesis or tumourigenesis.In the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from Alchornea glandulosa Poepp and Endl. (Euphorbiaceae), and eight semi-synthetic esters were prepared. All the compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity as well as potential to inhibit TNF--induced NFB activation with stably transfected 293/NFB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells.

Column chromatography was carried out over silica gel (0.06-0.20 mm, Acros Organics). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). Preparative HPLC was carried out using a Varian Prep-Star 400 system and a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm Â 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz ( 1 H) and 125 MHz ( 13 C), using CDCl 3 and DMSO-d 6 as solvent (Aldrich). Alkyl alcohols and DCC were purchased from Aldrich. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and sulphorhodamine B (SRB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), antibiotic-antimycotic, hygromycin B, and MEM sodium pyruvate were purchased from Invitrogen Co. (Carlsbad, CA). Reporter Lysis Buffer, Luciferase Assay System was purchased from Promega (Madison). Tumour Necrosis Factor-(TNF-) was purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ). Alcohol was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ).
Isolation of gallic acidThe leaves of A. glandulosa were collected in the Biological Reserve and Experimental Station at Mogi Guac¸u, Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil, in March 2005. A voucher specimen (SP319257) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sa˜o Paulo-SP, Brazil).The shade-dried plant material (1.5 kg) was ground and defatted with n-hexane (3.5 L Â 3) at room temperature and exhaustively extracted by maceration with MeOH (4.2 L Â 3). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 3.8 g of a syrup residue, which was diluted with MeOH : H 2 O (4 : 1) and then successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After evaporation under reduced pressure, the partition phases yielded 2.5 g and 0.8 g, respectively. The part of EtOAc residue (2.0 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford 11 fractions (A1-A11). Fraction A2 (730 mg) was purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H 2 O : HOAc (7.5 : 92 : 0.5), UV detection at 265 nm; flow rate 15 mL min À1 ] to give compound 1 (335 mg). Compound 1 was identified as gallic acid based on analysis of the 1 H and 13 C NMR data, as well as by comparison with authentic material in our laboratory (Figure 1).  After being cooled at 5 C, the mixture of gallic acid (0.2 mmol) and alcohol (20 mmol) in p-dioxane (6.0 mL) was added to a solution of N,N 0 -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 1.0 mmol) in p-dioxane (3.0 mL). The solution was stirred for 48 h, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned three times with EtOAc and then filtered. The filtrate was washed successively with saturated aqueous citric acid solution (three times), saturated aqueous NaHCO 3 (three times), water (two times), dried over MgSO 4 , and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified over a silica gel column using an isocratic system of CHCl 3 -MeOH (98 : 2) to give gallate esters 2-8. Structures of the semisynthetic esters, methyl gallate (2), ethyl gallate (3), n-propyl gallate ( 4), isopropyl gallate (5), n-butyl gallate (6), isobutyl gallate (7), n-pentyl gallate (8) and 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid (9), were established by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral analysis (Figure 1). For synthesis of ester 9, gallic acid (20 mmol) was dissolved in dry pyridine (5.0 mL) and anhydride acetic (5.0 mL) under hydrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature, carried to dryness under reduced pressure, and purified by column chromatography with a mixture of CHCl 3 -MeOH (85 : 15) to give a product (9). The NMR spectroscopic data of 9 were compatible with 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid.
NFjB luciferase assayNFB inhibition assay was conducted using a luciferase reporter gene bioassay as previously described (Homhual et al., 2006). Human embryonic kidney cells (293/ NFB-Luc) were used to monitor alteration of the NFB pathway. This cell line is stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct regulated by the NFB response element. Transcription factor can bind to the response element when stimulated by TNF-, allowing transcription of the luciferase gene. Luciferase reacts with substrate, emitting light that was detected using a luminometer. Cells were seeded (10 5 cells mL À1 ) on sterile white walled 96-well plates and grown to approximately 80% confluence by incubating for 48 h. Gallic acid and alkyl gallates were tested at 20 mg mL À1 following 1 : 3 serial dilutions. After treatment with tested compounds for 10 min, cells were incubated for an additional 6 h with or without TNF-(5 ng mL À1 ). The cells were gently washed with PBS and kept at À80 C with luciferase lysis buffer (Promega Corporation). The luciferase assay was performed using the Luc assay system from Promega following manufacturer instructions. Luciferase activity was monitored (LUMIstar Galaxy BMG), dose-response curves were constructed, and results were expressed as IC 50 values (i.e. concentration required to inhibit TNF-induced NFB activity by 50%).
Cytotoxicity assayCytotoxicity was determined by the method of Skehan et al. (1990). The cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid and stained for 30 min with 0.4% (w/v) sulphorhodamine B (SRB) prepared in 1% acetic acid. Unbound dye was removed by washing with 1% acetic acid, and protein-bound dye was extracted with 10 mM Tris base [tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane] for determination of optical density in a computer-interfaced, 96-well microtiter plate reader.
Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Õ Version 5.01 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Results were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and differences between means were located using Tukey's multiple comparison test. Differences between means at the 5% ( p 5 0.05) level were considered significant. The data are expressed as means AE standard error.
Results and discussionHerein we report cytotoxic properties and suppression of TNF-induced NFB activation of gallic acid (1) and eight esters (2-9) determined with stably transfected 293/NFB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Table 1 shows the concentrations of gallates 1-9 required to inhibit NFB-induced activation in 50% (IC 50 ). N-Tosyl-L-phenylalaninyl-chlormethylketone (TPCK) was adopted as positive control, exhibiting 98.5% AE 0.5% NFB inhibition at 30 mM, with an IC 50 value of about 5 mM. At the highest concentration tested (20.0 mg mL À1 ), gallic acid mediated a moderate cytotoxic effect (52.9% AE 3.5% survival), but none of the gallate esters significantly affected cell viability. The most cytotoxic compound evaluated was 6, with 48.9% AE 3.3% cell survival.Among inhibitors of NFB, salicylates, aspirin (Kopp & Ghosh, 1994), apigenin and curcumin (Gerritsen et al., 1995;Singh & Aggarwal, 1996) were reported to suppress activation of NFB by preventing the degradation of the NFB inhibitor (IB), and therefore NFB was retained in the cytosol.The serine protease inhibitor TPCK can cause a complete block to NFB activation. TPCK inhibits NFB subunits processing and IB degradation (Mellitis, Hay, & Goodbourn, 1993). It has also been demonstrated that TPCK inhibits DNA replication by G 0 -G 1 growth arrest and thus promotes apoptosis by other cytotoxic stimuli (Kirillova, Chaisson, & Fausto, 1999). The present study provides evidence that some gallates can act as inhibitors of NFB. Methyl gallate (2) demonstrated the greatest activity. The inhibitory actions of gallates do not appear to result from non-specific cellular toxicity but rather are specific for NFB-dependent gene transcription. In another study, it has been demonstrated that gallates can inhibit TNF--induced nuclear translocation of NFB by way of a mechanism independent of IB degradation (Murase et al., 1999).More recently, prevention of atherosclerosis, cancer, anti-plasmodial and antioxidant activity of a group of galloyl compounds was described, as well as structure-activity relationships yielding cytotoxic properties (Fiuza et al., 2004;Jagan, Ramakrishnan, Anandakumar, Kamaraj, & Devaki, 2008;Locatelli et al., 2008;Murase et al., 1999;Na et al., 2006;Petroˆnio et al., 2007;Saxena et al., 2008). Based on these encouraging intracellular responses, we suggest suppression of NFB activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis, and further investigations related to the actions of gallates, especially in NFB signaling pathway and in vivo models, may provide new insights into the cancer chemopreventive ability.Figure 1 .1Figure 1.
