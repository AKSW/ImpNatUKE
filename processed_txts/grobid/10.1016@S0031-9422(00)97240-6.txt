XANTHONES FROM KIELMEYERA
Kielmeyera rubriflora Camb. contains 2_hydroxyxanthone, 2,4-dimethoxy-3-hydroxyxanthone , 2,3-dimethoxy-4_hydroxyxanthone, 4-hydroxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone, 4-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone and 1,7-dimethoxy-2,3,&trihydroxyxanthone (Ia).WOOD and bark of the tree Kielmeyera rubrijlora Camb. (Guttiferae) were collected in the SCrro region, Minas Gerals State, Brasil. The benzene extract of the wood yielded 2hydroxyxanthone,'*2 2,4-dimethoxy-3-hydroxyxanthone,2 2,3-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyxanthone,2-s 4-hydroxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone, 2,3 4-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone,3*s kie1corin4 and /3-sitosterol. All the xanthones had been isolated previously from other Kielmeyera species and were identified by direct comparison with authentic samples.The benzene extract of the bark yielded, besides aliphatic material, a new compound. Its molecular weight, determined by mass spectrometry, was consistent with the constitution of a dimethoxytrihydroxyxanthone.The PMR-spectrum confirmed the existence of two methoxyls and of three aromatic protons. One proton was represented by a singlet at 3.55~ and must, consequently, be placed at the 2-, 3-or 4-position of a trioxygenated ring. The remaining two protons were represented by doublets at 2.67 7 (.I 9-O Hz) and 3.43 7 (9-O Hz) and must, consequently, be placed at the 5,6 or 6,7-positions of the dioxygenated ring. All signals were sufficiently up-field to preclude the existence of a proton at a peri (1,8)-position of either ring.6One of these peri-positions is occupied by a hydroxyl, as shown by the shift of the UV absorption maxima upon addition of AlCl, + HCl. The second peri-position, however, is occupied by a methoxyl, since the compound reacted speedily with diazomethane to form a monohydroxy-tetramethoxyxanthone (and not a dihydroxy-trimethoxyxanthone). The mass spectrum of this derivative contained a peak corresponding to M-l 5-l 8 a.m.u. Loss of the elements of water upon electron impact again suggested the presence of a methoxy-group adjacent to the carbonyl.7 * Part XXVII in the series "The Chemistry of Brazdian Guttiferae".

The di-O-methyl derivative gave a Gibbs test maximum at 667 nm, typical of a system featuring an unsubstituted position, para related to a peri-hydroxyL8The Gibbs test,* when performed on the original compound, as well as the shift of UV maxima upon addition of H,BO, + NaOAc, indicated the presence of an ortho-dlhydroxy grouping.Clearly, these hydroxyls cannot be situated at positions adjoinmg the peri-hydroxyl.Three vicinal hydroxy groups are incompatible with the relatively high stabihty of the compound in presence of alkali. They have, consequently, to be placed either at C-2,C-3 adjoinmg the peri-methoxyl, or at C-3,C-4. The latter alternative, however, cannot be correct, smce It also would impart instablhty to a xanthone in alkaline medium.8 Thus, the peri-hydroxyl with the unsubstituted para-posltion is located in the dlsubstituted ring. In view of the vicinity of the hydrogens on this ring, the remaming methoxyl and the peri-hydroxyl must be o&o-related.This leads to the constitution of 1,7-dimethoxy-2.3,8-trihydroxyxanthone (Ia) for the new compound.The 1,2,3,7,%pentaoxygenation pattern has not been reported previously for a natural xanthone. The powdered bark (7.0 kg) was continuously extracted with hot benzene. The filtered benzene solution was evaporated and the residue (35 g) was extracted exhaustively with light petroleum. The insoluble portion (8 g) was chromatographed on slhca, yleldmg only aliphatic material which was not further examined. The light petroleum solution was filtered through sdica and extracted with aqueous Na,CO,. The alkaline solution was acidified and extracted with CHC13. The CHCI, was evaporated and the residue was crystallized from MeOH, giving Ia (24 mg).  EXPERIMENTALFor experimental techniques see Ref. 5. The identification of all previously described substances was confirmed by direct comparison (co-chromatography, mixed m.ps and IR spectra) with authentic samples.Isolation of the constituents of Lielmeyera rubriflora. The powdered wood (7.0 kg) was continuously extracted with hot benzene. The filtered benzene solution was evaporated and the residue (18 g) was chromatographed on slhca. Elution with CHC13 yielded, in order, 4-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone, fi-sitosterol, 4-hydroxy-2,3-dimethoxyxanthone (20 mg), 3-hydroxy-2,3-dlmethoxyxanthone (20 mg), 4-hydroxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone (10 mg), 2-hydroxyxanthone (30 mg) and kielcorm (40 mg).IO R=H b R=Me
