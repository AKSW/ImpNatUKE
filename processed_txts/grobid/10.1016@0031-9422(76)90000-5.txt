NEOLIGNANS FROM A LICARIA SPECIES*
The hevood of a Licaria species (Quraceae) contains two neolignans, eusiderin, re1-(2R,3R)-l-allyl-5methoxy-2~3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methylbenzodioxan, and aurein, 244-allyloxy-3,5-methoxypheny1)-1-(3,4,5-tri-methoxypheny1)-propane. \ > The classification of a Licarh species [4], trivial name "louro figa\do de galinha", from the vicinity of Manaus, Amazonas, will be possible upon completion of the revision of Lauraceae by Dr. K. Kubitzki, Hamburg. Its trunk wood contains two neolignans: eusiderin, which was located previously in the Indonesian Lauraceae species Elcideroxylotr mageri T. et B.[2], and a compound which was designated aurein in a plant thought to be Licaria alrrea (Huber) Kosterm. [3].

.Structural proposals for eusiderin, ClsH,,O2(0Me),, based mainly on the recognition that no phenolic degradation products were observed othcr than pyrogallol derivatives, included not only the benzodioxan alternatives l a and lb, but also isomeric formulations such as 2 121.Re-examination of this problem, by modern spectrometric techniques, invalidated any but the benzodioxan structures, indicated the correct alternative and suggested the trans-relationship between the aryl and methyl substituents.Indeed, the most abundant MS fragment ion revealed the existence of the system (Me0)3C,H2CHCHMe which, according to PMR evidence,jncludes two equivalent aromatic protons (~3.40, s) and two vicinal aliphatic oxymethines; one linked to phenyl (~5.46, d, 58.0 Hz) and the other to methyl (55. 7-6.3, m). The two oxygens must participate in the additional pyrogallol moiety, which, furthermore, supports the fourth methoxyl and a n ally1 group (n-propyl inthe dihydroderivative), flanked by two t~leta-related aromatic protons (~3.63 and 3.51).The Pr(fod), induced diamagnetic shift of the doublet at ~3 . 6 3 (A2.4 ppm) is larger than that of the doublet at ~3.51 (A2.0 ppm), and the former signal must thus be assigned to the proton in ortho relation with respect to the oxy-methoxy coordination site.

While the 52 value is typical for an ortho-proton in 1,2-dimethoxybenzenes, the 44 value is about twice as strong as would b e expected for a para-proton [4]. This indicates the vicinity of the para-proton to a n additional coordination site identified with the orrho-trimethoxy function of the aryl group, since the benzodioxane oxygens associate only feebly with the reagent [4]. Formula la, and not lb, thus emerges as the correct Rl ... trum of this phenol and of its hexaacetate ( 3 4 are devoid of s i p a l s due to an J l -~r o ~~l group, and, hence, the ally1 group of aurein must etherify the undefined oxygen of its formula given above. Indeed, pyrolysis (to 3e 56% yield) and acid treatment (to 3g 76% yield) of aurein easily cleave this 0-allyl. The former reaction is relevant, since loss of the ally1 group shoivs that the 0-and ppositions Felative to the O-allyl group are substituted. In the latter reaction, comparison of t h e P M R spectrum shows that the O-allyl group (OCH2-r5'53) of is replaced in the rearrangement product ( 3 d by a C-all~l group (CCH?, z6.75) which genemtes a C-1l-pr0pyl group (CCH,, r8.44) after hydrogenation (3). In 3% one of the two pairs of equivalent aromatic protons (r3.68, s) in aurein is reduced to one lone proton (r3.56, s), while on this postulate was achieved [7], while 4 and 6 would give an intermediate which, upon hydrogen addition and retr0-Claisen rearrangement, would lead to aurein (3a). This singular process recalls the biosynthesis of thyroxin [8] where, however, the final dienone-phenol re. arrangement causes the loss of a three-carbon fragment. The retro-Claisen reaction was postulated previously to rationalize the biosynthesis of another neolignan type [9,10] (cm-I): 1335, 1240, 1130.
