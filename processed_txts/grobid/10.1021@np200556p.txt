Correction to Azaphilones from the Endophyte Chaetomium globosum [
There are two related compounds named as chaetoviridin E, 9,23 and our data for 5 are in agreement with the first published structure. 9 The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused by these errors. DOI: 10.1021/np200556pPage 1183: In the structure elucidation description for 2 and 4, "On the other hand, the relative configuration of the C 8 and C 2 0 positions of the chaetoviridins B (2) and D (4) was suggested to be cis by Takahashi et al. 8 on the basis of the magnitude of the coupling constants (10.2 Hz in 2 and 9.7 Hz in 4). A qualitative analysis of the NOE experiments confirmed this disposition. In particular, NOE interactions were detected between H-7CH 3 , H-8 and H-2 0 , supporting the S-configuration for C 8 and C 2 0." should be corrected to "The relative configuration of the C 8 and C 2 0 positions of the chaetoviridins B (2) and D (4) was suggested to be cis by Takahashi et al. 8 on the basis of the magnitude of the coupling constants (10.2 Hz in 2 and 9.7 Hz in 4). More recently, structures of chaetoviridins B and D have been revised by Kingsland and Barrow 23 that proposed an additional lactone ring in the structures. All the 1 H and 13 C NMR data for both proposals are coincident. Our HRESIMS data for compounds 2 and 4 confirmed the cyclization of the hydroxyl group at C 5 0 with the carboxylic acid at C 1' in the first structures proposed by Takahashi et al. 8 Therefore, structures of compounds 2 and 4 are in agreement with those proposed by Kingsland and Barrow. 23 " Page 1183: The sentence "The absolute configuration of C5 0 could not be determined by this method as it was not possible to derivatize the secondary alcohol linked to this carbon." should be removed.
