NEOLIGNANS FROM AN ANIBA SPECIES*
INTRODUCTIONThe trunk wood of an Aniba (Lauraceae) species collected 130 km north of Manaus (Amazonas) contained, besides elemicin (3,4,5-trimethoxyallylbenzene), three burchellin-type neolignans (la, lb, 2) previously isolated from A. terminalis [2,3] and five novel neolignans, four of the canellin type (3a, 3b, 3f, 4b) and one of the guianin type (4a). For reasons stated in the previous paper in this series [1], nomenclature and numbering of neolignans follow the rules which were outlined in a recent review [4]. OH(OMe)2OzCH2, from A. simulans [5]. Constitutional differences concern the nature of the aryl groups with piperonyl (Pi) in 3a, 3b and 3c but 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyphenyl (Mp) in 3e and 3f. Configurational differences concern orientation of H-4' further from the plane of the carbonyl in 3a, 3b and 3e (6 4.15±0.03, J=3Hz) than in 3e and 3f (6 4.45± 0.11, J=5 Hz). This difference in orientation, which was left undefined in the original report on 3e and 31 [5] was confirmed by antipodal Cotton effects at the carbonyl absorptions (ca 330 nm) for 3a, 3b and 3e compared with 3¢, 3f. The Cotton effects for the benzenoid absorptions (ca 255 nm), however, are identical for all five compounds, and absolute stereochemical details known for 3e and 3f [5] can thus be extended to 3a, 3b and 3¢. Deduction of these details had involved conversion of 3e, as well as le of known absolute sterochemistry, into the guianin-type neolignan 4e [5]. ~I-t NMR analysis indicated the relationship of the novel 4a, C18H15Oz'OH(OMe)2, and of 4e, C~8H1402 (OMe)202CH2. Except for the aryl groups, Pi in 4a and Mp in 4c, the compounds are identical in all respects, including stereochemistry, as shown by superimposable ORD curves. In contrast, the neolignan 5 from A. affinis [6], an isomer of 4a, shows an antipodal Cotton effect at the absorption wavelength (ca 270 nm) of the enone chromophore.

5Like 4a (v .... I764, 1680cm-~), 4b is also a diketone. One of the carbonyls is again on a cyclopentane ring (U,,ax 1760 cm -~) but the other is not a, /3unsaturated (u,,,x 1695 cm-~). Indeed, the compound, C~sH17Oz-OH(OMe)z, has two additional hydrogens in its formula and is thus tentatively written 4b. The 60 MHz IH NMR spectrum, although consistent, is not sufficiently resolved between 6 2.0-3.0 and 4.3-4.7 to confirm this proposal.
EXPERIMENTALIsolation of the constituents. Trunk wood of an Aniba species (voucher Herbarium INPA, Manaus, 43254), collected near km 133 of the Manaus-Itacoatiara highway (Amazonas) was reduced to powder (4.5 kg) and percolated with EtOH. The solvent was evapd and the residue (65 g) extracted with C6H 6. The extract (5 g) was chromatographed on a dry Si gel (280 g) column. Development with C6H 6-EtOAc (8:2) gave 6 fractions. Fraction 1 (0.9 g) was a fatty oil. Fraction 2 (0.7 g) gave elemicin, Fraction 3 (0.9 g) was separated with MeOH into an insoluble steroid and a soluble mixture. This was separated by TLC (Si gel; petrol-Me2CO, 8:2) into la and 3c. Fractions 4 (0.3 g) and 5 (0.3 g) were separated by the same TLC procedure respectively into 43 + 4b, 311, 2 and lb, 3b. All products were purified by TLC (Si gel; C6H6-Et20, 7:3) giving la (8 rag), lb (159 mg), 2 (20 mg), 33 (49 rag), 3b (13 mg), 3e (12 rag, 43 (8 rag), 4b (5 mg).Identifications of the known compounds elemicin, la, lb and 2 involved direct comparison with authentic samples [2, 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Six known phenylpropanoids:p-methoxycinnamic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, caffeic acid methyl ester, p-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, caffeic acid and two triterpenes: @-amyrin acetate and lupeol were isolated from the ether-soluble fraction of the methanol extract of the whole plant of B. tobirucola Makino. Dihydrochalcone 1 was also isolated from the same fraction, while from the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the methanol extract, both 1 and the related glucoside 2 were obtained. From measurements of IR, MS, 'H and "C NMR spectra of 1 and the corresponding tri-. tetra-and pentamethyl ethers prepared by methylation with diazomethane or dimethyl sulphate, the structure of 1 was assumed to be 3-hydroxyphloretin.This was confirmed by the direct comparisons (IR. MS and 'H. NMR) with an authentic sample. On acid hydrolysis. 2 yielded 3-hydroxyphloretin.and fi-[,-glucose. Futhermore, the presence of a @-glucopyranose moiety in 2 was shown by the analysis of the coupling constants of the anomeric carbon atoms (C-1") in the ' 'CJ NMR sprectra (Table 1,l [7] of 2 and its hepta-and octaacetates. Consequently. i.e. rrans-cinnamic acid and caffeic acid methyl ester were present in both parts of the plant, the main components ot the flowers were glycosides (80%). while the rhizomes contained 60% of hydrocarbons and triterpenes such as P-amyrin acetate and lupeol, along with 30"/0 of phcnylpropanoids. 1H NMR analysis showed 3a, C18H180(OH)202-CH2, 3b, CIsHlsO'OH'OMe'O2CH2, and 3e, *Part 55 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae".

one of seven Balanophoraceous plants in Japan, parasitizes the terminal roots of host plant such as Pittosporum tobira Ait. and is distributed from southern Japan to Taiwan [l]. Several triterpenes and phenylpropanoids have been reported previously from B. japonica Makino [2], B. polyandra Griff. [3] and B. indica Wall. [4] and several flavones from Lophophytum Learn&i Eirchl. 151 and Juelia subterranea [6]. This paper describes the phytochemistry of B. tobiracolu Makino.
2 is 3-hydroxyphlorctin 4'-P-Dglucoside. and this was confirmed by comparison with an authentic sample. Although 3-hydroxyphoretin and its glucoside have already been isolated from the leaves of Malus sieboldi~ Rehd. var. arborescens (Rosaceae) [s]. this is the first report of a dihydrochalcone and its glucoside in Balanophoraceous plants. Comparative studies of the constituents of the Rowers and the rhizomes of B. tobirucolu Makino, showed clear differences:
