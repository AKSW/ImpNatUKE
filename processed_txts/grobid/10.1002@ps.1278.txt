Bioactivity of extracts and isolated compounds from Vitex polygama (Verbenaceae) and Siphoneugena densiflora (Myrtaceae) against Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) †
The effects of crude extracts, fractions and isolated compounds from Vitex polygama Cham. and Siphoneugena densiflora Berg were evaluated on the development of Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith, a destructive insect pest of corn and several other crops. The extracts and fractions were incorporated into an artificial diet at 1 mg g -1 and offered to the insect during its larval stage. Length and viability of larval and pupal stages as well as pupal weight were assessed. Isolated compounds were tested through superficial contamination of the diet at 0.1 mg g -1 . Weight and viability of ten-day-old larvae were determined. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic S. densiflora extracts caused 100% larval mortality, while leaf and fruit hydroalcoholic extracts from V. polygama were the most active. Among the isolated compounds, flavonoids presented the best insecticidal results, and tannins the best larval growth inhibition.

INTRODUCTIONWith a projected increase in world population to 10 billion over the next four decades, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve maximum production of food and other products in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and cost effective. 1 One major limiting factor to global food production is damage by pests, during both growth and storage stages. The use of synthetic pesticides has been an effective way to control pests, but their efficacy is constantly weakened by development of resistance in economically important pests. 2 Increasing interest in the application of plant secondary metabolites in insect pest management, as an alternative to the use of synthetic insecticides, has led to the search for active plant compounds, less poisonous to the environment and with low mammalian toxicity. 3 Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), the model insect pest selected, has a record of injuring over 80 plants, among them important field crops such as corn, cotton, soybean and wheat.Larvae destroy the plant growth potential by consuming foliage and burrowing into its growing points. The control of the damage requires high volumes of insecticide, resulting in resistance to several kinds of insecticidal compound. 4 Of the two Brazilian plant species chosen to be bioassayed and phytochemically investigated, Vitex polygama Cham. (Verbenaceae) had already been studied, and many of its compounds characterized, but none was considered as a potential insecticide. 5 -9 This plant is commonly called 'Maria-Preta', 'Tarumã', 'Congonha-cinco-folhas' and the like. 10,11 Its leaf tea has been used in folk medicine to treat kidney diseases. 11 The other plant, Siphoneugena densiflora Berg (Myrtaceae), belongs to a genus comprising only eight species, with two of them vulnerable to extinction in São Paulo State. 12,13 Popularly named 'Uvatinga', 13 it has been pointed out as a source of energy generation in a recent investigation, 14 and herbarium observations by the present authors indicate that this species shows strong resistance to insect attack.Even though the selected plant species have not been ordinarily employed in pest control, their families comprise several species with injurious properties to insects reported in the literature. 15 -21 The present paper specifically deals with the effects of crude extracts, fractions and isolated compounds from V. polygama and S. densiflora against fall armyworm (S. frugiperda). Aspects examined include insecticidal and growth regulatory activities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 GeneralHeteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bonding correlation (HMBC, J 8.0 Hz) experiments as well as 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (deuteropyridine, acetone-d 6 or deuteromethanol) from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), or Merck-Schuchardt (8011 Hohenbrunn bei M ünchen), using TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal reference. The equipment employed was either a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany; 1 H, 400 MHz; 13 C, 100 MHz) or a Bruker ARX-200 spectrometer ( 1 H, 200 MHz; 13 C, 50 MHz). Lowresolution electrospray mass spectroscopy (ESI/MS) was carried out on a Micromass Quattro LC triplequadrupole instrument (Manchester, UK). IR spectra were measured on a Bomem MB-102 spectrophotometer (Quebec, Canada) in potassium bromide pellets. UV spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 Scan/UV-Vis-Nir spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Australia). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-10AD pump (Kyoto, Japan), an SPD-10A UV-Vis detector and a CBM-10A interface, using a Shodex Asahipack GS-310 preparative column (50.0 × 2.5 cm ID). Data acquisition was performed on CLASS LC10 software.Column chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (70-230 or 230-400 mesh; Merck KGaA, 64 271, Darmstadt, Germany), Sephadex  LH-20 (25-100 µm; Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, Uppsala, Sweden) or XAD7  (Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). Spots were visualized under 254 nm UV light and by spraying with either vanillin sulfuric acid solution followed by heating or FeCl 3 acid solution. Methanol (JT Baker, Philipsburg, PA, USA) used for the mobile phase in HPLC analysis was HPLC grade. All other solvents used in extraction and isolation of compounds were of analytical grade (Mallinkrodt Baker, SA, Xalostoc, Mexico) or home distilled.
PlantsVitex polygama and Siphoneugena densiflora were collected in July 2000, in the city of Poços de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora Herbarium (Minas Gerais) and at the Botany Institute Herbarium, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil, respectively.
Extraction and isolationThe powder of the air-dried plant organs was extracted successively with hexane and methanol by percolation at room temperature. Crude extracts were obtained after filtration and removal of the solvents under vacuum at 40 • C. Hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with methanol + water (50 + 50 by volume; 3 × 300 mL) with ultrasonic mixing for 10 min. The resulting filtrates were combined, evaporated under vacuum (40 • C) and lyophilized (Table 1). Some crude extracts were dissolved in water + methanol (1 + 1 by volume) and fractionated through liquid-liquid partition using solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol). The corresponding labeled layers are characterized in Table 1.Compounds 1 to 43 were obtained by submitting the most active extracts (see Table 2) to several chromatographic techniques. Procedures to isolate the substances bioassayed (1, 9, 14 to 18, 25, 26 and 43; see Fig. 1) are described below. Some of them, like compounds 15 and 16, were isolated from more than one different extract of the same plant.

Isolation of compounds 15 and 43 from Siphoneugena densiflora (SD-HAS extract)A quantity of 1.3 g and 300 mg of SD-HAS extract (Table 1) were subjected to CC using XAD7 (63.0 × 4.5 cm) and subsequent elution with 500 mL of water (XA), water + acetone (1 + 1 by volume) (XWA) and methanol + acetone (1 + 1 by volume) (XMA). The dried fraction XWA (672.8 mg) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (46.0 × 3.0 cm) using methanol as eluent. A total of 29 fractions of 30 mL were obtained and combined into ten fractions (XWA1 to XWA10). Both fractions 6 (XWA6) and 8 (XWA8) afforded brown powders identified as compounds 43 (78.6 mg) and 15 (97.3 mg) respectively.

Insect rearingLarvae of S. frugipereda used in the experiments were obtained from cultures at the Departamento de Entomologia, Fitopatologia e Zoologia Agrícola of the Escola Superior de Agronomia Luiz de Queiroz, Universidade de São Paulo (ESALQ/USP), and maintained in environmental chambers at 25 ± 1 • C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod. The artificial diet used for the bioassay and previously described 22 contained cooked 'carioca' bean 37.5 g, wheat germ 30.0 g, soy meal 15.0 g, casein 15.0 g, yeast extract 18.75 g, tetracycline 56.5 mg, agar 11.5 g, Vanderzant vitamin mixture for insects 4.5 mL, ascorbic acid 1.8 g, sorbic acid 0.9 g, methyl phydroxybenzoate 1.5 g, formaldehyde (40% v/v) 1.8 mL and distilled water 600 mL, in a total volume of 720 mL.
Toxicity bioassays by ingestion against
Spodoptera frugiperda 2.5.1 Crude extracts and layersA quantity of 100 mg of crude extracts or fractions was diluted in a small volume of acetone (e.g. 2 mL) along with ascorbic acid (ingredient of the artificial diet). The solvent was allowed to evaporate for 1 h, and the resultant mixture was ground to powder and incorporated into the liquid diet (100 g), at a final concentration of 1 mg g -1 . The liquid diet was distributed in portions (10 g) into ten glass tubes (8.5 × 2.5 cm, previously sterilized for 1 h at 170 • C), covered with sterile hydrofugous (not absorbent) cotton and then left for 24 h at room temperature to eliminate excess humidity. One first-instar S. frugiperda larva (from 0 to 3 h old) was then placed in each tube and held at 25 ± 1 • C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod for about 20 days until pupation (each experiment comprised ten glass tubes, each containing a single first-instar S. frugiperda larva, totaling 10 larvae). Mortality was determined for each larva every 24 h; cessation of movement followed by color change to black was the criterion used for judging mortality. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot's formula. 23 On the day after pupation, live pupae were weighed and transferred to transparent plastic vials (6.0 × 6.0 cm) containing filter paper at the bottom (4.0 × 4.0 cm), wetted by two drops of distilled water and maintained at the same conditions as the larvae until adults emerged (10-20 additional days). Other developmental factors were recorded, such as time to pupation and adult emergence.The control diet was prepared by adding the mixture of ascorbic acid and acetone previously evaporated and ground.Methanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts insoluble in acetone were prepared in methanol and water respectively, as well as their respective controls.
Isolated compoundsFour well plates (24 × 1.5 mL wells) were filled with the liquid diet and left for 1 h at room temperature in a decontaminated (UV light) laminar flow hood. Each compound (12.0 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL of distilled water, and 30 µL aliquots were layered on the top of each well containing the artificial congealed diet. The final concentration was about 0.1 mg g -1 . The surface excess solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 1 h under sterile conditions. Subsequently, a single second-instar S. frugiperda larva was placed on the diet mixture in each well and maintained for 10 days, under the same conditions as in Section 2.5.1. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbott's formula. 23 Each single experiment contained a total of 96 larvae (each plate of 24 wells with four replicates). Controls were carried out in a similar way without addition of the test compound.
Statistical analysisData consisting of the average value for each experimental unit were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences between treatment means were established by Tukey's test. 24 Results are given in the text as probability values, with P < 0.05 adopted as the criterion of significance. Complete statistical analysis was performed by means of the SAS program. 25 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Structure elucidation Substances 1 to 43 were identified by comparison of their NMR, MS, UV and IR spectroscopic data with data previously reported in the literature. Data are given only for those compounds that were tested independently (see Table 3).  ; UV and 1 H NMR data were identical to data previously reported. 27   a Each datum represents the mean of four replicates, each one set up with 24 larvae (n = 96). Compounds were tested at 0.1 mg g -1 . The controls were different, depending on the date of the experiment and the solvents used for compound dilution.

Compounds identified from the SD-EMR layer
Larval mortalityVery large differences in larval stage mortality, ranging from zero to 100% of the exposed larvae, resulted from treatments with different extracts (Table 2). S. densiflora polar extracts (SD-ML, SD-HAL, SD-MS, SD-HAS, SD-MT, SD-HAT, SD-MR, SD-HAR) were responsible for the highest mortalities (100%), followed by VP-HAL (60%), VP-HF (90%) and VP-HAF (100%) extracts from Vitex polygama, taking into account the treatment period (Table 2). They were then considered promising sources of active secondary metabolites and were further submitted to liquid-liquid partition. Partition of VP-HAL produced a VP-BHAL fraction with increased activity (100%), whereas the resultant fractions in the SD-MR partition (SD-EMR and SD-AMR respectively) retained the same potent activity as the original extract (100%, Table 2).The VP-MT extract (Table 2) was also fractionated, in spite of its lack of activity, on the basis of literature reports that a similar extract of Vitex madiensis caused death by disruption of the moulting cycle in S. frugiperda. 30 Ecdysteroids 9 to 12 (Fig. 1), known for their various effects on insects, 31 were obtained in the fractionation of this extract.Flavonoid 7, isolated from the VP-BHAL layer, is reported in the literature 32 to have an insecticidal effect, but it was not isolated in sufficient amounts to be bioassayed. The flavonoids quercetin (25)  and quercitrin (26) were highly active substances causing larval mortality of 78 and 85% (Table 3) respectively after 10 days of treatment. This result could be explained by earlier reports indicating that quercetin (25) may be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase, 33 of cytochrome P450dependent mixed function oxidases (MFO) 34 and of midgut glutathione S-transferases from S. frugiperda. 35 In addition, quercitrin (26), a flavonol glycoside, may be hydrolysed when ingested by some insects, so releasing its aglycone, quercetin. 32 The other compounds tested (Fig. 1) showed poor results, with a maximum larval mortality of 26%, a value statistically not significantly different (P < 0.05) from the control (Table 3). Compound 17, when layered on the top of the diet, became dark-brownish after a few hours, probably indicating oxidation and loss of activity.
Developmental effectsIn general, no statistically significant differences in pupation time and emergence were observed in the tests with extracts and fractions, except for two, VP-HL and VP-HF, which showed significantly extended larval periods of 6 and 15 days respectively above those of the controls (Table 2). Moreover, VP-HL caused 10% of malformed pupae, 20% of uncompleted second-instar larvae and 30% of pupae that did not reach adult stage.Compound 9, originating from an inactive extract (VP-MT, Table 2), caused a moderate but statistically significant larval weight loss in relation to the control after 10 days of treatment (P < 0.05; Table 3). The effects of ecdysteroids are known to be surprisingly complex and dependent on the concentration of compound and the developmental stage of the insect, 31 which could explain that result.Although the bioassay used does not address behavioral responses (inhibition of feeding), the results suggest that larval weight loss caused by compounds 14 and 43 (Table 3) may be correlated with feeding deterrence. In fact, it is known that tannins reduce plant palatability and act as inhibitors of digestion by precipitating food protein and digestive enzymes. 36 In addition, there is evidence that some species of Lepidoptera have taste receptors that respond to some phenolics. 32 However, tannins 15 and 17 were practically inactive in this respect, probably because some tannins may be oxidized 37 or hydrolyzed during passage through the insect gut, 36 reducing their effectiveness. According to Urrea-Bulla et al., 38 gallic acid (13), the compound isolated from several extracts of S. densiflora and also a probable product of hydrolysis of compound 14, significantly reduces larval growth of S. frugiperda at 1 mg g -1 .
CONCLUSIONSPolar extracts from S. densiflora and the VP-BHAL layer displayed considerable insecticidal activity, and may be efficient alternatives to conventional synthetic insecticides in the integrated pest management of S. frugiperda. Moreover, the feeding deterrence caused by tannin 14 along with the insecticidal effects of flavonoids 25 and 26 might explain the 100% outcome when the SD-ML extract was tested. In addition, compound 14 might be acting synergistically with 43, and in concert with daucosterol (19), known for its insecticidal action, 15 phenolic acid 13 and other3 Figure 1 .31Figure 1.
