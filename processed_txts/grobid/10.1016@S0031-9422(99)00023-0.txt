Two anthrones and one oxanthrone from Picramnia teapensis
From the bark of Picramnia teapensis were isolated 7-hydroxycoumarin, emodin, the oxanthrone mayoside and three new compounds: two anthrone glycosides named picramniosides D and E and an oxanthrone glycoside named mayoside B. These new compounds were separated by recycling-HPLC and were identi®ed on the basis of spectral data. CD was used to establish the absolute con®guration of the new compounds.

IntroductionPicramnia teapensis Tul. is a tree found in Central America, one of approximately 45 in the genus Picramnia. According to Engler, the genus Picramnia belongs to the Simaroubaceae, although chemotaxonomical and morphological considerations have recently led to the proposal that Picramnia be promoted to a new family, Picramniaceae (Fernando, & Quinn, 1995). Previous studies of the genus have led to the isolation of coumarins, anthraquinones, triterpenoids (Herz, Santhanam, & Wahlberg, 1972;Leon, & Juan, 1975;Popinigis, Moreira, Nakashima, Krambeck, & Miguel, 1980;Arana, & Julka, 1986) and, recently, anthrone and oxanthrone glycosides (SolõÂ s, GutieÂ rrez, GonzaÂ lez, Gupta, & Phillipson, 1995;HernaÂ ndez-Medel, LoÂ pez-Marquez, Santillan, & Trigos, 1996). Most of these compounds have shown interesting pharmacological properties (Fairbairn, 1964;Popinigis et al., 1980;Daguilh et al., 1986;SolõÂ s et al., 1995;Yagi, Yamauchi, & Kuwano, 1997). As part of our interest in the chemistry of Simaroubaceae, we describe here our ®ndings on P. teapensis.
Results and discussionThe ethyl acetate extract from the bark of Picramnia teapensis aorded 7-hydroxycoumarin (Razdan, Qadri, Harkar, & Waight, 1987), emodin (Cam, 1975) and predominantly a mixture of four emodin C-glycosides which were separated by recycling-HPLC. This mixture aorded two new anthrones named picramniosides D (1) and E (2), a new oxanthrone named mayoside B (3) and the oxanthrone 4. Compound 4 gave spectral data in agreement with those published for mayoside, which has been found previously in the bark of Picramnia hirsuta (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996). Its structure was further substantiated by HMQC and HMBC experiments in CD 3 OD (Tables 1 and2).Compounds 3 and 4 (C 26 H 24 O 11 ) gave similar ESI-MS and UV spectra. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 3 suggested a structure similar to 4, showing slight dierences in the aromatic pattern and chemical shifts. Notably, H-5, H-7 and H-11 were deshielded in 3, while H-2 and H-4 were shielded Table 1. The 13 C NMR spectra of 3 and 4 were almost identical except for the chemical shifts of the carbons near C-10 (C-4, C-4a, C-5, C-5a, C-6 and C-11, Table 2) In view of these dierences, it was concluded that 3 must be an Phytochemistry 51 (1999) 583±586 0031-9422/99/$ -see front matter # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. PII: S 0123456789alternate C-10 isomeric form of 4. The relative con-®guration of the sugar moiety for both compounds 3 and 4 was deduced from the chemical shift of C-1' to C-5 ' in the 13 C NMR, which were shown to be very closely related to those of 1 and 2. Moreover the multiplicity and the J value observed for the H-1 ' was very similar for all compounds suggesting the same relative con®guration of the sugar moiety. Picramniosides B and C, isolated previously from Picramnia antidesma ssp. fessonia (HernaÂ ndez- Medel et al., 1996), have been reported as comparable C-10 isomers.Compounds 1 and 2 (C 26 H 24 O 12 ) showed spectral characteristics close to those of 3 and 4 and of picramniosides B and C (SolõÂ s et al., 1995). The fundamental dierence between these two anthrones and the oxanthrones is at C-10. This carbon, carrying hydroxyl in 3 and 4 (d 76.3 and 76.7, respectively), now appeared shielded (d 44.4 for 1 and d 43.8 for 2, Table 2). In the HMQC spectra, C-10 signal showed correlation with the proton at d 4.36 (d, J=2.1 Hz), with a J value suggesting a dihedral angle with H-5 ' close to 858. In the HMBC spectra H-10 was correlated with C-4, C-5 and C-5' (Table 3) and H-1 ' and H-20 were correlated with the carbonyl carbon of the benzoyl substituent, thus con®rming the location of the sugar moiety and the exact position of the benzoate group in the glycoside. Multiplicity and J values clearly con®rmed the xylose nature of the sugar moiety, as shown previously for the other picramniosides and mayosides.The CD spectrum of 1 showed a positive Cotton eect at 221.8 and 359.8 nm and a negative Cotton eect at 269.0 and 300.0 nm, similar to those reported for (10S ) picramnioside A (SolõÂ s et al., 1995). This observation allowed us to establish the absolute con®guration of 1 as (10R ) picramnioside D. Consequently, the absolute con®guration of 2 is (10S ) picramnioside E. Similar associations permitted the establishment of 3 as (10R ) mayoside B. The absolute con®guration of 4 has been previously reported as (10S ) mayoside (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996). These results are concordant with the conformational studies of aloins  (Manitto, Monti, & Speranza, 1990) and cascarosides (Manitto et al., 1993).
