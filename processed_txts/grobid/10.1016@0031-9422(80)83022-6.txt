PTEROCARPANS FROM SWARTZZA LAEVICARPA"
An ethanol extract of the trunkwood from Swartzia laeuicarpa (Leguminosae)   gave four (6aR,llaR)-8hydroxy-3,9-dimethoxypterocarpans differentiated by additional 2-hydroxy, 2-hydroxy-lo-methoxy, 4,10-dimethoxy and 2-hydroxy-4,10-dimethoxy substitution; besides two 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methylisocoumarins differentiated by 5-chloro and 7-chloro substitution;5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy-2-methylchromone and the known 8-hydroxy-5methyl-3,4-dihydroxyisocoumarin.

INTRODUCTION
Rationalizationof the ethnopharmacological importance of Swartzia [2] is not yet possible. In spite of the wide distribution over Africa and chiefly South America, little is known about the chemical composition of the genus. Three of its ca 130 species, the African S. madagascariensis and S. leiocalycina and the South American S. ulei Harms were analysed and found to contain pterocarpanoids (Table 1). The present paper reports the occurrence offour additional pterocarpans and of some other constituents in a fourth species, S. laeuicarpa Amsh. (= S. benthamiana Bth.) from a forest near Manaus, Amazonas, which is periodically innundated by the Rio Negro. The species is widely distributed over the basin of the Amazonas river. Its dark heartwood is much appreciated in Manaus, where it is sold under the name 'saboarana' [6].
RESULTSThe four pterocarpans Ij-Itn were recognised as such by the typical NMR signals corresponding to the ABMXsystemoffour protons [3,7] and,inthecaseoflk,thethree carbons (6 40.8, C-6a; 66.4, C-6; 78.2, C-l la) of the central oxygen-heterocyclic rings. Assignment of aromatic proton signals by chemical shift and multiplicity is trivial (Table 2), chiefly ifthe 3,9-dioxygenation pattern, ubiquitous in all 77 previously reported pterocarpanoids, is assumed to exist      R,R R,R R,R R,R R,R R,R R,R R,R R,R R,R R,R R,R R,present cases. For 1 k hydrogenolysis and MS of the resulting isoflavan 3 revealed the distribution of hydroxy methoxy groups among the two aromatic rings. The relative location of OH-OMe followed. in all cases, comparative 'H NMR analysis of the spectrum of the compounds and their acetates (Table2). The assignment of hydroxyls to C-2 and C-3 in Ik was confirmed bq paramagnetic pyridine-induced 'H NMR shifts [8 3: AciO.49 (H-l ), 0.27 (H-4). 0.46 (H-7); as well as by 13C NMR comparison of the compound and its acetate [9]:paramagneticshiftsof9.3 (C-l)and7.8 (C-7).Thrfour ptcrocarpans lj~lmarccharacterired bgthesamemultiple ORD Cotton effects in the 250 -350 nm region as the three ( -)-pterocarpans from Drrlhegicr .sprucrc~zm Benth. [ 10 ] and must thus possess the same 6aR,1 IaR-configuration. Besides sitosterol and stigmasterol. four additional compounds with molecular formulae C, lH,zO, (4), C, I H,ClO, (Sa, 5b) and C, ?H, 2Oj (6) were isolated from the extract. The known dihydroisocoumarin 4 was identified by direct comparison with an authentic sample [ 111. Isocoumarin or chromone skeletons were proposed for the remaining three compounds in view of MS, M W, IR and 'H NMR characteristics which included quartets (-I = 0.5 Hz) for olefinic proton signals. The coupling with methyl protons thus indicated wah confirmed by the appearance of C-Me signals as doublets (J = 0.5 Hz) and by double resonance experiments. The chemical shifts of the olefinic proton signals, 5 3.34 and 3.36 for 5a and 5b vs 3.82 for 6 is diagnostic respectively for isocoumarins (t333.6 [12 15])vschromones(r3.8 4.1 [16,17]).The carbonyls of all three compounds are chelated by hydroxyls at the adjacent aromatic positions (AICI, shifts of UV maxima). In both isocoumarins these hydroxyls must be rnrttr-related with methoxyls, the lone aromatic protons being exposed to the shielding ell'cct of two OXYsubstituents (r 3.47 5a, 3.44 5b). Finally, the Cl atoms were assigned to C-7 in 5a and C-5 in 5b in view of respectively positive and negative Gibbs tests [ 181. Acet~ lation of the chromone results in a 0.22 ppm paramagnetic shift of the 'H NMR singlet at r 3.62. The lone aromatic proton must thus be eithei.or'll~o-or prrra-related with the hydroxyl, the former alternative (6) being more likely in view of a negative Gibbs test [I 81. It has been observed [i 11 that the presence of polyketides, such as isocoumarins and chromones, in the wood of a flowering plant could be due to contamination by fungi during storage prior to extraction. Ifcontamination had occurred again in the present case. the possibly antifungal pterocarpanoids [ 191 may have been restricted to the resistant heartwood.
