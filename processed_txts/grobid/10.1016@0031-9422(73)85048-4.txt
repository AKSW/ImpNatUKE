ISO-AND NEO-FLAVONOIDS FROM DALBERGIA RIPARIA*
Plant. Dalbergia riparia (Mart.)  Bth., shrub or creeper, subfamily Leguminosae-Lotoideae.zSource. Flooded banks of the Amazon river and its tributaries. wood. The powdered wood (5 kg) was extracted with EtOH. The CsH, soluble portion of the extract was chromatographed on silica, yielding in order tectorigenin (300 mg),3 (S)-4-methoxydalbergione (30 mg)," (6aS,l laS)-demethylhomopterocarpin (100 mg),5 dalbergin (300 mg)," 7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyisoflavone (50 mg), afromosin (30 mg)" and caviunin (150 mg).7 The benzene insoluble portion of the extract was chromatographed on silica yielding in order dalbergin (10 mg), a 7-O-glycosylcaviunin (100 mg) and tectoridin (2 g)." The identification of the known compounds was confirmed by direct comparison with authentic samples. The structure of 7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3',4'methylenedioxyisoflavone, was deduced by spectral means. Its methyl ether proved to be identical, by direct comparison, with 6,7-dimethoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyisoflavone,9 kindly provided by Prof. S. H. Harper. The identification of tectoridin involved hydrolysis to glucose and tectorigenin. The sugar of the 7-O-glycosylcaviunin was not characterized. It can only occupy the 7-position since the heteroside sustains a free hydroxyl at C-5 (shift of UV maxima upon addition of AlCl,).

The mixture was cooled and extracted with CHCIJ. The CHCI, was washed, dried and evaporated. The residue was recrystallized from MeOH, giving caviunin (5 mg).Phylochemi&y '. 1973, Vol. 12, pp.   Key Word Index-Poecilantheparvifora; Leguminosae; Ilavanone; isoflavones; isoflavanone.In central Brazil 'cora#io de negro' or 'pau-ferro' designate a number of species belonging to different families which, such as Poecilantheparviflora Benth. (Leguminosae-Lotoideae), yield durable timber. In an attempt to isolate the antifungal principles, the trunk wood of P. parviJlora, collected in the Linhares Reserve, near Vitoria, Espirito Santo State, was examined and found to contain, besides nerolidol and (2S)-sakuranetin (Ta),2 a colourless compound and a yelllw crystalline product which was apparently homogenous upon examination by TLC. Elementary, MS and functional analysis established the formula CZOH1303 (OH), for this yellow compound.This and the UV spectrum were consistent with a feebly acidic (absence of 7-OH) 5-hydroxyisoflavone (AICI,-shift).While the PMR).
