NEOLIGNANS FROM ANIBA TERMINALIS"
A benzene extract of the trunk wood of Aniba terminalis (Lauraceae) contained besides benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, d, 1 -camphor and sitosterol, (2S,3$3aR)-and (2R,3S,3aS)-3a-allyl-5methoxy-3-methyl-Zpiperonyl-2,3,3a,6-tetrahydrod-oxobenzofurans, which may be responsible, through sequential rearrangements of the Cope, retro-Claisen and Claisen types, and finally dehydrogenation, for the formation of the co-occurring (2S,3S,5S)-and (2R,3S,5R)-5-allyl-5-methoxy-3-methyl-2-piperonyl-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofurans, the (2S,3S)-6-0-allyl-5-methoxy-3-methyl-2-piperonyl-2,3_dihydrobenzofuran, the (2S,3S)-and (2R,3S)-7-allyl-6-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-methyl-Zpiperonyl-2,3_dihydrobenzofuran and the 7-allyl-6-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-methyl-2-piperonylbenzofuran.

Neolignans of structural types 1, 2, 3 and 4 cooccur in the C,H,-extract of an Aniha sp. [l]. The opinion that all four represent natural products originating from an isoeugenol-eugenol oxidative dimer (type 1) by successive in viva rearrangements was based on the stability of derivatives belonging to types 1 and 2 under extraction conditions. Additional evidence stems from the fact that in Aniba terminalis representatives of these same types are accompanied by 5. Dehydrogenation of 2,3_dihydrobenzofuranswould not be expected to occur during manipulation of the plant or extract, and a reasonable rationalization of the biosynthetically unusual placement of the ally1 substituent in 5 involves a sequence of reactions in which 2, 3 and 4 would function as intermediates.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe NMR features of dihydrobenzofuran neolignans are well known [lM]. The structures of the compounds belonging to types 14 were thus deduced with ease. The particular dienone systems of 1 and 2 were further characterized by IR and UV spectra (v,,,;,~ 1645 and 1685 cm-' respectively: i,,,,,lX 28.5 and 3 14 nm respectively). The relative positibn of the O-ally1 and O-methyl substitucnts in 3 was inferred from considerations concerning the biogenesis of the compound. Analogous evidence, also decisive for structural assignments in the case of compounds 4 and 5, was partially confirmed by determining NMR spectral modifications due to acetylation in the latter case. Constancy of position of the aromatic proton sin&let established the j?zeta-relationship of H and OH. while diamagnetic shifts of the CH2-CH= and OMe resonances established the o~tho-relationship of the ally1 and the methoxyl data showed this compound to belong to the (2S,3S)-2-aryl-3-methyl series of 2,3-dihydrobenzofurans [1,2]. Product 4 was again a 1:1.2 mixture of 4a (Me r 8.67) and 4b (Me 5 9.19). The absolute stereochemical assignments in the formulae were based solely on the probable interrelationship of A. tc~~riG1u1i.s constituents of the tl'ar1s-(la ---f 2a+3+4a) and the cis-( I b--f 2b --+ 4b) series.The leaves of this species [S] contain 4-methoxyparacotoin [6]. in addition to benzyl benzoate and benzyl salicylate.
