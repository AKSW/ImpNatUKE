Triterpene Benzoates from the Bark of Picramnia teapensis (Simaroubaceae)
Da casca do caule de Picramnia teapensis Tul. foram isolados dois novos benzoatos triterpênicos, o 3a,7b-dibenzoato do ácido lup-20(29)-en-28-óico e o 7b-benzoato do ácido 3ahidroxi-lup-20(29)-en-28-óico. A elucidação estrutural desses compostos foi fundamentada na análise dos dados espectroscópicos. Outros compostos conhecidos, b-sitosterol, estigmasterol, lupeol e epilupeol, foram identificados em mistura por CG-EM. Nenhum dos triterpenos benzoilados mostrou efeito inibitório no crescimento in-vitro do Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Fisher), também citado como Leucocoprinus gongylophorus (Heim), syn Rozites gongylophora (Möller), o fungo simbionte cultivado pelas formigas cortadeiras de folhas Atta sexdens L.Two new benzoic acid esters of triterpene alcohols [lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid 3a,7b-dibenzoate and 3a-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid 7b-benzoate] were isolated from the stem bark of Picramnia teapensis Tul. The structures of these compounds were established on the basis of spectral analyses. Other known compounds, b-sitosterol, estigmasterol, lupeol and epilupeol, were identified in mixture by GC-MS. The triterpene esters have not shown in-vitro inhibitory effect on the growth of Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Fisher), referred also as Leucocoprinus gongylophorus (Heim), syn Rozites gongylophora (Möller), the symbiotic fungus cultivated by the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens L.

IntroductionThe genus Picramnia is restricted to the neotropic region. According to Engler, the genus Picramnia belongs to Simaroubaceae, but Fernando & Quinn have promoted Picramnia to a new family named Picramniaceae 1 .We have previously described our findings on the chemical study of P. teapensis, a tree found in Central America 2,3 . The study of the ethyl acetate extract of the stem bark from this plant has led to the isolation and characterization of two C-glycosylated anthrones (picramniosides D, E); two C-glycosylated oxanthrones (mayoside and mayoside B); a C,O-diglycosylated anthrone (picramnioside F); a C,O-diglycosylated oxanthrone (mayoside C); two anthraquinone glycosides (1-O-b-Dglucopyranosyl emodin and 8-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl emodin) as well as emodin and umbelliferone 2,3 . Some of them showed antifungal activity against Leucoagaricus gongylophorus the symbiotic fungus cultivated by the leafcutting ants Atta sexdens L 3 . These ants are known as serious pest in agriculture and forestry in Brazil 4 . During the last decade we have been looking for a natural control of this pest without ecological injury, working on toxicity and repellence of plant extracts and plant products potentially toxic to Atta and their symbiotic fungus [5][6][7] .This report deals with the isolation and identification of new lupane triterpene benzoates, from the chloroform extract of the stem bark from P. teapensis and the test of antifungal activity of the isolated compounds.
Results and DiscussionThe chloroform extract from the stem bark of P. teapensis afforded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds 1 and 2, which were separated by column chromatography on silica gel. The lupane triterpenes benzoates 1 and 2 were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data, including COSY, DEPT, HMQC and HMBC experiments. Compound 1 was identified as lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid 3a,7b-dibenzoate and compound 2, in minor quantities, was identified as 3a-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid 7b-benzoate by comparison of 1 H and 13 C NMR data with those of compound 1.Compound 1 had a molecular formula C 44 H 56 O 6 , as determined by 13 C NMR and DEPT analysis and confirmed by HREIMS. The IR spectrum of 1 exhibited bands at 3428 cm -1 (n O-H, broad), 2929 cm -1 (terminal methylene function), 1713 cm -1 (n C=O of ester function), 1274 cm -1 , 1114 cm -1 (n C-O) and 713 cm -1 (aromatic ring). The  1 and the data are supported by the DEPT, COSY, HMQC and HMBC experiments. These assignments are comparable with those of structures with the same skeleton previously reported 8 . The location of the benzoate groups was established as follows: the signal at d 4.87 (broad t, 2.6 Hz), corresponding to H-3, showed correlation with the carbonyl of the benzoate at d 166.0 in the HMBC experiment and the coupling constant indicates an equatorial position of this proton, so the benzoate group must be a. The shielding effect suffered by C-1 (d 34.2) and C-5 (d 49.2) confirmed the relative configuration at C-3. The position of the benzoate at C-7 was determined by the observation of the correlations, in an HMBC experiment (Table 2), of the protons at Me-26 with C7, C-8, C-9 and C-14, and also of H-7 with C-26. The high shielding effect observed for the methyl at C-26 (d 11.7) is reported for skeletons with hydroxyl or esterification in the b position at C-7 8,9 . The coupling constants exhibited by H-7 (5.2 and 10.1 Hz) indicate that it must be axial, so the relative configuration at C-7 is with the benzoic ester in the b position.EIMS data of compound 1 exhibited the expected ester fragmentation, benzoic acid being a prominent eliminated product, with fragments at m/z 558 ([M-PhCO 2 H]) and m/z 436 ([M-2PhCO 2 H]). The molecular ion peak at m/z 680, the base peak at m/z 105 ([C 6 H 5 CO] + ), and other important fragments at m/z 635 ([M-HCO 2 H]), 248, 202, 201, 188, 187 and 173 were observed (Figure 1). The fragmentation pattern strongly indicated the nature of the lup-20(29)-ene with esterifications at rings A/B.Compound 2, C 37 H 52 O 5 , exhibited the same spectroscopic characteristics as 1, with exception of those of ring A, having the following main 1 H and 13 C NMR data differences: the spectra showed the presence of only five aromatic protons showing the characteristic pattern of a benzoic group; the signal for H-3, in a b orientation, appeared as a shielded broad triplet at d 3.42. Therefore the signal of C-2 (d 25.4) was deshielded and the C-3 signal (d 75.9) shielded in comparison with the signals in 1, as occurs in other lupanes with 3-a-hydroxyl 8 .Compound 2 was isolated in too small amount to observe all the quaternary carbons by 13 C NMR. 1 H and 13 C NMR attributions shown in Table 1 are consistent with the observations made in DEPT 135 and HMBC experiments. The correlations observed by HMBC were basically from the six methyl groups on the lupane skeleton (Table 2). The correlation of C-26 and C-2' with H-7 confirmed the position of the benzoic ester. Some signals were attributed by comparison with the data of compound 1.  The EIMS spectrum of compound 2 did not show the molecular ion peak because of the lost of benzoic acid. Some of the observed fragments were at m/z 454 ([M-C 6 H 5 CO 2 H]), m/z 122 ([C 6 H 5 CO 2 H] +. ) and m/z 105 ([C 6 H 5 CO] + ), being the base peak at m/z 77 ([C 6 H 5 ] + ). The fragmentation pattern shown in Figure 1 was also observed as in compound 1.The chloroform extract from the stem bark of P. teapensis also afforded a mixture of b-sitosterol, stigmasterol, lupeol and epilupeol which were identified by GC-MS and by comparison of EIMS spectra and co-injection in GC of authentic samples available in our laboratory.Compounds 1 and 2 were tested in the growth inhibition assay of Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, using the methodology described by Pagnocca et al. 5 . These new compounds have not shown inhibitory effect against growth of L. gongylophorus at concentration of 100 mg mL -1 . 1-O-b-D-Glucopyranosyl emodin and 8-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl emodin, isolated from this plant, were used as positive controls since they showed complete inhibition of the fungus growth at a concentration of 50 mg mL -1 3 .

Plant materialThe stem bark of P. teapensis was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San José de la Montana in September 1990 and identified by Dr. Luis Jorge Poveda. A voucher (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional of Costa Rica, Heredia.
Extraction and isolation of the chemical constituentsDried and powdered stem bark of P. teapensis (615 g) was macerated with EtOH 80%. The extract was filtered and concentrated under vacuum, and part of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H 2 O and CHCl 3 . VLC fractionation of the concentrated chloroform layer (2.37 g) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with hexane-CH 2 Cl 2 and CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 50 fractions, 25 mL each. These fractions were combined in 12 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction 5 (107.3 mg) was crystallized in CH 2 Cl 2 /acetone and its constitution was analyzed by GC-MS. Four compounds were identified from this fraction: b-sitosterol, estigmasterol, lupeol and epilupeol 10 . Fraction 6 (160.8 mg) was submitted to chromatographic separations on silica gel columns using as eluents hexane, CH 2 Cl 2 and MeOH, and yielding the triterpene benzoates 1 (10.2 mg) and 2 (1.0 mg).

Key signals indicated other functional groups of the lupane skeleton: i) the signal at d 179.3 corresponding to a carbonyl carbon of a carboxylic acid function, ii) two carbonyl carbons of conjugated ester functions (d 166.0 and 165.8) and aromatic signals corresponding to the benzoic ester ring, and iii) two signals of carbinolic carbons (d 78.7 and 77.6). The assignments of 13 C and 1 H RMN spectra are shown in Table1 HNMR spectrum of 1 displayed six signals for methyl groupsat d 0.93, 0.95, 0.96, 1.18, 1.31 and 1.69. This last valuesuggested the presence of one methyl group attached to anunsaturated carbon. Furthermore, vinylic protons signalsappeared at d 4.74 (1H, d, J 1.6 Hz) and d 4.61 (1H, s) andthe signal for one allylic proton appeared at d 3.01 (broadtd, J 11.1, 4.6 Hz). The spectrum also showed twoacycarboxylic protons at d 4.87 (broad t, J 2.6 Hz) and d5.40 (dd, J 10.1, 5.2 Hz). Signals at d 7.46-8.10 (10 H)showed the typical pattern of the benzoate group (Table1), the integration indicating the presence of two benzoategroups.The 13 C NMR spectrum of 1 confirmed the nature ofthe triterpene skeleton, as a lup-20(29)-ene triterpenoidstructure, with signals of the terminal olefinic bond at d150.3 and 109.8.
