Anthrone and oxanthrone C,O-diglycosides from Picramnia teapensis
Two C,O-diglycosylated compounds, the anthrone picramnioside F, and the oxanthrone mayoside C, were isolated from the stem bark of Picramnia teapensis, along with the previously reported anthraquinones, 1-O-b-d-and 8-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin. The compounds were separated by recycling-HPLC, and their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. CD measurements were used to establish the absolute con®guration of the anthrone and oxanthrone. The antifungal activity of 1-O-b-d-and 8-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin against Leucoagaricus gongilophorus was shown to be similar to that of the lignan sesamin.

IntroductionIn a previous paper (RodrõÂ guez-Gamboa et al., 1999) we reported the isolation and characterization of two Cglycosylated anthrones (picramniosides D, E), and two C-glycosylated oxanthrones (mayoside and mayoside B), as well as emodin and umbelliferone, from the stem bark of Picramnia teapensis Tul., a tree found in Central America. Further investigations aorded, in minor quantities, two new C,O-diglycosylated compounds: an anthrone, picramnioside F (1), and an oxathrone, mayoside C (2), along with the known anthraquinone glycosides, 1-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (3) and 8-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl emodin (4). The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was determined by comparison with sesamin, a lignan active against Leucoagaricus gongilophorus (Pagnocca et al., 1996). This report deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of compounds 1 and 2, and the antifungal activity of the isolated compounds.
Results and discussionThe EtOAc extract from the bark of P. teapensis aorded, in minor quantities, a mixture of compounds 1± 4, which was separated by recycling-HPLC on a Shimadzu polymeric packing column. The anthraquinones 3 and 4 were identi®ed on the basis of spectroscopic data and by comparison with published data (Rawat et al., 1989;Coskun et al., 1990;Inoue et al., 1992).Compound 1 was obtained as a yellow amorphous solid.  0123456789 All of the spectroscopic characteristics of 1 were coincident with those of anthrones which we have previously reported (RodrõÂ guez-Gamboa et al., 1999), showing UV absorptions at l max 228, 274 and 340 nm, and IR absorptions typical of hydroxyl (3387 cm À1 ), ester carbonyl (1735 cm À1 ) and chelated carbonyl (1639 cm À1 ) groups. The 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed two groups of signals in the aromatic region, one at 7.4±7.8 (5H), typical of a benzoyl group, and two pairs of meta-coupled protons from an emodin anthrone moiety. The methyl protons at 1.84 (3H) and a doublet at 4.48, characteristic of H-10 of an anthrone (RodrõÂ guez-Gamboa et al., 1999), were also observed. The spectrum showed signals for two anomeric protons at 5.82 and 4.97, and a complex group of signals at 3.40±3.95, indicating sugar moieties.The presence of 33 carbons was evident from the 13 C NMR spectrum (Table 1). The C-10 signal of the anthrone was observed at 44.8 and the anomeric carbons at 95.8 and 105.4. Signals in the region of 62±81 indicated the presence of two sugar moieties, one of them being lyxose, previously characterized in mayoside, uveoside and saroside (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). In a previous paper (RodrõÂ guez-Gamboa et al., 1999) the sugar name of picramniosides D±E as well as of mayoside and mayoside B was cited as xylose, but the structures and the spectroscopic data are in agreement with lyxose (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1996, 1998, 1999). The previous name was based on SolõÂ s et al. (1995) which identi®ed the sugar of picramniosides A±C as xylose. The signals of the sugar unit bonded at C-8-O were typical of glucose (Manitto et al., 1993). DEPT experiments con®rmed only one CH 2 signal at 61.5, corresponding to C-6 of the glucose unit.Complete assignment of the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopic signals (Table 1) was established on the basis of one-bond and long-range 2D-NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and NOESY). In particular, diagnostic correlations were as follows: (i) 3 J coupling between the ester carbonyl ( 164.7) and H-1 H , H-2 HH and H-6 HH , indicating the linkage of the benzoyl group to C-1 H of the lyxose sugar; and (ii) 3 J coupling between H-10 of the anthrone and C-5 H ( 81.4), con-®rming the position of the aglycone at C-5 H of lyxose. Furthermore, another seven correlations with C-10 were observed (Table 2), and a 3 J correlation of the anomeric proton of the glucose unit (H-1, 4.97) and C-8, and the spatial correlation with H-7 in the NOESY experiment reinforced the position of the O-glucose unit at C-8.The magnitude of the coupling constant between H-5 H and H-10 (2.3 Hz) indicated an eq±eq conformation for these protons. The con®guration of the lyxose at the anthrone moiety must be b, based on comparison with other anthrone glycosides (SolõÂ s et al., 1995;HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1998;RodrõÂ guez-Gamboa et al., 1999). No correlation was observed between H-1 H and H-2 H (J=0 Hz) suggesting an eq±eq conformation for these protons. Likewise, the J value of H-5 HHH (12 Hz) indicated an ax±ax conformation for H-5 HHH and H-4 HHH in the most stable glucopyranosyl moiety.Further observations helped to establish the con®guration at C-10. The spectral data of ring A of 1 ( 1 H and 13 C NMR) were almost identical to those of picramnioside E (RodrõÂ guez- Gamboa et al., 1999). In addition, the fol-lowing expected dierences in ring B were observed: (i) deshielding of H-7, C-1a and C-7, and (ii) shielding of C-5 and C-8 due to O-glucosylation at C-8.Compound 2 was isolated as a yellow amorphous solid. The PI-ESIMS spectrum of 2 gave pseudo-molecular ions at m/z 709 ([M+Na] + ) and 725 ([M+K] + ). The NI-ESIMS spectrum gave a molecular ion at 685.3 ([M-H] À ), which was consistent with the molecular formula C 33 H 34 O 16 . The daughter ions, from an MS±MS experiment, indicated the sequential loss of benzoic acid (m/z 563), lyxose (m/z 432), CH 2 OH (m/z 401), and the rest of the glucose unit, leading to the fragment corresponding to emodin (269).As observed previously for the mayosides (HernaÂ ndez- Medel et al., 1996Medel et al., , 1999;;RodrõÂ guez-Gamboa et al., 1999), the 1 H NMR spectrum of 2 showed the same pattern described for 1, except for the absence of the H-10 signal (Table 1). Particularly, ring B of 2 had almost identical 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopic data as those of mayoside B (RodrõÂ guez- Gamboa et al., 1999). O-Glyco-sylation at C-1 was suggested by the deshielding of C-2 and H-2 from compound 2 at ring A.Assignment of NMR signals was made on the basis of an HSQC experiment, and by comparison with published data (RodrõÂ guez-Gamboa et al., 1999). Although HMBC and NOESY experiments did not aord all of the expected information, some correlations were detected and they are listed at Table 2. In particular, the correlation of H-1 HHH with C-1 ( 162) helped to con®rm the position of the glucose at the anthraquinone moiety. In the NOESY experiment, the almost identical chemical shifts of the H-2 (6.74) and H-7 (6.73) signals, made it impossible to distinguish which proton (H-2 or H-7) had a spatial interaction with H-1 HHH .Circular dichroism con®rmed the absolute con®guration at C-10 of 1 and 2 as S and R, respectively. The CD data of C values based on HSQC and HMBC experiments. b Not observed. c May be exchangeable.1 and 2 presented the same Cotton eects as picramnioside B and E (SolõÂ s et al., 1995;RodrõÂ guez-Gamboa et al., 1999) and saroside (HernaÂ ndez-Medel et al., 1999), namely a negative Cotton eect near 270 and 315 nm, and a positive Cotton eect near 350 nm.The compounds mayoside B, picramnioside E, 3, 4, emodin and umbelliferone were tested in the growth inhibition assay of Leucoagaricus gongilophorus, using the methodology described by Pagnocca et al. (1996). The results are shown in Table 3. Compounds 3 and 4 presented appreciable activity, being more active than sesamin, a lignan common in Sesamum indicum. Emodin and umbelliferone were also active, and their mixture seem to increase the growth inhibition of the fungi (Table 3). The other compounds were not assayed due to lack of material.

Plant materialThe bark of P. teapensis was collected in Costa Rica, in the region of San JoseÂ de la MontanÄ a, September, 1990. A voucher specimen (CR194274) was deposited in the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Heredia, Costa Rica.
Isolation of constituentsDried and powdered bark of P. teapensis (615 g) was macerated with EtOH±H 2 O (4:1, v/v). The extract was ®ltered and concentrated under vacuum, and 50% of it (10.3 g) was partitioned between H 2 O and CHCl 3 . The aq. layer was extracted sequentially with EtOAc and then n-BuOH. VLC fractionation of the EtOAc extract (668 mg) on silica gel was carried out, eluting with CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity, to yield 80 fractions, each of 50 ml. These fractions were divided into 13 groups on the basis of analytical TLC. Fraction ten was subjected to HPLC separation on a polymeric packing column (Shimadzu, Asahipak GS-310 P, 21.5 cm IDÂ50.0 cm l) using MeOH for elution (Flow rate: 7 ml min À1 UV detector at 254 nm), to aord compound 1 (16 mg, 0.005% w/w) and 40 mg (0.013% w/w) of a mixture of 1-O-b-(3) and 8-O-b-glucopyranosyl emodin (4). Further puri®cation of 3 (20 mg, 0.007% w/w) and 4 (18 mg, 0.006 w/w) was carried out by HPLC (two cycles of 40 min in the recycling mode, using the same conditions previously described). Fraction 11 was submitted to HPLC separation under the same conditions (6.5 ml min À1 , 7 cycles) to aord pure compound 2 (1.2 mg, 0.0004% w/w).
