FORMATION OF UBIQUINONE BY TOBACCO PLANT CELLS IN SUSPENSION CULTURE*
of linear growth differed more among test species than did overall fresh weight. Even the most sensitive assay, root extension in lettuce required a psilotin concentration of 0*3mM. Levels of this magnitude are not indicative of a particularly potent regulator. However, the reported psilotin contents of O&1*22% (fr. wt) [1,2] corresponds to ca 4-37 mmoljkg of tissues hence fall easily within the range of inhibitory concentrations.The concept of psilotin as part of a regulatory system is reinforced by the demonstration that its inhibitory effects are reversed by glutathione, other thio-compounds and gibberellin A3 (Table 2). Glutathione, thiourea and thioproline at 1 mM restore nearly full germination to seeds near the ID,, level in 5 mM psilotin. Hydroxyproline, lacking the reducing group, is inactive, but gibberellin A3 is cz lO-lOO-fold more active than the thiols.These responses underscore the coumarin-like character of psilotin [4&J as well as its potential role in growth regulation.  According to our investigations [S], tobacco cells in suspension culture appear to contain much more ubiquinone-10 than the parent plants and so might be a suitable source for the large scale production of this compound. In order to obtain basic information on the synthesis of ubiquinone-10 by cultured plant cells, some observations on the variation in the ubiquinone content during the growth of the cultured cells have been made and are detailed in this paper.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe time-course of ubiquinone formation during cell growth was examined using three kinds of cultured cells EXPERIMENTALTest materials used in the survey included seeds of turnip, Brussica rupa cv Purple Top White Globe; lettuce, Lacruca sativa cv Iceberg; and onion, Allium cepa cv Yellow Globe. Seed and seedling tests were carried out in petri dishes on moist filter paper at 24" under 500 Ix daylight fluorescent light. Germination data are based upon 4-5 replicates each with 75-125 seeds. Growth measurements were based upon triplicates of 35-50 seedlings each. ID,, values (concentrations required for M"/, inhibition) were obtained by graphical interpolation.

chromatographed on a SiO, column. Elution with C,H,--CHCl, 7:3 to 1:l gave an oil from which a compound, C1,H2e04 (UOmg), was isolated by preparative TLC. This was recognized as a dihydroxy-dimethoxy-1,3diarylpropane by its 'HMR spectrum in which appeared signals due to a CHa flanked by two ArCH, systems, two OMe groups and six aromatic protons. One of the aryls is 3,4dioxygenated, as evidenced by proton signals between z 3.15 and 3.35 whose multiplicity can be analysed in the spectrum of the diacetate. The other one is 2,4-dioxygenated as shown by a doublet (7 3.62, J 2 Hz) and a triplet (7 358, J 8 & 2Hz) at the high field, and a doublet (7 300, J 8Hz) at the low field sides of the aromatic region. The signals due to all six aromatic protons were shifted paramagnetically upon formation of the diacetate, reason why one OH, and, consequently, one OMe, must be located on each of the rings. This symmetrical distribution is indicated also by the simplicity of the MS, compatible with the formation of fragments of identical mass from either ring. Intense peaks due to O-quinoRemethide ions characterize 1,3&arylpropanes with o-hy&oxyl [lf. In the present case such a peak would appear &t m/e 136. Its absence locates the methoxyl at the o-position. Since thus the OH in the ring under scrutiny must occupy the p-position, a positive Gibbs test of the compound locates the OH of the other ring at the m-position, as in la. This is the isomer of the Gibbs test negative metaholite lb of Zryzntkru coriuceu Ducke for which very similar rHMR and MS were reported [S].

INTRODUCTION Since their discovery by Lester [l] and Morton [Z], ubiquinones have received much attention from many workers in various fields of research. In the case of cultured plant cells, Threlfall and Goodwin [3] reported the occurrence of ubiquinone-10 in Paul's scarlet rose while Thomas and Stobart examined the time-course of ubi-&none and a-tbcopherol formation in Kaluncko2 cl'enqa callus [4].
