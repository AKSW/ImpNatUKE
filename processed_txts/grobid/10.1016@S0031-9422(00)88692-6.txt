DIASIN, A DITERPENE FROM CRQTON D/AS_lrc
Ahstraet-The trunkwood of Cro!on diasii Pit-es (Euphorbiaceae) contains diasin, a novel rearranged Labdanic diterpene which includes furan, carbomethoxy, ji-and &lactone moieties. All ' 3C NM R signals were assigned and used in conjunction with PMR data, for the elucidation of the relative configuration of all chiral centers. A possible biogenetic pathway to diasin is discussed. 
RESULTSFractionation of the C,H, extract of the trunkwood led to the isolation of sitosterol, ferulates of fatty alcohols and a compound designated diasin. The 0 atoms of its molecular formula C2,HL107, determined by HRMS, were assigned to p-lactone (11~~ 1700 cm-'1 &lactone (v 1740 cm -') ester (rmsx 1720 cm-') and furan (v,,,,~ 31??, 1500, 87Ocm-r) moieties. The furan is @-substituted, as indicated by PMR signals (Table 1) typical of one fl(6 6.42) and two a (6 7.44) protons. The base peak of the MS (m/e 94.0416) most probably is also due to this system linked to a vinyl group (talc. m/e 94.0419). In the parent compound, the C, group linked to furan is saturated. This fact is revealed by PMR, both the methine and one of the methylene hydrogens being represented by double doublets. The methine signal is easily analysed, since it appears at characteristically low field (6 5.45). The LIS-reagent Eu(fod), was used at 270 MHz to shift at least one of the methylene signals towards the low field end of the band envelope around 2 ppm. These band correlations were confirmed by decoupling experiments. Partial constitution I, which fits these data, recognizes also the fact that, with the sole exception of the furan oxygen, all oxy-functions ofdiasin are part of carboxy groups.Partial constitution f was confirmed by catalytic hydrogenolysis to a hexahydroderivative (partial con-* Part 3 in the series "The Chemistry of Brazilian Euphorbiaceae".For Part 2 see Ref. Signal multiplicity (ddd) of a further oxymethine (6 4.86) ofdiasin revealed its vicinality to 3 hydrogens: one (6 3.1, d) on carbon 1 to a carbonyl and to a fully substituted position and two represented by signals included in the band envelope around 2 ppm. These correlations were again confirmed by decoupling experiments and led to partial constitution 3. Since the PMR spectrum indicates that diasin contains only one hydrogen on a carbon vi&al to a carbonyl, and this has already been accounted for, the carbons linked to the terminal carbonyl in 3, as well as in the carbomethoxyl(6 3.8, s) (4) of diasin must be quaternary. PMR evidence points additionally to the presence of a quaternary methyl (6 1.16, s) (5).Partial constitutions 1, 3, 4 and 5 show a total of 4 carboxyls and 6 quatemary carbons and must thus share one carboxyl and 3 quaternary carbons. Indeed, according, to CMR evidence (Table Ij, besides the substituted furan position, only 2 quaternary carbons exist in the molecule. The sole combinations of 1, 3, 4 and 5 respecting this requirement are 6 and 7 which define relative positions of all atoms of diasin, except for 2 methina and 3 methylenes evidenced by CMR.The constitution of a rearranged labdanic diterpene can thus be proposed for diasin. The relative configurational details shown in its formula (8a) were deduced as follows.Alkaline hydrolysis of diasin (8a) and remethylation of the reaction product led to isodiasin (8b). The reaction was accompanied by two PMR changes: a,,_, 4.86 (ddd) -+ 4.86 (dd) and S, _ s 3.1 (d) + 2.55 (s). Absence of H-7 H-8 coupling in 8b requires the H-C(7)-C(8hH dihedral angle to be close to 90", i.e. the trans-attachment of the &lactone to the decalin system. In consequence, the BC  which is paralleled by the shift observed in the epimerization of columbin (9a) into isocolumbin (9b) [3]. The furan substituent of the d-lactone in diasin is equatorial, information derived from the coupling constant which characterizes the H-l 1 axial, H-12 intcraction (J 12 Hz) and shows also the latter hydrogen to be axial.While the stereochemistry of the lactone is a consequence of the stated facts, configurational analysis of all other chiral centers necessitated assignment and interpretation of CMR data.The carbon spectrum contains 3 carbonyl peaks at 177.9, 168. If these two rings were trans-fused, the C-3 resonance would appear at ca 37 ppm [4, lo]. In diasin @a), however, the lowest-field yet unassigned methylene signal appears at 29Sppm, indicating that ring A is axially substituted by C-6 and, therefore, that the two rings are cis-fused.An examination of molecular models indicates that, in the above configuration, ring B of diasin. constrained to a boat form, is flanked by rings A and C, which most probably assume the chair conformation.This being the case, the two bridgehead methines, while having the same number of fi effects, are exposed to a different number of y interactions-one (due to one of the oxygens of the ester function) in the case of C-5, and 3 (due to C-12, C-17 and C-18) in the case ofC-10. Thus, the latter carbon absorbs at a higher field. dihedral angle. Due to the reciprocity of this y effect, carbon 20 is also strongly shielded relative to a typical y-lactone carbonyl [5]. Finally, the shift of C-2 is very similar in diasin and in IO-methylated diterpenes [lo], in spite of the fact that two 7 effects act upon C-2 in these models.Since only one y effect is felt by C-Z of diasin, the interaction between carbons 2 and 18 is stronger here than expected, an observation confirmed by the absorp tion of C-18 at an unusually high-field. In the lOmethylated trans-fused diterpenes [lo], the action of the 0 same number of y substituents results in a C-18 shift at 16.1 ppm, as compared to 13.7 ppm in diasin. Taken together CMR data convey the impression that diasin is a highly compact molecule in which strong steric interactions prevail.Although columbin (9a) is an additional example, AB cis-fused diterpenoids such as diasin @a) seem to be extremely rare in nature. In the present case, this configuration can be rationalized, considering the rearranged labdanic cation 10 and the derived cyclopropane lla and cyclopropanol Ilb as biogenetic intermediates.Indeed, the Euphorbiaceae are known for the presence of hydroxylated cyclopropane derivatives [12]. Opening of cyclopropanols with inversion of configuration is known to occur in vitro [14]. Such a reaction would lead to cis-fused AR rings and an oxygenated C-19, as observed in diasin (8a).

In substitution appeared a 4 proton multiplet around 3.7 and a broad band at 6.1 which could be eliminated by addition of D,O. Corresponding changes in the IR spectrum concerned the disappearance of the furan bands and the appearance of the typical broad CO,H-band around 32OOcm-'.

0 and 171.1 ppm, assigned respectively to C-19 in analogy to a slmdar terpenoid 141, the b-lactone [5--71 and the p-lactone by defautt. The 4 additional sp2 carbon signals can be assigned to the furan moiety, taking into consideration their multiplicity and the shielding caused on carbons 14 and 16 by the p-substituent [5.8]. Three of the sp3 carbons, a methyl and 2 methines, are oxygenated. Of the last two, the signal at 71.3 ppm is assigned to C-12 by analogy to similar diterpene furanolactones [8, 93. The remaining tetrahedral carbons are attributed by signal multiplicity considerations to one methyl, 5 methylenes, 3 methines and 2 quaternary centers. By analogy to other 4-methyl-4-carboxy terp encs, C-4 corresponds to the singlet at 45.2 ppm [4, IO], while the other quaternary carbon. C-9 must thus be represented by the singlet at 34.2 ppm. The third carbon a to a carbonyl group is a methine which can be recognixed by its larger residual splitting in the singlefrequency off-resonance decoupled (sford) spectrum, with the decoupling frequency set at the high-field end of the proton range. The methylene signal at lowest field can be attributed only to C-l 1 in view of its sharpness in the sford spectrum (i.e. the absence of second order coupling [I I]) and in analogy to a similar system [9]. The remaining 2 methine and 4 methylenc signals appear very broadened in the sford spectrum and belong therefore to the strongly proton-coupled chain encompassing carbons 3,2,I.10,5 and 6. Their complete assignment is only possible through the stereochemical arguments that follow. The configurational problems yet to be solved concern the stereochemistries of C-4 and the AB ring junction. The very high field resonance of the corresponding signal indicates the axial nature of the C4 methyl group [lo]. The chemical shift of C-3 is a good probe ofthe AB ring junction stereochemistry.
Furthermore, C-6 is axial to ring A, and is shielded by 7 interactions with carbons 1 and 3, in addition to C-19. The only two yet unassigned signals arc almost coincident and correspond to C-l and C-2. In cis-decalin, the former carbon absorbs at 29.8 ppm [IZ]. The strong shielding of C-l in diasin relative to this model reflects the very small C(l)-C(lOkC(9)-C(20)
