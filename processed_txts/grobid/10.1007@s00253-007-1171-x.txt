Endophytic fungi as models for the stereoselective biotransformation of thioridazine
The stereoselective kinetic biotransformation of thioridazine, a phenothiazine neuroleptic drug, by endophytic fungi was investigated. In general, the sulfur of lateral chain (position 2) or the sulfur of phenothiazinic ring (position 5) were oxidated yielding the major human metabolites thioridazine-2-sulfoxide and thioridazine-5-sulfoxide. The quantity of metabolites biosynthesized varied among the 12 endophytic fungi evaluated. However, mono-2-sulfoxidation occurred in higher ratio and frequency. Among the 12 fungi evaluated, 4 of them deserve prominence for presenting an evidenced stereoselective biotransformation: Phomopsis sp. (TD2), Glomerella cingulata (VA1), Diaporthe phaseolorum (VR4), and Aspergillus fumigatus (VR12). Both enantiomers of thioridazine were consumed by the fungi; however, the 2-sulfoxidation yielded preferentially the R configuration at the sulfur atom.

IntroductionBiotransformation can be defined as the use of biological systems to produce chemical changes on compounds that are not their natural substrates. Biotransformations have many advantages when compared to the corresponding chemical methods. The conditions for such processes are mild and usually do not require the protection of other functional groups. In many cases, biotransformations are stereoselective, allowing the production of enantiomerically pure compounds. Thus, the features governing their regiospecificity differ from those controlling chemical specificity, and indeed, it is possible to obtain biotransformations at centers that are chemically unreactive. Some biotransformations are cheaper and more direct than their chemical analogues. In addition, the reactions normally occur under ecologically acceptable conditions (Aleu and Collado 2001). Isolated enzyme systems or intact whole organisms (fungi, bacteria, and yeasts) may be used for biotransformations (Aleu and Collado 2001;García-Granados et al. 2004). The use of microorganisms is advantageous because they present fast growth and easy formation of the multienzymatic system. Further, in many cases, the biological transformations are enantioselective, allowing the production of chiral compounds from racemic mixtures.One crucial aspect to be considered for a successful microbial biotransformation is the selection of the natural source to be studied. Endophytic fungi are an unexplored or at least under-explored source for microbial biotransformation. The term endophytic fungus has been employed to describe those fungi that can be detected at a particular moment within the tissues of apparently healthy plant host. The colonization can be inter-or intracellular, localized or systemic (Schulz and Boyle 2005). Therefore, we are involved in a project to study the stereoselective biotrans-formation of drugs by endophytic fungi. The results presented in this paper were obtained using thioridazine (THD) as drug model.THD, a phenothiazine neuroleptic drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, is commercially available and also administered as a racemic mixture of the enantiomers (-)-(S) and (+)-(R). Its stereochemistry is important because it is believed that the antipsychotic effect of racemic THD is mainly associated with (R)-THD (Eap et al. 1995). Through S-oxidation in the position 2, THD is transformed to thioridazine-2-sulfoxide (THD-2-SO), which undergoes subsequent oxidation to sulfone (thioridazine-2-sulfone, THD-2-SO 2 ;Axelsson 1977;Bylund 1981;Richelson and Nelson 1984). THD-2-SO and THD-2-SO 2 are metabolites considered pharmacologically active. Another metabolite, thioridazine-5-sulfoxide (THD-5-SO), formed by S-oxidation in the thiazine ring position 5, contributes to the cardiotoxicity of the drug (Gottschalk et al. 1978;Hale and Poklis 1986).The aim of this study was to study the stereoselective kinetic biotransformation of THD by some endophytic fungi.
Materials and methods
Endophytic fungiThe microorganisms used in this study were previously isolated as endophytes from the plants Tithonia diversifolia, Viguiera arenaria, and Viguiera robusta (Asteraceae). The selected strains were Phomopsis sp. (TD2) and Cercospora kikuchii (TD4), both isolated from Tithonia diversifolia; Glomerella cingulata (VA1), Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (VA2), Phomopsis amygdali (VA14), Guignardia mangiferae (VA15), Phomopsis longicolla (VA19), Penicillium ochrochloron (VA20), isolated from Viguiera arenaria; Diaporthe phaseolorum (VR4), Penicillium brevicompactum (VR5), Pestalotiopsis foedans (VR8) and Aspergillus fumigatus (VR12) isolated from Viguiera robusta. All the fungi were identified by rDNA sequence (data not shown). Cultures of endophytes have been maintained on potato dextrose agar slants and stored at 4°C. The strains have been deposited in the Academic Laboratory of Industrial Enzimology of Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeirão Preto (University de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil).
Biotransformation reactions, extraction procedure, and chromatographic analysisThe fungi were cultured using a two-step process. First, mycelial suspension was aseptically inoculated into 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 25 ml of seed medium (Jackson et al. 1993). The flasks were incubated for 48 h at 30°C on a rotary shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, model Innova ™ 4300, New Jersey, USA) operating at 120 rpm (preculture). Second, the resulting mycelia were harvested, rinsed, and transferred into 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of Czapek medium (Alviano et al. 1992) adjusted to pH 5.0. THD (1 mg dissolved in 100 μl of N,N-dimethylformamide) was added to each flask. Control flasks consisted of culture broth without THD and fungi, only sterile medium with N,N-dimethylformamide, sterile medium with N,N-dimethylformamide and THD, sterile medium with N,N-dimethylformamide, and endophytic fungal mycelium (each endophytic fungus studied). Biotransformation experiments were carried out at 30°C, with shaking at 120 rpm for 144 h in light absence. The aliquots of filtrate (1 ml) were collected, each 24 h, and alkalinized with 200 μl of 4 mol l -1 sodium hydroxide solution and extracted with 3 mL diethyl ether. The tubes were capped and submitted to vortex mixing for 2 min and then centrifuged at 1,800×g for 5 min. The upper organic phases (2 ml) were transferred to conical tubes and evaporated under nitrogen. The residues were dissolved in 100 μl of the mobile phase, and 50 μl were analyzed by a validated chiral high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (Borges et al. 2007).Briefly, the analyses were carried out using a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) HPLC system, consisting of a LC 10 AS model solvent pump, a Rheodyne model 7125 injector with a 50 μl loop, a SPD-10 A UV-Vis detector operating at 262 nm, and a CR6-A model integrator. The simultaneous resolution of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO stereoisomers was performed on a CHIRALPAK® AS column (250×4.6 mm, ID, 10 μm particle size, Chiral Technologies, Exton, USA), protected with a 4×4 mm RP-8 endcapped guard column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), using a mobile phase consisting of hexane/ethanol/methanol (92:6:2, v/v/v) and 0.5% diethylamine at a flow rate of 1.4 ml min -1 . The analyses were carried out in an acclimatized room with the temperature set at 23 (±2)°C. Elution order of THD-2-SO stereoisomers was based on Choi et al. (2004). THD-5-SO exists as two diastereoisomeric pairs, referred to fast-eluting (FE) THD-5-SO and slow-eluting (SE) THD-5-SO based on their chromatography properties (Eap et al. 1995;Eap et al. 1996). The absolute configuration at the S center of THD-5-SO is under evaluation by our group.
Results and discussionThe culture and biotransformation conditions used in this work were defined in preliminary studies (Borges et al. 2007). These conditions were maintained to study the stereoselective biotransformation potential of the endophytic fungi. Under the described conditions, within 144 h of incubation of all endophytic fungi selected, the THD metabolites were detected in the medium culture of 11 fungi; only the fungus Guignardia mangiferae (VA15) was not effective for the biotransformation of THD. Among the fungi able to biotransform THD, four of them deserve prominence for presenting an evidenced stereoselective biotransformation: Phomopsis sp. (TD2), Glomerella cingulata (VA1), Diaporthe phaseolorum (VR4), and Aspergillus fumigatus (VR12).Endophytic fungi were very efficient in stereoselectively biotransform rac-thioridazine into the major metabolites THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO. The quantity of metabolites biosynthesized varied among the 12 endophytic fungi evaluated. In general, the sulfur of the side chain (position 2) or the sulfur of phenothiazinic ring (position 5) were oxidated (Fig. 1), however, mono-2-sulfoxidation occurred in higher ratio and frequency. In humans, sulfoxide drugs and metabolites, such as thioridazine, thioridazine-2sulfoxide, and thioridazine-5-sulfoxide, can undergo further oxidation to sulfone (thioridazine-2-sulfone and thioridazine-5-sulfone; Gruenke et al. 1975;Zehnder et al. 1962). The THD-2-SO 2 was also detected in the culture media of Glomerella cingulata (VA1), Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (VA2), Diaporthe phaseolorum (VR4), and Penicillium brevicompactum (VR5).The kinetic studies were carried out for all the fungi but the concentration-time profiles were presented only for the fungi that demonstrated higher biotransformation potential. The data are shown in Fig. 2. Further information could be seem on Table 1 that describes the maximal percentage of formed metabolites for each fungi evaluated in the study and the time required to reach this concentration. The calculations were performed assuming that THD used in the biotransformation experiments was a racemic mixture (50% of each enantiomer). (R)-THD can form (R,R)-THD-2-SO or/and (R,S)-THD-2-SO metabolites and also (R)-THD-5-SO (SE) or/and (R)-THD-5-SO (FE) metabolites. In addition, (S)-THD can form (S,S)-THD-2-SO or/and (S, R)-THD-2-SO metabolites and also (S)-THD-5-SO (SE) or/ and (S)-THD-5-SO (FE) metabolites.
Phomopsis sp. (TD2)The fungus Phomopsis sp. (TD2) biotransforms stereoselectively the THD in both studied metabolites. This fungus biotransforms (S)-THD in a slightly higher little bit proportion than (R)-THD. When the fungus uses (S)-THD for biotransformation, the 2-sulfoxidation preferentially occurs (approximately four times) at R configuration of the sulfur atom to form (S,R)-THD-2-SO in a higher amount. In addition, when the fungus uses the (R)-THD, there is also a preference (approximately three times) by 2- sulfoxidation at R configuration. The (R,R)-THD-2-SO metabolite was formed in higher amount than (R,S)-THD-2-SO. Thus, the 2-sulfoxidation of THD by Phomopsis sp. (TD2) is preferentially done yielding the R metabolite.The THD-5-SO metabolite was also formed from (S)and (R)-THD (dotted line in Fig. 2a). The formation of this metabolite was shown to be similar for all stereoisomers. Among these stereoisomers, the (S)-THD-5-SO (FE) + (R)-THD-5-SO (SE) metabolites presented higher formation (13.2%) on the third day. Among all the 12 fungi studied, Phomopsis sp. (TD2) was the most efficient in the production of this metabolite (Table 1). Unfortunately, the absolute configuration of these metabolites has not been established yet.
Glomerella cingulata (VA1)In the same way, the fungus Glomerella cingulata (VA1) stereoselectively biotransformed the THD into THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO metabolites. In contrast of Phomopsis sp. (TD2), Glomerella cingulata (VA1) used the (R)-THD in higher amount in the biotransformation process. The 2sulfoxidation of (S)-or (R)-THD also occurred resulting preferentially the R configuration of the sulfoxide metabolite.This fungus used both the (S)-THD or (R)-THD to biotransform THD into THD-5-SO. Glomerella cingulata (VA1) presented an interesting differential because it formed high amounts of (S)-THD-5-SO (FE) + (R)-THD-5-SO (SE) metabolites. The other THD-5-SO metabolites were formed in low amount (Fig. 2b).
Diaporthe phaseolorum (VR4)Diaporthe phaseolorum (VR4) biotransformed (S)-and (R)-THD in proportional amounts. This fungus showed appreciable formation of THD-2-SO metabolite (approximately 80% formation of drug added). The 2-sulfoxidation occurred with higher preference resulting in the R configuration of the sulfoxide to form (S,R)-THD-2-SO and (R, R)-THD-2-SO. The sulfoxidation at position 5 in the phenothiazinic ring occurred with low intensity (Fig. 2c).
Aspergillus fumigatus (VR12)The maximal formation of metabolites by Aspergillus fumigatus (VR12) was observed within 48 h of incubation. Next, the concentrations of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO metabolites start decreasing because both metabolites were also used as substrate by the fungi. The compounds formed in this process were not detected by our analytical procedure.This fungus used (S)-and (R)-THD to form their sulfoxide metabolites. The formation of THD-2-SO metab-  b The negative controls showed no formation of species in study. c Fungus that presented higher percentage formation for (S)-THD-5-SO (SE) metabolite. d Fungus that presented higher percentage formation for (R)-THD-5-SO (FE) metabolite. e Fungus that presented higher percentage formation for (R)-THD-5-SO (SE) + (S)-THD-5-SO (FE) metabolite.f Fungus that presented higher percentage formation for (S,R)-THD-2-SO metabolite.g Fungus that presented higher percentage formation for (R,R)-THD-2-SO metabolite. h Fungus that presented higher percentage formation for (S,S)-THD-2-SO metabolite.i Fungus that presented higher percentage formation for (R,S)-THD-2-SO metabolite.olite was higher than the formation of THD-5-SO metabolite. Among all fungi evaluated, Aspergillus fumigatus (VR12) showed higher formation of (S,S)-THD-2-SO and (R,R)-THD-2-SO metabolites (Table 1). The 5-sulfoxidation in the thiazine ring occurred also with low intensity (dotted trace in Fig. 2d).In conclusion, the obtained data showed that these microorganisms biotransform THD trough sulfoxidation in position 2 of the thiomethyl substituent and sulfoxidation in position 5 in the phenothiazinic ring as the main oxidation pathways. In humans, THD is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are the main enzymes responsible for 5-sulfoxidation and Ndemethylation (34-52%), while CYP2D6 catalyzes mono-2-and di-2-sulfoxidation (49 and 64%, respectively; Wójcikowski et al. 2006). Our results showed that, by selecting the appropriate fungi species, it will be possible to mimetic CYP1A2/ CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 metabolism of THD; the specific metabolite could be produced and isolated from culture medium by semi-preparative or preparative chromatography. The ability of these microorganisms to biomimic mammalian metabolism, to perform biotransformation reactions, and to produce high amounts of drug metabolites suggest that this microbial system represents a suitable alternative for drug biotransformation studies.Fig. 11Fig.1Stereoselective biotransformation of thioridazine that undergo oxidation at sulfur atom (phase I reaction)
