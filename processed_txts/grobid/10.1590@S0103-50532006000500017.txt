Novel Anthraquinone Derivatives Produced by Phoma sorghina, an Endophyte Found in Association with the Medicinal Plant Tithonia diversifolia (Asteraceae)
Três antraquinonas conhecidas (1,7-diidroxi-3-metil-9,10-antraquinona, 1,6-diidroxi-3-metil-9,10-antraquinona e 1-hidroxi-3-metil-9,10-antraquinona), uma nova antraquinona (1,7-diidroxi-3-hidroximetil-9,10-antraquinona), e dois novos derivados hexaidroantraquinônicos, dendrióis E e F, foram isolados da cultura do fungo endofítico Phoma sorghina, associado a Tithonia diversifolia (Asteraceae). Suas estruturas foram identificadas com base em dados espectroscópicos, principalmente RMN 1D e 2D.Three known anthraquinones (1,7-dihydroxy-3-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone, 1,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone and 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone), one new anthraquinone (1,7-dihydroxy-3-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone), and two new hexahydroanthraquinone derivatives, dendryols E and F, were isolated from the culture of the endophytic fungus Phoma sorghina, found in association with Tithonia diversifolia (Asteraceae). Their structures were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data, mainly 1D and 2D NMR.

IntroductionEndophytes are considered outstanding and under explored sources of novel chemical diversity and bioactive compounds. 1,2 These microorganisms can be detected at a particular moment within the tissues of apparently healthy plant hosts, 3 and they have been found in all plant species examined to date. 4 As they occupy unique biological niches, 5,6 the complex web of interactions with other endophytes and with the host might give rise to new chemical diversity and bioactive compounds. 1 In fact, this prolific biosynthetic capability is illustrated by a number of new and/or bioactive metabolites isolated from endophytes. 2,6 Most of the researches on the chemistry of endophytes have been done in the northern hemisphere. However, results have shown that tropical plants present greater diversity of endophytes species than those from temperate zones. 3 In Brazil, research on endophytes has also led to new and bioactive compounds. [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] We have been interested in endophytes found in association with Tithonia diversifolia (Asteraceae), also known as Mexican sunflower. T. diversifolia fulfils the rationale for plant selection with the aim to isolate endophytes, 2 since extracts of this plant have been used traditionally in the treatment of malaria, diarrhea, fever, hepatitis and wounds. [14][15][16] Anti-inflammatory, amoebicidal, antispasmodic, antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral activities have also been described for T. diversifolia extracts. 15,16 Moreover, there are no previous reports on the isolation and cultivation of endophytes from T. diversifolia.In this work Phoma sorghina was isolated as an endophytic fungus from the leaves of T. diversifolia. After cultivation on solid rice medium, three known and three novel anthraquinone derivatives were isolated and identified.
Experimental
General experimental proceduresOptical rotations were measured on a PERKIN ELMER 241 polarimeter. UV spectra were obtained in MeOH solution on a SHIMADZU PC 1520 diode array spectrophotometer and IR spectra were measured with a Nicole Protégé 460 spectrophotometer. High-resolution ESI-MS were measured with an UltrO-TOF (Bruker-daltonics, Billarica, USA). Lowresolution ESI-MS data were acquired in the negative ion mode, using a MICROMASS QUATTRO-LC instrument equipped with an ESI/APCI "Z-spray" ion source. Semi preparative HPLC separations were carried out in a Shimadzu (LC-6AD apparatus, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD-M10Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection and processing (software Class-VP), using VP 250/ 10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C18 or VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 100-5 C18 columns. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopic experiments were recorded on BRUKER DRX-400 and BRUKER DRX-500 spectrometers with CD 3 OD and CDCl 3 as solvents and TMS as internal standard.
MicroorganismThe general procedures adopted for isolation of the microorganism followed the methodology described by Kongsaeree et al. 17 After collected, healthy leaves of Tithonia diversifolia were washed with water and surface sterilized by immersion in 70% aqueous ethanol (2 minutes), followed by 5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (90 seconds), and finally with 70% aqueous ethanol (1 minute). After these procedures, the leaves were rinsed with sterilized water. This latter water was incubated in Petri dishes to guarantee the elimination of all epiphytic microorganisms. Small pieces of the leaves were excised and placed on agar in Petri dishes containing PDA medium at 30 ºC. Individual hyphal tips of the emerging fungi were removed and replaced on PDA.The TD5 strain was identified as Phoma sorghina by "Fundação Tropical de Pesquisa André Tosello". A voucher specimen has been deposited at "Laboratório de Enzimologia Industrial", FCFRP, USP. The strain is maintained by periodic transfers onto PDA 18 at 4 ºC, and also in silica gel (6-12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated) at 10 ºC.Rice culture of Phoma sorghina and isolation of the anthraquinones P. sorghina was cultured on sterilized rice according to previously described procedures. 10,13 Fifteen Erlenmeyer flasks (2 L) containing rice (360 g per flask) ("Uncle Ben's"parboiled) and distilled water (300 mL per flask) were autoclaved twice at 121 ºC for 40 min. Four small disks of PDA medium from the Petri dish containing mycelium of Phoma sorghina were transferred under sterile conditions to 14 of the 15 Erlenmeyer's flasks containing sterilized rice. One flask was kept for control purpose. After 30 days of growth at 30 ºC, MeOH (600 mL) was added to each flask for 6 h. The solution was filtered and MeOH was removed under vacuum to give the MeOH extract as an orange residue (126.8 g). The MeOH extract was suspended in MeOH:H 2 O 1:3 and partitioned with CH 2 Cl 2 , EtOAc, and n-BuOH. The CH 2 Cl 2 fraction was further partitioned with hexane and MeOH. The hexane sub fraction (585.2 mg) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) over silica gel 60H using hexane:EtOAc gradient elution, affording 14 sub fractions. Sub fraction 7 (40.0 mg), obtained from hexane:EtOAc 1:1 elution, was further purified through 3 times elution on preparative TLC (hexane:EtOAc 9:1). Sub fraction 7.5 (R f 0.74, 1.8 mg) was submitted to semi preparative reversedphase HPLC (VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C18, 70% MeCN in H 2 O, flow rate 3.0 mL min -1 , 253 nm) to yield 3 (  2. 13 C NMR: Table 3.   
Results and DiscussionThe MeOH extract obtained from the cultivation of Phoma sorghina, after chromatographic procedures, afforded three orange (1,2,4), one yellow (3) and two compounds (5-6) (Figure 1).Compounds 1-3 exhibited typical UV, IR, NMR and MS data of hydroxyanthraquinones. Their physical data are in agreement with those previously reported for 1,7dihydroxy-3-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone (1), 19 1,6dihydroxy-3-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone (phomarin, 2), 20,21 and 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone (pachybasin, 3). 22 Although these anthraquinones have already been isolated, only 3 has its 13 C NMR data published. For compounds 1 and 2 there are no previous 13 C NMR data reported. HMQC and HMBC experiments allowed us to assign the hydrogens and carbons for both compounds (Tables 1 and3).The molecular formula of compound 4 was established as C 15 H 10 O 5 by HRESIMS, as well as 1 H and 13 C NMR data. The IR spectrum of the compound 4 showed characteristic absorption bands from OH (broad, 3442 cm -1 ) and α,β-unsaturated ketone (1638 cm -1 ). The 13 C NMR spectrum of 4 (Table 2) showed 13 carbon signals (two carbons were not observed): 2 carbonyls (δ 190.6 and δ 182.6), five quaternary sp 2 carbons, five methine aromatic carbons, and one sp 3 methylene group. The 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed a singlet at δ 8.54, assigned to a hydroxyl group H-bonded to a carbonyl, and two metacoupled aromatic hydrogens at δ 7.21 (d, J 0.6 Hz, H-2) and δ 7.69 (d, J 0.6 Hz, H-4), suggesting a 1,2,3,5tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The presence of a 1,2,4trisubstituted aromatic ring was evident from the signals at δ 6.90 (dd, J 8.6 and 2.5 Hz, H-6), δ 7.43 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-8) and δ 8.02 (d, J 8.6 Hz, H-5). The position of hydroxyl group at C-7 was unequivocally ascribed by HMBC correlations and splitting patterns of the 1 H NMR signals. Both hydrogens at δ 7.69 (H-4) and δ 8.02 (H-5) showed long range correlations with the carbon at δ 182.6, establishing this ketone at C-10. H-5 was found to be orto coupled to H-6, suggesting a substitution at C-7. The remaining ketone group was attributed to C-9, which presented long range correlation in the HMBC experiment with the hydrogen at δ 7.43 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-8). The meta coupling observed for H-8 is also only possible if the hydroxyl group is located at C-7. The typical signal for the methyl group attached to C-3 in anthraquinones was not observed. However, the cross peak in the HMQC between the hydrogens at δ 4.68 (s, 2H) and the carbon at δ 64.4 suggested a hydroxymethyl group at C-3. The HMBC and HMQC data confirmed the location of the hydroxymethyl group at C-3 through the observed correlations amongst H-11 and C-2, C-3 and C-4.The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of compounds 5 and 6 also showed the signals related to the aromatic ring bearing hydroxyl and methyl groups, typical of the anthraquinones (Tables 2 and3). However, they did reveal only one signal of ketone carbonyl, and no signals of the additional aromatic ring. The 1 H NMR spectra revealed signals at δ 1.19-2.48 and δ 3.40-5.35, suggesting the presence of hexahydroanthraquinone frameworks. Similar compounds were previously isolated from the pathogenic fungus Dendryphiella sp., and were named dendryols. 23 Compound 5 was obtained as a pale yellow amorphous solid. From its HRESIMS, as well as by the observed signals in the NMR spectra, it was possible to deduce its molecular formula as C 15 H 18 O 4 . The 1 H NMR, DEPT, HMBC and HMQC spectra revealed the presence of one methyl, three methylene, six methine, five quaternary carbons and three hydroxyl groups. COSY, HMBC and NOE experiments, and also J values, allowed us to unequivocally ascribe all the protons and carbons of the molecule, as well as the relative stereochemistries of the stereogenic carbons. Hydroxyl methine protons were observed at δ 3.63 (m) and δ 4.80 (d, J 9.8 Hz). In contrast with 9,10-anthraquinones 1-4, only one ketone carbonyl signal (δ 200.0) was observed in the HMBC experiment. The cross peak between the ketone carbon and the proton at δ 7.26 (br s, H-4), observed in the HMBC experiment, led us to locate the ketone at C-10. So, it was suggested that one hydroxyl group should be placed at C-9. Moreover, both deshielded chemical shifts for H-9 (δ 4.80) and C-9 (δ 73.8) suggested a benzylic position. Hydrogens H-9 (δ 4.80) and H-8a (δ 1.75) are coupled in a trans relationship, as suggested by the J value of 9.8 Hz. The stereochemistry of an analogue structure, dendryol A, has been established through X-ray diffraction analysis. 23 So, we assumed the same relative configuration at C-9 for compound 5.

The sub fraction 4 (81.6 mg) was submitted to a silica gel column chromatography using CHCl 3 :MeOH 9:1, 1:1 and MeOH as mobile phase, affording 7 fractions. The sub fraction 4.4 (19.2 mg) was submitted to semi preparative reversed-phase HPLC (VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C18, 50% MeOH in H 2 O, flow rate 3.0 mL min -1 , 222 nm) to yield 5 (1.3 mg; R t 16.5 min) and 6 (1.5 mg; R t 17.8 min). After preparative TLC (MeOH:CHCl 3 1:9), the sub fraction 6 (11.7 mg) yielded 5 fractions.13 C NMR: Table3.The sub fraction
