Lipophyllic antioxidants from Iryanthera juruensis fruits
The phytochemical investigation of the hexane extract of Iryanthera juruensis (Myristicaceae) fruits led to the isolation of two tocotrienols and four lignans which exhibited antioxidant activity towards b-carotene on TLC autographic assay. Two inactive quinones and three o-arylalkanoic acids were also isolated. The isolates were investigated for their redox properties using cyclic voltammetry. The structure elucidation of the new compounds (one tocotrienol, one quinone and three o-arylalkanoic acids) was based on analysis of spectroscopic data.

IntroductionIryanthera juruensis is a widespread Amazonian species known as ucu-uÂ ba, which means fat-producing tree, this being a general designation given to myristicaceous species. Their seeds are valued in Brazil for their high yields of fatty acids, mainly myristic acid (C-14), which is extensively used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Other Iryanthera species were reported to have their crushed leaves used by Amazon indians for healing seriously infected wounds and cuts and to have their latex from the barks mixed with warm water for treating stomache infections (Schultes and Holmstedt, 1971). In the course of our systematic studies on Iryanthera, we have demonstrated the presence of tocotrienols with higher antioxidant activity than a-tocopherol in fruits of I. grandis and I. lancifolia, evaluated through malondialdehyde (MDA) and chemiluminescence (CL) assays (Barros et al., 1993) and of antioxidant dihydrochalcones and ¯avonolignans in I. lancifolia (Silva et al., 1999). Studies on tocotrienol biological activities revealed the ability of a-and g-tocotrienol in inhibiting solid tumour growth of sarcoma 180 and also the highly metastic Lewis lung carcinoma cells (Komiyama et al., 1992). Moreover, these tocotrienols are eective against vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, which plays a central role in atherosclerosis (Azzi et al., 1992). Oxidative damage to cell components is the initial event in several human disease processes including cancer and atherosclerosis (Gordon, 1996), and this has intensi®ed the search for natural antioxidants. The antioxidant activity of a compound depends ultimately on its ease of oxidation and, for a variety of natural or synthetic compounds, good correlations have been observed between antioxidant activities and low oxidation potentials (Born et al., 1996). In this work we report on the isolation of antioxidant compounds of I. juruensis fruits guided by the b-carotene TLC assay (Pratt and Miller, 1984) and the evaluation of their oxidation potentials through cyclic voltammetry. Further examination of the lipophyllic constituents led to isolation of inactive compounds, which were also investigated electrochemically.
Results and discussionDried and powdered fruits were extracted with hexane. Fractionation of the crude extract guided by the antioxidant TLC assay aorded 1, 2 and 6±9. In addition, inactive metabolites 3, 4 and 5a±c were isolated (see Experimental).The structural determination of compounds 1 and 2 was based on analysis of their NMR and MS spectra as well as on comparison with literature data for similar 0031-9422/01/$ -see front matter # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. P I I : S 0123456789www.elsevier.com/locate/phytochem compounds (Vieira et al., 1983a). The 1 H NMR spectra of compounds 1 and 2 showed two doublets at 5.47AE0.02 (d, J=9.7AE0.1 Hz) and 6.17AE0.02 (d, J=9.7AE0.1 Hz) assigned to H-3 and H-4, respectively, typical of the chromene ring of C-3 unsaturated tocotrienols, which had only been found previously in brown seaweeds from genera Sargassum and Stypopodium (Kusumi et al., 1979;Gerwick and Fenical, 1981). The other spectral features are similar to those of C-3 saturated tocotrienols; therefore, 1 H and 13 C NMR data could be assigned by comparison with d-tocotrienol and 17-carboxy-d-tocotrienol, previously isolated from pericarps of I. lancifolia and fruits of I. grandis (Vieira et al., 1983b;Lopes et al., 1998). Tocotrienol 2 was identi®ed as sargachromenol, originally isolated from Sargassum serratifolium (Kusumi et al., 1979). The new tocotrienol 1 diers from 2 by one additional methyl group on the chromene ring (C-7); its only aromatic proton was placed at C-5 after observation of NOE interactions between H-5 and H-4. Further NOE observations, COSY and DEPT as well as ESMS data led to elucidation of 1 as 2,7,8-trimethyl-2-[(3E,7Z)-4,12-dimethyl-8-carboxyl-3,7,11-tridecatrienyl]-3-chromen-6-ol for which we propose the name 7-methyl-sargachromenol.The 13 C NMR spectra of 3 and 4 showed two signals at 187.7 AE 0.2 and 187.9 AE 0.1 for two ketone groups conjugated to sp 2 carbons, which were assigned, respectively, to C-1 and C-4 of the quinone ring. DEPT 135 experiments indicated the presence of six methyl groups in compound 3 and ®ve methyl groups in 4. The 1 H NMR spectra of 3 and 4 showed one doublet at 3.05 (J=7. 1 Hz) integrating for two hydrogens on a sp 3 carbon linked to two sp 2 carbons. The 1 H± 1 H NMR spectrum showed the correlation of this signal with the multiplet centered at 5 and the signal at 6.39, assigned to H-2 H and H-3, respectively, and con®rms the placement of the only quinone ring hydrogen of compound 3 on C-3. The additional methyl group of compound 3 was then placed at C-5. The remaining spectral data were consistent with the proposed structures, including the placement of a carboxyl group on the isoprenic chain, determined through MS data (Fig. 1). The structure of this new quinone, named as 3-methyl-sargaquinoic acid, was established as 2, 3-dimethyl-6-[(2E,6E,10Z)-3,7,15-trimethyl-11-carboxyl-2,6,10,14-hexadecatetraenyl]-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione. Compound 4, which was identi®ed as sargaquinoic acid after comparison of its NMR spectrum and MS pro®le with literature data, was originally isolated from the brown algae Sargassum serratifolium (Kusumi et al., 1979) and diers from 3 only concerning the quinone ring substitution pattern. The new compounds 1 and 3 follow the g-tocotrienol pattern, while the known 2 and 4 follow the d-tocotrienol substitution pattern.Compounds 5a±c were identi®ed as o-arylalkanoic acids based on a broad singlet at 1.18 of a methylene chain and the absence of a terminal methyl group, (ca. 0.8, t) in the 1 H NMR spectrum, associated to the signal at 179.4 on the 13 C NMR spectrum and the presence of an aromatic ring. The substitution pattern of this ring, linked to the methylene chain, was de®ned through observation of two doublets at 6.61 (J=1.6 Hz) and 6.66 (J=7.7 Hz) and one doublet of doublets at 6.55 (J=1.6 and 7.7 Hz) in the 1 H NMR spectrum. The presence of a methylenedioxy group was inferred through observation of signals at 5.85 and 100.6 in the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra, respectively. The LC± UV±MS analysis of the mixture of 5a±c evidenced the presence of three substances (R T 15.0, 16.1 and 17.1 min.), which absorbed at l max 284 nm. The ESMS analysis indicated a molecular weight of 362, 390 and 418 for compounds 5a±c, inferred from base peaks at m/z 385, 413 and 441 ([M+Na] + ), respectively. The on-line analysis showed additional peaks at 363, 391 and 419 ([M+1] + ) which con®rmed the length of the methylene chains of these compounds. The o-arylalkanoic acids 5a± c result biogenetically from condensation of substituted dihydrocinnamic acid and lauric, myristic and palmitic acids, respectively. As these o-arylalkanoic acids proved to be new natural products, their isolation was subsequently undertaken. Their EIMS spectra showed base peaks at m/z 135 [C 7 H 5 .CH 2 O 2 ] + , which con®rmed the proposed structures for these compounds. These o-arylalkanoic acids had not been isolated from natural sources yet and are probably the biosynthetic precursors of juruenolides, o-arylalkanoic acids condensed with pyruvic acid followed by g-lactonization, found in the trunk wood of Iryanthera juruensis (Vieira et al., 1983b) and pericarps of Virola surinamensis (Lopes et al., 1998).Lignans 6±9 were identi®ed as epi-guaiacin, guaiacin, verrucosin and nectandrin B, respectively, from their spectroscopic data and comparison with literature (Majunder et al., 1972;Gottlieb et al., 1976;Joshi et al., 1979;Moro et al., 1987;Ward, 1997).Antioxidative properties of compounds 1±9 were evaluated against b-carotene ( Pratt and Miller, 1984). By using b-carotene as a TLC spray reagent, tocotrienols 1 and 2 and lignans 6±9 (10 mg) appeared as yellow spots against a white background, meaning these compounds inhibited the bleaching of b-carotene. The same amounts of quinones 3 and 4 and o-arylalkanoic acids 5a±c were completely inactive.The evaluation of the redox properties of tocotrienols 1 and 2 was carried out electrochemically in order to compare their voltammetric behaviour and to correlate the corresponding oxidation potentials with antioxidant properties of these compounds (Born et al., 1996). Firstly, the electrochemical behaviour was investigated with a-tocopherol being used as reference compound. In addition, taking into consideration that oxidation products of tocopherols and tocotrienols can be electrochemically reduced, the reduction of the oxidized products of tocotrienols 1 and 2, previously generated on the electrode surface after oxidation step were also studied and compared to the voltammetric behaviour of plastoquinones 3 and 4. The cyclic voltammograms of a-tocopherol and tocotrienols 1 and 2 showed oxidation peaks at +0.28, +0.23 and +0.32 V (Table 1) respectively, suggesting a higher antioxidant capacity for tocotrienol 1, when compared to a-tocopherol. The comparison among oxidation potentials of tocotrienols 1 and 2 and a-tocopherol shows that 1 is the most easily oxidizable compound. Alkyl groups meta to the aromatic hydroxyl have little eect on the oxidation ability of phenolic compounds, but inductive eects from either ortho or para alkyl groups may lower the oxidation potential and make the molecule even easier oxidized than the phenol itself (Marcus and Hawley, 1970). This could explain the lower oxidation potential of 1 when compared to 2, as they possess the aromatic substitution pattern of gand d-tocotrienol, respectively. The lower oxidation potential of 1 when compared to a-tocopherol might be due to its C-3 double bond, which is conjugated with the aromatic ring and stabilizes the intermediate cation previous to completion of oxidation steps.The structure±activity relationship indicates, in this case, that the stabilizing eect of the C-3 double bond on the intermediate cation due to the presence of one aromatic methyl group ortho to the hydroxyl (e.g. compound  +0.81 ± a Reduction potentials of the oxidized products of a-tocopherol and tocotrienols 1 and 2, generated on the electrode surface. 1) overcomes, although slightly, the stabilizing eect of two aromatic methyl groups ortho to the hydroxyl, if the C-3 double bond is absent (e.g. a-tocopherol). The contribution of this double bond is, however, not enough to keep up the intermediate cation stability if no methyl group ortho to the hydroxyl group is present in the molecule, as in compound 2. The electrochemical behaviour of quinones 3 and 4 was compared to those of the oxidized products of tocotrienols 1 and 2, respectively. The great similarity observed for the reduction potentials of these oxidation products and tocotrienols 1 and 2 suggests that the products generated after oxidation of tocotrienols 1 and 2 are structurally closely related to quinones 3 and 4, respectively.The high oxidation potential of the o-arylalkanoic acids 5a±c is probably a result of the lack of aromatic hydroxyl groups in these molecules. The absence of oxidation peak in the cyclic voltammograms of 3 and 4 as well as the high value (+1.52) for 5a±c are in agreement with the inactivity observed on the b-carotene assay for these compounds.The cyclic voltammograms of lignans 6±9 showed oxidation potentials in the range 0.8±0.9 V, suggesting that they should act as rather less eective antioxidants than tocotrienols 1 and 2. The structure±activity correlations of these results can not be promptly inferred, as electron donor groups ortho to a hydroxyl should enhance the stabilization capacity of the molecule after hydrogen radical loss (Rice-Evans et al., 1996). The lower oxidation potential of tocotrienols might nonetheless be explained by the stabilization of the molecule conferred by the C-3 double bond conjugated with the aromatic ring, which might enhance the ease of oxidation of tocotrienols more eciently than the methoxyl group ortho to the hydroxyl group in lignans 6±9. Nevertheless, the qualitative analyses of the antioxidative properties of tocotrienols 1, 2 and lignans 6±9 through the b-carotene assay showed all these compounds were active, as previously referred.
Experimental
General experimental proceduresThe UV and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B and a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 1750 spectrophotometer, respectively. NMR spectra ( 1 H, 13 C,  COSY and NOE experiments) were measured on a BruÈ ker DPX-300 spectrometer (300 MHz for 1 H and 75 MHz for 13 C) in CDCl 3 for all compounds; the chemical shifts are reported in ppm with TMS as internal standard, and coupling constants (J) are given in Hz. EIMS spectra were measured at 70 eV on a HP 5988-A. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer CHN Elemental Analyzer 2400.
Plant materialFruits were collected in Reserva do Mocambo, in the Amazon Forest, in the rainy season and identi®ed as Iryanthera juruensis Warburg by Botanist Nelson Rosa. A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium JoaÄ o MurcË a Pires at Museu Paraense EmõÂ lio Goeldi.
Extraction and isolationThe dried fruits were grounded and extracted with hexane. The extract was dried under reduced pressure and partitioned between hexane and 90% methanol. The hydroalcoholic fraction (7.6 g) was submitted to vacuum column chromatography over silica gel, which was eluted with hexane/EtOAc mixtures of increasing polarity to yielded 8 fractions (A±H). Flash column chromatography over silica gel of fraction B eluted with gradient of hexane/EtOAc aorded 2 (31 mg), 4 (53 mg) and other 13 pooled fractions. Puri®cation of fractions B-5 and B-11 through prep. TLC (hexane/EtOAc 8:2) gave 3 (15 mg) and 1 (12 mg), respectively. Puri®cation of fraction B-8 through prep. TLC (hexane/EtOAc 8:2) gave the mixture of the o-arylalkanoic acids 5a±c, which was further puri®ed by HPLC (RP-18, MeOH/H 2 O 85:15) to aord 5a (5 mg) and 5c (6 mg). Compound 5b was not isolated as the HPLC analysis indicated it was a minor compound ($ 5% of the mixture of 5a±c 
LC/UV/MSThe separation of compounds 5a±c was achieved by using MeOH:H 2 O in the isocratic mode (85:15, 1 ml/ min.). UV spectra were recorded from 200 to 400 nm. For MS, the temperature of the electrospray (ES) source block was set to 75 C. The cone voltage was 70 V and ionization was achieved in the positive mode at an ionization voltage of 4.5 kV. Nitrogen was used as a nebulizing and curtain gas. Nebulizer gas was set to 0.5 l/min, curtain gas to 5.0 l/min. Full-scan spectra from m/z 150 to 550 were recorded every 1.2 s. 3.5. 2,7,7, 
Electrochemical assayThe cyclic voltammograms were carried out with a Polarecord E-506 (Metrohm) potentiostat. A three electrode system (663 VA, Metrohm) with a working electrode of glassy carbon (GC), a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a carbon auxiliary electrode was used. Dichoromethane (Merck) was used as solvent and tetra-n-butyl ammonium tetra¯uorborate (Merck), as the supporting electrolyte. Vitamin E (Aldrich) was used as reference compound. The working electrode was polished with aluminium oxide 0.3 mm (Buehler) and special polishing cloth (Buehler) prior to each measurement, because formation of a polymeric ®lm inactivated the electrode after each scan. The electrode was then washed thoroughly with water, dried and cycled several times in the range À1.6 to +0.6 V in order to reassure the absence of voltammetric signal due to the supporting electrolyte. Each compound was dissolved to concentrations of 10±20 mM in dichloromethane and added to a 15 ml aliquot of the supporting electrolyte. The solns. were then deoxygenated with nitrogen for 10 min. and the cyclic voltammograms were carried out at scan rate of 50 mV/s.Fig. 1 .1Fig. 1.
