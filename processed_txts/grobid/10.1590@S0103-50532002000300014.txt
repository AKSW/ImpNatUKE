Two known sesquiterpenoids β-eudesmol, cryptomeridiol and the triterpenoid 22,25dihydroxy-9β,19-cyclolanost-23-en-3-one were also isolated. The dichloromethane extract from the leaves of T. lepidota afforded a mixture of hydrocarbons (C 29 H 60 , C 31 H 64 and C 33 H 68 ), a mixture of the sesquiterpenes caryophyllene and humulene epoxides, spathulenol, and a series of sterols: 24methylene-12β-hydroxycholesterol, 24-methyl-12β-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one, 24-methylene-12βhydroxycholest-5-ene-3-palmitate; a mixture of 24-methylenecholesterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol; besides α-tocoferol and phytol. From the methanol extract it was isolated N-methyl-4-hydroxyproline. The structures of the isolated compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analysis.

IntroductionThe Meliaceae family has shown to be of much interest among phytochemists because either it contains plants which produce very complex chemical structures, or because of their biological activity, mainly against insects. As part of our interest in the chemistry of this family, we have already reported the isolation of γ-lactones from the fruits, 1 androstane and pregnane steroids from the steams 2 and cycloartane triterpenoids and a mixture of ω-phenyl alkanoic and alkenoic acids from the leaves 3 of Trichilia claussenii collected in Brazil. In continuation of our study of Trichilia species, we now report the isolation of five sesquiterpenoids and a cycloartane triterpenoid from the steams of T. claussenii and steroids from the leaves of T. lepidota Martius ssp schumanniana Harms, which has never been investigated before.
ExperimentalGeneral experimental procedures 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded at 400. 13 and 100.62 MHz, respectively, in a Bruker DRX spectrometer.The spectra were run in CDCl 3 with TMS as internal standard, pyridine-d 5 and D 2 O. DCCC was performed in an Eyela Droplet Counter Current Chromatograph D.C.C. -300. The GC-MS analyses were carried out with a Hewlett Packard System 5995 fitted with a dimethylpolysiloxane HP-1 (25 m x 0.20 mm i.d. x 0.30 film tickness) capillary column, with hydrogen as the carrier gas. The temperature was programmed initially at 120 o C for 2 min., then increased with a rate of 8 o C min -1 to 280 o C and kept for 20 min. The injection volume was 1 µL in a split mode and temperature of the injector was 280 o C. Isolation of the constituents from T. lepidota Leaves of T. lepidota Martius ssp schumanniana Harms were collected in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The CH 2 Cl 2 extract (7.5 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (n-hexane, CH 2 Cl 2 , EtOAc and MeOH). The n-hexane fraction (769 mg) afforded a mixture of hydrocarbons. Chromatography of the dichloromethane fraction yielded three fractions. Fr-1 (656 mg), after flash chromatography (nhexane:MeOH 49:1 v/v and n-hexane:Me 2 CO 99.4:0.6 v/v), was hydrolyzed with KOH (10%) in EtOH followed by chromatography on silica flash (n-hexane:Me 2 CO 99:1 v/v), to afford 4 mg of phytol. Fr-2 (770 mg), after flash chromatography and then prep-tlc (benzene:ethyl ether 99.6:0.4 v/v), afforded a mixture of sesquiterpenes: caryophyllene and humulene epoxides (7.3 mg) and αtocopherol (1.3 mg), spathulenol (35.6 mg) and 24methylen-12β-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-palmitate (3.8 mg) (8). Compound 8 was hydrolyzed with KOH (10%) in EtOH to yield 7 and a mixture of lauric, palmitic and stearic acids, which was methylated with diazomethane. Fr-3 (396 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel (n-hexane:EtOAc 4:1 v/v) and then on florisil (n-hexane:EtOAc 4:1 v/v), to yield 6 mg of a mixture of 24-methylenecholesterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol. Two fractions eluted with EtOAc were chromatographed on florisil using as eluent CH 2 Cl 2 and n-hexane:EtOAc (9:1 v/v), to afford 7 (30 mg) and 9 (1.5 mg) that was further purified by recycling-HPLC. The methanol extract was first submitted to a liquid-liquid partition, followed by DCCC of the MeOH fraction (4.4 g) using the mobile and stationary phases obtained from the organic and aqueous layers, respectively, of the mixture CHCl 
Results and DiscussionThe methanol extract of the stems of T. claussenii was submitted to solvent partition followed by several column chromatographies. This procedure led to the isolation and characterization of five sesquiterpenoids: two known eudesmane derivatives, β-eudesmol (1), and cryptomeridiol (2), one new elemane derivative, 14hydroxyelemol (3), two new germacrane derivatives, germacra-10( 14)-en-9,11,15-triol (4) and germacra-3,10( 14)-dien-9,11-diol-4-carbaldehyde (5), and one cycloartane triterpenoid, 22,25-dihydroxy-9β,19cyclolanost-23-en-3-one (6). The structures of the compounds were identified on the basis of their spectral data and comparison with compounds reported in the literature.The data reported for β-eudesmol 4 and cryptomeridiol 5,6 confirmed the structures for 1 and 2. Other possible isomers for 2 were ruled out through comparison with authentic compounds reported in the literature. 6,7 Compound 3 was established from 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum suggested the presence of hydroxyl groups (3401 cm -1 ). The 13 C NMR spectrum showed 15 carbon signals. The multiplicities of the carbons In the MS the parent ion observed, m/z 220, does not represent the molecular ion which was expected to be m/z 238, due to the loss of one molecule of water. The PENDANT spectrum showed four olefinic carbons at δ 148.0 (d), 147.7 (s), 113.2 (t) and 112.5 (d). The remaining unsaturations suggested that 3 was a monocyclic sesquiterpenoid. The proton signals at δ 1.39 (s) and 1.40 (s) in the 1 H NMR spectrum and at δ 27.4 (q), 27.8 (q) and 71.6 (s) in the PENDANT spectrum suggested the presence of a 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl group, which was confirmed in the mass spectrum by the fragment m/z 59. In the 1 H-1 H COSY experiment of 3, H-1 (δ 6.10, dd) was coupled to two H-2 (δ 5.20, dd and 5.36, dd). Both H-2 were coupled to each other. These olefinic signals suggested a vinyl group connected to a quaternary carbon. The olefinic protons H-3 (δ 4.95 and 4.79) were not coupled to other protons and the signals for C-3 (δ 112.5, t) and C-4 (δ 147.7, s) suggested an exomethylene group, where a methyl group H-15 (δ 1.78, s) is attached to C-4. These data together with consideration of isoprene rule led us to propose a sesquiterpene elemane derivative for 3. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 3 also showed an AX coupling system (δ 4.29, 4.03, both d, J 10.8 Hz) and the 13 C NMR showed a carbinolic carbon at δ 61.5 (t), which led us to suggest that methyl group (C-14) was replaced by a hydroxymethylene group. Other carbon data are described in Table 1. The attribution of the carbon signals was based on related elemanes from the literature. 8,9 Acetylation of 3 with acetic anhydride in pyridine provided the monoacetate of the primary alcohol (3a). The relative configurations of 3 were proposed on basis on the biogenesis of the elemane derivatives. 10 Compound 4 was also found to be a monocyclic sesquiterpenoid. The IR spectrum suggested the presence of hydroxyl groups (3396 cm -1 ). The 13  s, H-14a) and 5.27 (br. s, H-14b). The 1 H-1 H COSY spectrum showed that both carbinolic protons at δ 3.77 (dd, H-15a) and 3.66 (dd, H-15b) were coupled to each other and coupled to another proton at δ 2.25 (m, H-4). The HMBC experiment showed the correlation of the carbinolic proton at δ 4.59 (br. t, H-9) with the olefinic carbons C-10 and C-14, therefore H-9 should be carbinolic and allylic. The 1 H-1 H COSY experiment showed that H-9 was coupled with two protons at δ 2.36 (dt, H-8a) and 1.97 (dt, H-8b), which are both coupled to each other and coupled to another proton at δ 2.22 (m, H-7). The HMBC experiment showed that H-9 was also correlated with C-7 (δ 41.8) and C-1 (32.9). The presence of a 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl group was also characterized by the correlation of the methyl proton signals at δ 1.30 (s, H-12) and 1.40 (s, H-13) with the quaternary carbinolic carbon at δ 72.2 (C-11) in the HMBC experiment and the fragment m/z 59 in the mass spectrum. The possible bisabolane structure for compound 4 was ruled out by these correlations in addition to the correlations of C-11 with H-7 and C-7 with methyl protons (H-12 and H-13), which confirmed a germacrane structure for the sesquiterpenoid 4. The chemical shifts for C-12 and C-13 are very close for compounds 1 (∆δ 0.1), 2 (∆δ 0.6) and 3 (∆δ 0.4), and more distinct for 4 (∆δ 5.1). This difference may be due to the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl groups at C-9 and C-11, which might fix a preferential conformation. The chemical shifts observed for C-12 and C-13 for acetates 4a (∆δ 1.5), 4b (∆δ 2.1), and 4c (∆δ 1.3) suggested that the hydrogen bond is stronger when hydroxy group at C-9 is not esterified.The IR spectrum of 5 suggested the presence of hydroxyl (3417 cm -1 ) and α, β-unsaturated carbonyl (1684 cm -1 ) groups. The 1 H NMR spectrum showed two methyl groups at δ 1.14 (s, H-12) and 1.08 (s, H-13), one carbinolic and allylic proton at δ 4.26 (t, H-9) and three olefinic protons at δ 6.47 (dd, H-3), 5.12 (br. s, H-14), and 5.06 (br. s, H-14). A signal at δ 9.38 (d, H-15) suggested the presence of an aldehyde group. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 5 showed 15 carbon signals. The multiplicities of the carbons determined by DEPT led to the attribution of: 3 C, 4 CH, 6 CH 2 and 2 CH 3 . Four olefinic carbons were observed at δ 150.0 (d, C-3), 142.0 (s, C-4), 148.9 (s, C-10), and 115.5 (t, C-14), indicating the presence of two double bonds, including one exomethylene group. The signal at δ 195.2 (d, C-15) confirmed the presence of an aldehyde group. Two carbinolic carbons were observed at δ 72.8 (d, C-9) and 73.0 (s, C-11). The molecular formula proposed for 5 was C 15 H 24 O 3 . In the MS the parent ion observed, m/z 234, does not represent the molecular ion which was expected to be m/z 252, due to the loss of one molecule of water. Compound 5 was also found to be a germacrane sesquiterpenoid and the spectral data suggested the presence of one 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl group, similar to the other sesquiterpenoids described before. The chemical shifts for the olefinic proton (δ 6.47) and olefinicC NMR showed 15 carbon signals. The multiplicities of the carbons determined by PENDANT led to the attribution of 2 C, 3 CH, 8 CH 2 and 2 CH 3 , of which 3 were carbinolic carbons: δ 72.8 (d, C-9), 72.2 (s, C-11) and 67.4 (t, C-15). The carbon signals at δ 153.2 (s, C-10) and 111.2 (t, C-14) suggested the presence of an exomethylene group. The molecular formula proposed for 4 was C 15 H 28 O 3 . The 1 H NMR spectrum showed the olefinic proton signals at δ 5.66 (br.
Isolation of the constituents from T. claussenii Stems (2.4 kg) of T. claussenii were collected in Rio Claro, SP, Brazil, and a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Biociências, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil. The stems were dried, powdered and extracted with MeOH. The MeOH extract (45.7 g) was suspended in MeOH:H 2 O (1:3 v/v) and partitioned with CH 2 Cl 2 , EtOAc and n-BuOH. The CH 2 Cl 2 fraction was concentrated and then partitioned with hexane and MeOH.
