other features of the structure of surinamensin.The doublets centred at 6 1.19 (3H, J = 6 Hz) and 6 1.87 (3H, J = 5.5 Hz) could be ascribed to C-9 and C-9' Me groups, while the doublet at 6 4.62 (lH, J = 8 Hz) and the multiplet at 6 4.14 (1 H), were assigned to the methines at C-7 and C-S. The aromatic protons of C-2 and C-6 appeared as a singlet at 6 6.61 and the remaining ones as a multiplet at 6 6.9. Two additional signals, a doublet at 6 6.37 and a multiplet (lH, 6 6-6.24), were assigned to the protons of the tram double bond moiety at C-7' and C-8'. Double irradiation experiments at 100 MHz confirmed most of the above assignments.Irradiation at 6 1.87 simplifies the olelinic pattern, showing two doublets with J = 16 Hz, while irradiation at 6 1.19 transforms the multiplet at 6 4.14 into a doublet with J = 8 Hz. As expected, irradiation at the olefimc region or at S 4.14 collapses the doublets at 6 1.87 and 6 1.19 into two singlets respectively.That the A ring of surinamensin 4a is 3,4,5-trioxygenated, was established on the basis of the known shielding effect observed on the methoxyl groups with an unsubstituted ortho position, when d,C,H, is used as solvent for recording the PMR spectrum [3], and by identification of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid amongst the products of the KMnO, (Me&O) oxidation of surinamensin. Analysis of its MS confirmed the trimethoxybenzylic alcohol and isoeugenol moieties, on the basis of the ions at m/e 195 and 164, respectively. Further support for the proposed structure of surinamensin 4a, was obtained from the 13C NMR spectrum (cf. 5) [4].By phenol oxidation coupling of arylpropenoids, mixtures of erythro and threo-neolignans related to 4a were previously obtained, and their configurations assigned by analysis of their PMR spectra [S]. Comparison of the 6 and J values of the methines at C-7 and C-8 (Table 1) with the reported values, indicated that 4a OMe f; corresponds to the three series. Indication of the constitution of the contaminant of surinamensin was obtained by oxidation of the mixture with DDQ [6]. Chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture revealed two products which were isolated by PLC and submitted to MS analysis. One of these products (M+, m/e 386) was shown to be the oxidation product 9a of surinamensin, and the other one, (M+, m/e 356) was identified as the oxidation product of virolin (4b), by comparison with an authentic sample of 9b prepared as shown below. A careful inspection of the MS of samples of surinamensin and its acetylderivative, showed also the presence of virolin and its corresponding derivative. A diastereoisomeric mixture of erythroand threosurinamensin was prepared following the method described by Adler et al. [7], by treatment of3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde with ethylmagnesium bromide and the use of solid CO, in H,O to decompose the magnesium complex, the substituted benzylic alcohol 6 was obtained. Oxidation of 6 with Jones reagent afforded the corresponding ketone 7, which on bromination gave a mixture of bromoderivatives, including the bromoketone 8a, isolated by PLC. The treatment of 8a with the sodium salt of isoeugenol in DMF produced 9a, purified by PLC. NaBH, reduction of 9a gave the diastereoisomeric mixture represented by 4a, analyzed by PMR spectroscopy (Table 1). Again double irradiation experiments were used to confirm the assignments.Irradiation at 6 1.2 simplified the C-8 methine signals and two doublets at 6 4.18 and 4.36 with J = 8 and 3 Hz, corresponding to the threo and erythro isomers respectively, could be easily observed.The ketone 9b, used for comparison with the DDQ oxidation product of virolin (4b), was prepared by the method described above using the bromoketone 8b and the sodium salt of isoeugenol.
