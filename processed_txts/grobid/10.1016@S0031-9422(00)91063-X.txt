VELLOZONE, A TETRACYCLIC TRITERPENE FROM VELLOZIA STIPITATA"
The isolation of (2OR)-2O-hydroxy-24-methylenedammar-3-one from l&l/o;ia \tipir~~t(~ is described.

INTRODUCTIONPrevious papers [I, 21 have dealt with the chemical study of the hexane extract of ~&&ia sripiruta L. B. Smith 8~ Ayensu which led to the isolation of a naphthalenic norditerpene, lupeol, lupenone and 22-hydroxy-21/IHhopan-3-one.Subsequent work has resulted in the isolation of oleanolic acid and a new triterpene named vellozone (I) from the same extract. Vellozone, isolated in 0.6"~;, yield of the dry plant. had previously been obtained from I;. cllo$Jiu Martius [3].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe molecular formula ofvellozone (1). C31H5202 (1640 and 880cm-') and gem-dimethyl groups (1380cm ').The 'H NMR spectrum of 1 showed. irlter alia, signals for five quaternary methyl groups between (5 0.9 and 1.1, a signal at 1.18 for a methyl on the same carbon as an oxygen, and a doublet at 1.02 (6H, J = 7 Hz) assigned to an Isopropyl group. Two broad singlets at 4.7 and 4.76 and a signal at 1.38, which disappeared upon the addition of deuterium oxide, provided further evidence for a terminal methylene and hydroxyl group, respectively.A detailed study of the 13CNMR spectrum of this tetracyclic triterpene showed a signal at d 75.6, attributed to C-20 which bears a tertiary hydroxyl group [5]. Signals at 106.8 (t) and 157.4 (s) confirmed the presence of a terminal methylene group. The signals at 50.6, 47.6, 40. Reduction of vellozone with sodium borohydride gave a diol (2). This. upon acetylation with acetic anhydride and pyridine, gave a monoacetate(3) which presented absorption bands in the IR for a hydroxyl group as well as the terminal methylene and acetate groups.The 'H NMR of3 showed signals for six quaternary C-Me groups. an isopropyl group and one acetyl Me. The double doublet at 64.5 (.I = 10 and 6 Hz) is characteristic ofan acetyl carbinolic proton x-oriented in a cqclohexane ring, and supported the presence of a 3-keto group in vellozone.Analysis of the MS of 1 and its derivatives (Table 1 ) determined the nature of the tetracpclic skeleton.   12. 13.4 and 37.0 for four quaternary carbons, and a singlet at 219.3 suggested that vellozone had a dammaraneskeleton * Part IX in the series .'The Chemistry of S.

Campinas 13.100, SBo Paulo. Brazil, with a carbonyl group at C-3 [6]. The signals at 22.1 (y) and 34.1 (d) can be attributed to an isopropyl group 1 to a double bond, thua characterizing the nature of the side chain [7].
are given in parentheses. 7 lb + (b -18)], M* 107.4, observed; 107.3 calculated. Cleavage of ring C of 1,2, and 3, gave peaks at m/e 205, 207, and 249, respectively, which limited the choice of skeletons to the dammarane group and excluded the euphane and lanostane type skeletons [8,9]. Rupture of the bond between C-17 and C-20 gave peaks at m/e 315, 317 and 359 for the cyclic part of the three compounds [lo] and another at m/e 141, which in turn loses water (m* at m/e 107.3 corresponds to 141&123), for the side chain. The CD curve of 1 gave a weakly negative Cotton effect, similar to (20R)-20-hydroxydammar-24-en-3-one [ll 1, which made it possible to postulate the A and B-rings as being trans-anti-trans with the C-5 hydrogen cc-oriented. Care had to be taken when working with vellozone to avoid epimerization at C-20 (from R to S). This was observed to occur if, during the chromatographic purification of the extracts, the compound remained in contact with the Si gel for several days. Ozonolysis, in CH,Cl, at O", of the epimer gave Mills' trisnorlactone (4) [12,13], thus proving the R configuration at C-20 in vellozone. Thus vellozone is assigned the structure (20R)-20-hydroxy-24-methylenedammar-3-one. EXPERIMENTAL Mps are uncorr. IR spectra in KBr disc. 'H and '%NMR spectra were recorded in CDCI, at 100 and 25.2MHz. respectively, and chemical shifts (6 ppm) measured from TMS as internal standard.
