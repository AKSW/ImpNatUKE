ISOFLAVONE EVOLUTION IN MONOPTERYX"
Abstract--Monopteryxinput contains six 5,7-dihydroxyisoflavones, three of which, such as the novel 5,7-dihydroxy-8,3',4'-trimethoxy derivative, have additionally methoxyls on ring A. All three isoflavones of M. UUU~U are, by contrast, 7-hydroxy-S-methoxy derivatives. From the chemical standpoint, the former species thus appears to be more primitive than the latter.  The genus Monoptrryx Spr. ex Benth. (tribe Sophoreae, LeguminosaeePapilionoideae) was thought to comprise in Brazil M. uuucu Spr. ex Benth. and M. Llngusti@u Spr. ex Benth. [2] and in Venezuela M. jahnii PIttier [3]. Recently, however, an additional species, ~zil. inpcrr W. Rodr., was described [3] and it became desirable to examine the chemical affinity of the new species with at least M. uaucu, by far the more common and widespread of the two formerly known Brazilian species. M. inpue and ,!4. tuucu are trees which may attain considerable proportions. Their freshly cut trunk woods are reported to possess respectively coumarin [3] and balsamic [2] odour. The C,H, extracts of wood samples from both species contain elemicin, accompanied in the latter species by methyleugenol, methylchavicol and anethole, besides flavonoids (Table I ). The identification of the Ravanone 1 and of the isofavones 2a-2h relied on spectral analyses and comparisons of data obtained for the compounds, as well as for their methyl ethers and acetates, with the pertinent published data. The presence of a methoxyl flanked by two ortho substituents in 2f was confirmed by 13C NMR: one of the methyl peaks appeared at lower field (OMe-8, 6 61.1) than the other (OMe-4', 6 55.2) [l I 1. The location of the lone aromatic A-ring proton of the previously unknown 2e was deduced by its NMR chemical shift (66.36) which is compatible with ii 6.32 for H-6 in the known 2d, as compared to b 6.53 for H-8 in the equally known 2c [all measurements
