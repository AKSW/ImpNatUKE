NEOLIGNANS FROM LICARIA RIGID/i* \
Trunk wood of Licariu rigida Kosterm. (Lauraceae), collected at the Ducke Forest Reserve, near Manaus, Amazonas State, contains besides sitosterol, the neolignans (for nomenclature see [2]) eusiderin (la), eusiderin8(lb), canellin-A (2a) and canellin-C (2b). Eusiderin-B has not yet been found in any other plant, while la is known to occur in species of the genera Aniba,
Eusideroxylon, Licaria(Lauraceae) [2] and Mrola (Myristicaceae) [3]. The canellins were isolated originally from another Licaria species [4].  1) as well as mass spectral comparisons. A report on the sole question which is not trivial, namely the choice between the natural benzodioxane types 1 and the unnatural analogue 3, has appeared previously [5].   Manaus, 43576. A trunk wood sample, reduced to powder (8.5 kg), was percolated with C,H, at room temp. A powdery mixture of extract (1OOg) and Si gel (150g) was washed successively with C,H, and CHCI,. Evaporation of the C,H, soln gave a product (16g) which was chromatographed on Si gel (500g). Elution was performed initially with C,H, and then with solvent mixtures of gradually increasing polarity. Evaporation of the eluates (150ml each) gave 344 fractions. Fractions l-12 were composed of aliphatic material. Fractions 13-33 were purified by re-chromatography and crystallization from petrol to give lb (1.5 g). TLC (Si gel) of fractions 3472 gave a mixture of lb and sitosterol (0.1 g). Fractions 73-110 were purified by rechromatography and crystallization from MeOH to yield sitosterol(2.5 g). TLC (Si gel) of fractions 11 l-192 gave la (0.4 g). No pure compounds were isolated from later fractions. Evaporation of the CHCl, soln gave a product (34 g) which was chromatographed on Si gel (330g). Elution. initially with CHCl, EXPERIMENTAL lsolation of' constituents.
