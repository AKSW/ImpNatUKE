A New Imidazole Alkaloid and Other Constituents from Pilocarpus grandiflorus and their Antifungal Activity
The stems of Pilocarpus grandiflorus have afforded the new imidazole alkaloid 4,6-dehydro-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-2,5-dioxopilocarpine in addition to the 17 known compounds germanicol, βamiryn, ocotillone, stigmast-4-en-3-one, 3β -hydroxy-stigmast-5-en-7-one, 6β -hydroxy-stigmast-4en-3-one, β -sitosterol, scopoletin, 3-(1',1'-dimethylallyl)-scopoletin, elisin, dictamine, 4-methoxy-2quinolone, platydesmine, syringaresinol, syringaldehyde, syringic acid and vanillic acid. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence. The phenolic compounds vanillic acid and syringaldehyde and the furoquinoline alkaloid platydesmine exhibited antifungal activity against Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, the symbiotic fungus of leaf-cutting ants (Atta sexdens rubropilosa).

IntroductionPilocarpus commonly known as "Jaborandi" is a shrub belonging to the Rutaceae and comprises 16 neotropical species spread over tropical and subtropical America. In Brazil, the occurrence of thirteen species [1] has been reported. This genus has long been known as the most important source of the imidazole alkaloid pilocarpine. Imidazole alkaloids are histamine derivatives found only in the genus Casimiroa and Pilocarpus [2]. The alkaloid content in some Pilocarpus (0.5 -1.0%) consists mainly of the imidazole alkaloid pilocarpine, together with small amounts of pilosine and related structures. Pilocarpine salts are valuable in ophthalmic practice and used in eyedrops as miotics and for the treatment of glaucoma [3].Leaf-cutting ants of the genera Atta and Acromyrmex are among the most polyphagous agricultural pests of the South American countries. These ants cut vegetables for substrate of their symbiotic food fungus and produce consistent economic damage to the harvesting of the cultivated plants. The agricultural pest control 0932-0776 / 05 / 0700-0787 $ 06.00 c 2005 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen • http://znaturforsch.com practices generally involve toxic bait applications damaging the environment [4]. An alternative control for these insects can be achieved by inhibiting the growth of their symbiotic fungus through more selective and less toxic natural products than the baits existent in the market.In this paper, we report the isolation of 18 compounds, the structural elucidation of a new imidazole alkaloid and the evaluation of their activities as inhibitors of the growth of the symbiotic fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus of leaf-cutting ants, Atta sexdens rubropilosa.
Results and DiscussionIn continuation of our search for compounds to be used in the control of leaf-cutting ants [5 -15], we have investigated the dichloromethane extract of the stems of P. grandiflorus leading to the isolation of a new imidazole alkaloid (1) in addition to the known compounds germanicol (2) [16], β -amiryn (3) [17], ocotillone (4) [18], β -sitosterol (5) [19], stigmast-4-en-3-one (6) [20], 3β -hydroxy-stigmast-5-en-7-one (7) [21], 6β -hydroxy-stigmast-4-en-3-one (8) [22], sy-ringaresinol (9) [23], syringaldehyde (10) [24], syringic acid (11) [25], vanillic acid (12) [26], scopoletin 3.07 s 25.9 (13) [27], 3-(1',1'-dimethylallyl)-scopoletin ( 14) [28], elisin (15) [29], dictamine ( 16) [30], 1-methyl-4methoxy-2-quinolone ( 17) [31] and platydesmine ( 18) [32].The known compounds were identified by comparison of their physical and spectral data with those already reported in the literature. The new imidazole alkaloid had its structure determined on the basis of chemical and spectral evidence. The new alkaloid 1 had spectroscopic characteristics of the known imidazole alkaloid pilocarpine. The HREIMS spectrum displayed a molecular ion at m/z 238.0935 in accordance with the molecular formula C 11 H 14 O 4 N 2 . The 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed signals at δ = 1.01 (3H, t, J = 7.4 Hz), δ = 1.84 (1H, m) and δ = 1.38 (1H, m) indicating an ethyl group; two doubledoublets at δ = 4.42 (1H, dd, J = 9.0, 5.4 Hz) and δ = 4.08 (1H, dd, J = 9.0, 2.0 Hz) for protons of oxygenated carbons at δ = 71.7 and other lactone carbon at δ = 177.8 and the signals at δ = 2.67 (1H, ddd, J = 8.0, 7.0, 5.0 Hz), δ = 4.76 (1H, dddd, J = 11.5, 7.0, 5.4, 2.0 Hz) indicating a pattern similar to pilocarpine. The 13 C NMR spectrum for 1 (Table 1) showed eleven carbons in agreement with the imidazole alkaloid structure. The signals at δ = 177.7, 162.4, 152.4, 132.2 and 112.3 suggesting a change in the structure of pilocarpine with two additional carbonyl groups and a double bond. The absence of a signal in the aromatic region and the signal at δ = 5.23 (1H, d, 11.0 Hz) in addition to the two carbonyl observed in the 13 C NMR spectrum suggests a modification of the imidazole ring. This is supported by HMBC spectrum (Table 2), which showed a correlation of the N-methyl group to the carbonyl C-2 and C-9 at δ = 152.4 ( 3 J) and 162.4 ( 3 J), and from H-6 to  6) 100 0 3β -Hydroxystigmast-5-en-7-one (7) 6 0 2 0 Syringaresinol (9) 5 0 0 Syringaldehyde (10) 5 0 8 0 Vanillic acid (12) 5 0 8 0 Dictamine (16) 4 0 4 0 1-Methyl-4-methoxy-2-quinolone ( 17) 60 0 Platydesmine (18) 5 0 8 0 the C-4 and C-5 at δ = 132.2 ( 3 J) and 162.4 ( 3 J). In the HSQC spectrum, the carbon at δ = 35.7 was correlated with the signal at δ = 4.76. This value can be explained by anisotropic effects of the carbonyl group and the double bond. The G-NOESY experiments (Table 3) showed correlations of H-6 with the N-3-methyl group and H-8, requiring a cis configuration for the double bond.The dichloromethane extract of the stems as well as fractions of P. grandiflorus showed strong inhibitory activity on the growth of L. gongylophorus. Among the 18 isolated compounds, the phenolic compounds syringaldehyde (10) and vanillic acid (12) and the furoquinoline alkaloid platydesmine (18) exhibited higher inhibition of the fungal growth at 50 µg ml -1 .Antifungal activities have been described for phenolic compounds against Cladosporium herbarum [33], Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus [34], Geotrichum candidum, Coriolus versicolor, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Mycelia sterilia [35].Grayer and Harbone [36] suggested that furoquinoline alkaloids might also play a role in the defense of plants against potentially pathogenic fungi. The result of our search confirmed the antifungal activity for this compound against L. gongylophorus.
