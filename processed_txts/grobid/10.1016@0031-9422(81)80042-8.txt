COUMARINS FROM PTEROCAULON BALANSAE AND P. LANATUM
Analysis of the petrol-diethyl ether extracts of Pterocaulon balansae and P. lanatum aerial parts afforded, besides puberulin, scopoletin-[2',3'-dihydroxy-3'-methylbutyl-( 1 ')]ether, scopoletin-[2',3'-epoxy-3'-methylbutyl-(1 ')I ether and 7-(3-methyl-2,3-epoxybutyloxy)-5,6-methylenedioxycoumarin, four new related coumarins. The isolation of these coumarins may constitute a valid index for the chemotaxonomic characterization of genus.

INTRODUCTIONThe genus Pterocaulon has 25-30 species. P. balansae Chodat. and P. lanatum 0. Kuntze subshrubby plants from the Compositae family occur almost exclusively in the central part of the South America [l]. P. balansae species is very easily confused with P. alopecuroides (Lam.) DC a synonym of Conyza alopecuroides Lam. [ 11. Some ConVza species afford coumarin compounds [2] as well as P. sphacelatum Benth & Hook [3], the only Pterocaulon species already studied. The present communication deals with the isolation of eight coumarins from the aerial parts of P. balansae and P. lanatum.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe petrol-Et,0 extracts from the aerial parts of the plants on chromatography yielded substances 1 to 8.1,2 and 3 are common to both plants, 1 and 6 were first isolated from Pteronia glabrata L.f. and P. ciliata Thunb. respectively [4], 3 and 5 from Conyza obscura DC [2].Compound 2, a new isomer of sabandinol (9) [5], was elucidated on the basis of spectral data and confirmed by acidic epoxide cleavage of 1.Of the remaining three compounds, those of composition C16H1s06 and C,,H,,O, have UV spectra essentially superimposable on that of 6, leading to the conclusion that all three have the same oxygenation pattern. 'H NMR spectra ofboth substances show signals for C-4 protons at J 7.57 and 6 7.63 respectively, suggesting the lack of an oxygenated function at C-5. By running 'H NMR spectrain both CDCl, and C,D, it was possible to locate OMe groups at C-6 and C-8 [7]. These data are in agreement with the structures 4 and 8 respectively, which were proved by epoxidation of 6 followed by acidic cleavage of the epoxide.The last coumarin with composition C15H1405 must have a methylene-dioxy group and dimethylallyloxy group which is evident from 'H NMR analysis (Table 1) through the peaks at 6 6.08 and b 4.93 respectively. The only aromatic proton must be located at C-S since the C-4 proton resonates at 68.04 [6]. These data suggest two possible structures (7 and 10) from which we choose 7 because of the pronounced diamagnetic shift of the methylenedioxy protons (0.91 ppm) when the 'H NMR spectrum is recorded in CDCI, and C,D, (Table 1) [4]. EXPERIMENTAL 1 7 [R17General methods. UV were run in EtOH; IR in KBr pellets: IHNMR spectra at 6OMHz; MS at 70eV; mps are uncorr.; column chromatography and TLC were performed with Si gel. The identity of the known products was established by comparison of their physical data with those of authentic samples. Plant materials were collected at the surroundings of UNICAMP in July 1979, and the fresh aerial parts, ground, percolated with petrol-Et,0(1:2), coned under red. pres. at room temp. and fractioned by column chromatography (elution: hexane-CHCl, and CHCl,-MeOH).Extraction of Pterocaulon balansae Chodat.
