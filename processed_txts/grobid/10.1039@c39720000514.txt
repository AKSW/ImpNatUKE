Intramolecular hydrogen bonding made a direct deduction of the lactone ring size in rubrenolide uncertain (vw 1745 cm-l), but the acetonide, C,oH3@4, m.p. 47-48", prepared from dihydrorubrenolide, acetone, and anhydrous copper sulphate was clearly a y-lactone (vco 1770 cm-l). The C,,-skeleton of rubrenolide was determined by transforming dihydrorubrenolide to 4-methylhexadecane (111) by the sequence : (i) reduction (LiAlH,), (ii) formation of a tetramesylate, and (iii) hydrogenolysis (LiAlH,) . Vigorous oxidation of rubrenolide with chromium trioxide in boiling acetic acid gave sebacic acid, H02C[CH,]8C0,H. Thus, two possible constitutions (IIa) or (IIb) could be considered for rubrenolide, and a decision between these was possible on the following evidence. Mild oxidation of rubrenolide (Cr0,-HOAc ; room temp.) yielded a vinylic (vet 1645,990, and 910cm-l) lactonic acid (vw 1760 and 1700 cm-l), C16HZ6O4, m.p. 95-98" (IIc), whose n.m.r. spectrum showed an ABX system (HA T 7.05, HB T 7.49, Hx m, T GU. 7.0; J B B 17-5, JAx 3.5, and JBx 8.5 Hz) whichhad to be associated with the oxidatively generated carboxygroup (HO,C-CHAHB-CHx<). A corresponding ABX system was also identifiable in the n.m.r. spectrum of the lactonic acid methyl ester (IId).These results established the constitutions of rubrenolide (Ia) and rubrynolide (Ib) and these proposals were fully confirmed by examination of the high resolution mass spectra and n.m.r. spectra of the two compounds and their derivatives. The assignment (Table ) of   The branched chained C,,-compounds, rubrenolide (Ia) and rubrynolide (Ib) from Nectundru rubru (Lauraceae) show an interesting biogenetic relation to the family of structurally related linear C,,-compounds [e.g. (IVa) and (IVb)] recently isolated from the seed of the avocado pear, Perseu umericunu (Lauraceae) . 8 A proposed phytochemical r e l a t i ~n ~, ~ between these two classes of C,,-compounds isolated from Lauraceae may be extended to include some Cll-and C13-compounds, (V)-(VII) from Litseu odiferu.The natural products (Ia), (IIa), (IVa), (IVb and related compounds4), (V), (VI), and (VII) may all be derived as biosynthetic variants upon the acetate-malonate route to saturated fatty acids ; 7 the biogenetic correlation between the natural product types (I) and (IV) is indicated by numbers.(Received, 8th February 1972; Corn. 203.)Constitutions of Rubrenolide and Rubrynolide: an Alkene-Alkyne Pair from Nectandra mbra By N.
