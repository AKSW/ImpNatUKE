XANTHONES FROM KIELMEYERA EXCELSA'
AWrsct-2-Hydroxyxanthone, 1,7-dihydroxyxan&me, 1 -hydroxy-7-methoxyxanthow, 2-hydroxy-1 -methA oxyxanthme, l&ncthykncdioxyxanth~e and 2,8dihydroxy-l-methoxyxanthone were isolated from the wood of Kieimeyera exceka Camb.THE WOOD of Kiehneyeca excelsa Camb. was found to contain 2-hydroxyxanthone, 1,7dihydroxyxanthone (euxanthone), 1-hydroxy-7-methoxyxanthone, 2-hydroxy-l-methoxyxanthone and 2,8dihydroxy-1-methoxyxanthone.All these compounds had already been isolated previously from other species of the same genus2 and were identified by direct comparison with authentic samples. Only one constituent proved to be a new natural compound. The molecular weight, determined by mass spectrometry, fitted a methylenedioxyxanthone structure. Resides the molecular ion peak, this spectrum contained only one more intense peak at M-l mass units. The ease with which the molecule loses a hydrogen atom was also indicative of a methylenedioxy-benzene system which aromatizes upon electron impact. Of the three possible methylenedioxyxanthones, only the 1,2derivative was given consideration, in view of its probable biosynthetic relationship to 2-hydroxy-lmethoxyxanthone. Indeed, treatment of the natural isolate with PC& and hydrolysis of the reaction product 3 yielded 1,2-dihydroxyxanthone.1,2-Methylenedioxyxanthone, which has been synthesixed,4 is the fourth natural methylenedioxyxanthone to be reported. Other representatives of this relatively small group include 4-hydroxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone, 4-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone 5 and 1,2,4-trimethoxy-6,7-methylenedioxyxanthone.6 1,2-Oxygenation of a xanthone ring is not common among Kieimeyera constituents. Up to now, the only principal metabolites to be characterized by this structural feature were found to occur in K. petiolaris (Spr.) Mart.' Within the Guttiferae family, K. exceisa and K. petiolaris form a pair of vicarious species,* stemming from a common ancestor, but thriving presently in contiguous, but different ecological environment. K. excelsa is found a Part XlX in the series "The Chcanistry of Brazilian Guttiferae" ; for part XVIII see D. DE BARNIS Coti,

in the humid tropical forest of the Atlantic coast, while K. petiolaris grows in the dry savannah-like region of central Brazil. The similarity in oxygenation pattern of the xanthonic constituents of these species is, consequently, paralleled by their morphological and phylogenetic a@nity.
EXPERIMENTALFor experimental techniques see the preceding paper of this series.' The identification of all substances was confirmed by direct comparison (co-chromatography, mixture m.p., U.V. and i.r. spectra) with authentic samples.Benzene extraction of the sapwood of Kielmeyera excelsa. Isolation of euxanthone, 2-hyabxyxanthone, l-hydroxy-7+nethoxyxanthone, 1,2-nsethylcncdloxyxaxthone, /I-sitosterol, 2,8-dihydroxy-I-methoxyxanthone a&2-hyakoxy-1-methoxyxanthone. The powdered wood (12 kg) wascontinuouslyextracted with hot benxene. Removal of the benxene gave a residue (475 g) which was taken up with a small volume of benxene. An insoluble crystalline~mass (2.1 g) which appeared was separated by filtration from.the benxene solution and chromatographed on silica (50 g) giving various fractions with the indicated solvents: benxene (A,), benzene-CHQ, 2: 1 (AI), benzene-CHCl,, 1: 2 (AS). The benzene solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue (45.0 g) was chromatographed on silica (900 g) giving various fraction with the indicated solvents: benzene (Bl), CHCll and CHCl&IeOH, 99: 1 (BI), CHCI,-MeGH, 99:2 (B,, B,, B5 in this order). A, was recrystallized from benzene-EtOH yielding an aiiphatic aldehyde (25 mg), m.p. 83-87", v=: 2912, 2830,1738,1600,1460,1175,730,720cm-', which wasnot furtherexamined. A, wasrecrystallixed from EtOH yieldingeuxanthone (20 mg). As (0.2 g) was rechromatographed on silica to separate an additional small quantity of euxanthone from a fraction which, upon crystallization from ethanol, yielded 2-hydroxyxanthone (43 mg). B, (1.3 g) was crystapixed from light petroleum-benxene yiekiing I-hydroxy-7methoxyxanthone(100 mg). B1 (05 g) was subjected to fractional crystallizations from ethyl acetate. Initial crops : 1 f-methylenedioxyxanthone (16 mg). Last crops: aliphatic alcohol (5 mg), m.p. 82-84". ~~3400,2930,2860.1475, 1050,725 cm-', which was not further examined. Br (2 g) was submitted to fractional crystallization from acetone. Initial crops: p-sitosterol(l71 mg). Last crops: 1,2-methylenedioxyxanthone (190 mg). B, (15 g) was washed with light petroleum. From the insoluble part nothing useful could be isolated. The soluble part (0.2 g) was separated by thick layer chromatography (silica, CHCl,-acetone, 95:5) into 2,8dihydroxy-lmethoxyxanthone (94 mg, after recrystallization from CHCIr), 1 -methoxy-2-hydroxyxanthone (19 mg, after recrystalliition from light petroleum-benzene), euxanthone and 2-hydroxyxanthone (small quantities), quoted in order of decreasing Rfi Bs (2.9 g) was freed from resin by filtration through silica and recrystallii from ethyl acetate yiekling an aliphatic compound, m.p. 87-88", #2:2930,2860, 1713, 1460 cm-', which was not further examined.
