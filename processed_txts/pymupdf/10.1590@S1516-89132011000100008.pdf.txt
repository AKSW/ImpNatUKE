The dictamine, skimianine,  sitosterol and stigmasterol were also isolated from methanol extract. Extracellular forms of Leishmania  amazonensis (promastigotes) was tested with dichloromethane extract and 28-hydroxy-28, 29-dihydrolupeol with  showed anti-leishmanial activity above 0.1 mg/mL and 75µg/mL (inhibited 50% promastigote growth), respectively.

The disease is endemic in Southern Brazil  where it constitutes a serious heath problem,  causing a spectrum of disease ranging from small  cutaneous  lesion  to  disseminated  visceral  leishmaniasis (Silveira et al., 1999). In Brazil,  phlebotomine control is made by insecticide  application in the houses and enclosures built in  the peridomestic area (Teodoro et al., 1998, 2004).  In leishmaniasis, the chemotherapy available so far  is limited to the pentavalent antimonials such as  sodium stibogluconate (Pentostan) and meglumine  antimoniate (Glucantime), was introduced over 50  years ago. Both forms require lengthy parenteral  administration and have severely toxic side effects,  including renal and cardiac toxicity (Ministério da  Saúde, 2000). Thus the drugs that are more  effective, less toxic, and easier to use are urgently  needed.   The family Rutaceae has been found to contain  many secondary metabolites such as alkaloids,  coumarins and lignans with a large spectrum of  biological activites such as leishmanicidal activity  (Lewis et al., 1983). Extracts from Galipea  longiflora, Rutaceae species used by the Chimane  Indians in Bolivia for the treatment of cutaneous  leishmaniasis  produced  by  Leishmania  braziliensis, showed in vitro activity against  Leishmania species (Fournet et al., 1996) and the  butanol fraction of Almeidea coerulea was active  against the trypomastigote form of Trypanosoma    Cortez, L. E. R. et al.  Braz. Arch. Biol. Technol. v.54 n. 1: pp. 61-66, Jan/Feb 2011  62 cruzi (Mafezoli et al., 2000). The aim of this work  to study the isolation and the structural elucidation  of one indolopyridoquinazoline alkaloid (1), two  furoquinoline alkaloids (2 and 3), one lupane  triterpene 4 and one mixture of steroids (5 and 6)  and to evaluate the activity of the compound 4  against Leishmania (L.) amazonensis.       MATERIALS AND METHODS    General  The NMR spectra were obtained in a BRUKER  DRX400 (9.4 T) and VARIAN GEMINI300  (7.05T), using deuterated solvent for field  homogeneity, TMS as internal standard and  temperature constant of 298K. For gHMBC the  coupling constants were optimised for 4, 6, 8 and  12 Hz. IR: film NaCl plates; ESI-MSMS: low  resolution on a triple quadrupole were recorded on  a Micromass Quattro LC instrument equipped with  a “Z-spray”ion source, and EI-MS on a CG/EM- SHIMADZU QP 2000 A. CC: silica gel 60 (70- 230 and 230-400 mesh); TLC: silica gel plates F254  (0.25 mm in thickness).    Plant Materials  The aerial parts of Almeidea coerulea (Nees and  Mart.) A.St.-Hil. were collected from Itacaré,  Bahia, Brazil, in February 1993. The specimen  was identified by Dr. Jose Pirani from the  Department of Botany of the University of São  Paulo (Brazil) and the voucher herbarium  specimen (Pirani and Kallunki 2747) deposited in  the University of Maringá (Brazil).    Isolation of Constituents  The dichloromethane extract (8.1 g) and the  methanol extract (22.1 g) of the stem the A.  coerulea  was  submitted  to  vacuum  chromatography over an microcrystalline cellulose  (Avicel�) support and eluted with n-hexane, n- hexane-CHCl3 (1:1), CHCl3, CHCl3-EtOAc (1:1),  EtOAc, and MeOH with gave seven fractions of  each extract. The fraction 3 (1,47 g) from  dichloromethane extract was chromatographed in  silica gel columns using hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc- Acetone gradient solvents to 156 fractions. The  fractions  30  to  47  (239  mg)  were  rechromatographed in silica gel (230-400 mesh)  successively to fractions 26 (17 mg) and 36 (13  mg). The fractions were purified by gel filtration  columns on Sephadex LH-20 with MeOH-ChCl3  (1:1) to obtain the compounds 1 (1.8 mg) and 4  (22.3 mg). The fraction 2 (1.14 g) from methanol  extract was chromatographed in silica gel columns  using  hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-Acetone  gradient  solvents to obtain the compounds 3 (3mg) and  mixture 5 and 6 (3 mg). The fractions 21 to 25 was  chromatographed in gel filtration columns on  Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH-CHCl3 (1:1)  to the fraction 34 and was purified by silica gel  column, hexane-acetone (17:3) to obtain the  compound 2 (3.8 mg).    Culture and Maintenance of the Parasites  The promastigotes forms of Leishmania (L.)  amazonensis strain MHOM/BR73/M2269 were  cultured and tested in the 199 medium (Gibco,  BRL) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Cultilab,  Brazil), 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/mL),  and streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL) (Sigma) at 25 oC.  They were then used in the exponential phase of  growth (day 4 of culture).  The  compound  4  was  dissolved  in  dimethylsufoxide (DMSO) and then diluted in the  199 medium. The final concentration of DMSO  did not exceed 0.05%. For promastigote drug  susceptibility determinations, the parasites were  placed in each test well of a 24-well micro culture  plate  (Costar,  Cambridge,  MA)  at  1x105promastigotes/mL of culture medium and  incubated in triplicates with various concentration  of alkaloids 9 at 25oC for 24, 48, 72 and 96h. The  compound 4 was only added at the beginning of  the cultivation. Controls cultures were incubated  with the same dilution of DMSO or pentamidine  isethionate (0.7µg/mL).  Promastigotes  were  counted  using  a  hemocytometer, after it was passed five times  through a 25-gauge needle in order to have  separate clumps.  11-hydroxyrutaecarpine (1).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION    Figures  2  and  3  show  the  activity  of  dichloromethane extract and compound 4 on  promastigotes in concentrations from 0.001 to 6  mg/mL and from 10 to 100µg/mL, respectively.  Dichloromethane extract was active against  promastigote forms at concentrations above 0.1  mg/mL.  Compound  4  inhibited  50%  or  more (p<0.01) promastigote growth in comparison  to the non-treated controls at every period of  time  studied, except for 96h, showing the effect starting  from 25µg/mL. The reference drug, pentamidine  isethionate (0.7µg/mL) inhibited the growth of  promastigotes more than 50%, starting from 24 h  of cultivation. Compound 4 was active only above  75µg/mL, from 24 to 48 h. The dichloromethane  extract from the stems of A. coerulea gave one  alkaloid (1) and one triterpene (4) and the  methanol extract gave two alkaloids (2) and (3)  and one mixture of steroids (5) and (6). Four of  them showed identical 1H and 13C NMR spectra as  dictamine (2) (Chen et al., 1996) skimianine (3)  (Chakravarty et al., 1999) and mixture of sitosterol  and stigmasterol (5/6) (Pinto et al., 1994) and 28- hydroxy-28,29-dihydrolupeol (4), (Fig 1) which  was established by 13C by the spectral data and  comparison with literature data (Wenkert et al.,  1978; Razdan et al., 1998). The molecular formula  of compound 1 was established as C18H13N3O2 by  the combination of ESI-MSMS and 13C NMR  spectra. The IR spectrum of compound 1 showed  absorption of a conjugated carbonyl group   1653 cm-1. The 1H NMR spectrum supported by a   H-HCOSY experiment indicated the presence of  one 1,2,4-substituted aromatic ring, two coupled  methylenes, one 1,2-substituted aromatic ring and  one phenolic hydroxyl and amino groups (Table  1). The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed  two symmetrical triplets at δ 4.40 and δ 3.09,  corresponding to protons H-7 and H-8. The NH  indolic group at δ 9.41 (br s) was supported by  literature data of rutaecarpine (Ikuta et al., 1998).
