Abstract: Ethyl acetate extracts of cultures grown in liquid Czapek and on solid  rice media of the fungal endophyte Fusarium oxysporum SS46 isolated from the  medicinal plant Smallanthus sonchifolius (Poepp.) H. Rob., Asteraceae, exhibited  considerable cytotoxic activity when tested in vitro against human cancer cells.  Chromatographic separation yielded anhydrofusarubin (1) and beauvericin (2) that  were identified based on their 1H and 13C NMR data. Compounds 1 and 2 showed  the strongest cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines. Compound 2 also  showed promising activity against Leishmania braziliensis. Hexanic extract of F.  oxysporum SS50 grown on solid rice media also afforded a mixture of compounds  that displayed cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines. Chemical  analysis of the mixture of compounds, investigated by gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry (GC-MS), showed that there was a predominance of methyl esters of  fatty acids and alkanes.  Keywords: beauvericin citotoxic activity endophytic fungus Fusarium oxysporum Leishmania braziliensis  Introduction   Microorganisms are recognized as proliﬁ c  producers of bioactive natural products, many of them  useful as clinical drugs (Gunatilaka, 2006; Newman  & Cragg, 2012). Newman and Gragg (2012) recently  emphasized that efforts to discover new bioactive natural  products should focus on microorganisms living in  interactions with their hosts. Endophytes are one type  of such microorganisms, since they spend the whole or  part of their lifespan inside the healthy tissues of the host  inter- and/or intracellularly without causing discernible  symptoms of plant disease (Borges et al., 2009).  Natural products from fungal endophytes have a broad  spectrum of biological activities, such as antimicrobial,  immunosuppressant, anticancer, and also may act as  biocontrol agents (Gunatilaka, 2006; Borges et al.,  2009).    As part of our ongoing research on endophytic  fungi found in association with Asteraceae species we  have identiﬁ ed several bioactive extracts and compounds,  as well as novel natural products (Gallo et al.; 2009;  2010; Guimarães et al., 2010; Borges et al., 2011).   In this paper, we report the chemical and  biological of two fungal strains of Fusarium oxysporum,  coded as SS46 and SS50, isolated as endophytes from the  medicinal plant Smallanthus sonchifolius (Asteraceae). Materials and Methods General procedures   1D (regular 1H and 13C) and 2D nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on  Bruker spectrometer (DPX-500), working at 500 MHz  for 1H, and at 125 MHz for 13C. Tetramethylsilane (TMS)  was used as internal reference. Column chromatographies  were performed over silica gel 60, 230-280 mesh  Article Bioactive extracts and chemical constituents of two endophytic strains of  Fusarium oxysporum   Andréa M. do Nascimento et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz. J. Pharmacogn. 22(6): Nov./Dec. 2012 1277 (Ultra Chem) or Sephadex LH-20. Vacuum liquid  chromatography (VLC) was carried out silica gel 60  H, 70-230 mesh (Merck). Thin-Layer chromatography  (TLC) was performed on sílica gel 60 GF254 (Merck).  Spots were located by spraying with anisaldehyde– sulfuric acid reagent, heated at 110 °C.  Isolation of strains    The endophytic fungal strains were isolated from  the roots of S. sonchifolius according to the procedure  described by Gallo et al. (2009). After collection, the plant  material was washed with water and surface sterilized by  immersion in 70% aqueous ethanol (2.5 min), followed  by 2.5% aqueous sodium hypochlorite (30”, 60” or 90”),  and ﬁnally with 70% aqueous ethanol (1 min). After these  procedures, the leaves and roots were rinsed with sterilized  water. This latter water was incubated in Petri dishes to  ensure the elimination of all epiphytic microorganisms.  Small pieces of the leaves and roots were excised and  placed on agar in Petri dishes containing potato dextrose  agar (PDA) medium at 30 °C. Individual hyphal tips of the  emerging fungi were removed and placed on PDA slants. Fermentation and extraction procedures    Both F. oxysporum strains were cultured in  liquid Czapek and solid rice media. Liquid cultures were  conducted in two steps. First, the silica stored fungi were  inoculated onto PDA-containing medium in Petri dishes  and incubated at 30 oC for seven days. After this period,  the pre-inoculum was prepared by transferring the agar  plugs (0.5 cm diameter) cut from the 7-day-old original  cultures into 50 mL Falcon flasks containing 10 mL  of rich medium (5 g tryptone, 10 g dextrose, 3 g yeast  extract, 10 g malt extract, in 1000 mL ﬁnal volume of  H2O, pH 6.2±0.2), and incubated for three days at 25 oC,  120 rpm. After this period, the pre-inoculum (20 mL) was  transferred to a 1000 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing  200 mL of Czapek medium and incubated at 25 oC for 14  or 21 days (120 rpm). Nine Erlenmeyer flasks were used  for a large scale extract production, aiming to isolate  secondary metabolites. After 21 days 200 mL of ethanol  were added to each flask, the resulting suspension was  vacuum-ﬁltered and the ﬁltrate fractionated by liquid- liquid partition with ethyl acetate. The resulting organic  layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to produce  the ethyl acetate extracts (EaL). Fermentations of F.  oxysporum SS46 and F. oxysporum SS50 carried out  for fourteen days yielded, respectively, 1.4289 g (coded  SS46-EaL14) and 1.0884 g (coded SS50-EaL14) of EaL  extracts. After 21 days of incubation, F. oxysporum SS46  yielded 0.8082 g of EaL extract (coded SS46-EaL). F.  oxysporum SS50 was cultured only for 14 days. A Falcon  flask containing seed medium without inoculum was  submitted to the same preculture conditions. The resulting  pre-inoculum was transferred to Czapek medium and  treated in the same way for control purposes.   The solid fermentation experiments were  carried out in ten 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing  90 g of parboiled rice in 90 mL distilled water per flask,  previously twice autoclaved at 120 oC for 40 min for each  fungal strain. Agar plugs (about 2 x 2 cm) cut from the  7-day-old original cultures on PDA agar were used for  inoculation. One flask, without inoculum, was kept for  control use. After 21 days incubation in a BOD (Biological  Oxygen Demand) device at 30 oC, 150 mL of methanol  were added to each flask and the contents were allowed  to stand overnight at room temperature. The methanol  was ﬁltered and evaporated under reduced pressure  yielding the methanol extract, which was submitted to  the liquid-liquid partition with hexane and ethyl acetate.  The resulting organic layer was evaporated under  reduced pressure to produce the hexanic and ethyl acetate  extracts. Solid culture of F. oxysporum SS46 afforded  0.41 g of the hexanic extract (SS46-HxS) and 2.89 g of  the ethyl acetate extract (SS46-EaS). Fermentation of F.  oxysporum SS50 yielded 0.16 g of the hexanic extract  (SS50-HxS) and 0.84 g and ethyl acetate extract (SS50- EaS).  Isolation of compounds   The  SS46-EaS  extract  (2.77  g)  was  chromatographed by vacuum liquid chromatography  (VLC) on silica gel and eluted with hexane, hexane/ethyl  acetate (gradient), ethyl acetate/methanol (gradient) and  methanol to give ten fractions (F1-F10). Fraction F5  (100 mg) was puriﬁed by chromatography on a Sephadex  LH-20 column using methanol as eluent to give 1 (5.2  mg). The SS46-EaL extract (89 mg) was puriﬁed by  chromatography on a column packed with silica gel 60.  Elution with hexane/ethyl acetate 8:2 and 2:8, (crescent  gradient), ethyl acetate/methanol 19:1 and methanol  100% afforded twenty fractions, which were combined  in nine sub-fractions according to TLC analysis. The  sub-fraction 7 (6.1 mg) was identiﬁed as 2. The SS50- HxS extract (155.4 mg), obtained after 21 days on rice  medium, was investigated by gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry (GC-MS).  Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)    The SS50-HxS extract was analyzed on a  Shimadzu QP-2010 gas chromatograph interfaced to a  mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The following conditions  were used: DB-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25  μm); helium (99.999%) carrier gas at a constant flow of  1.1 mL/min; 1 μL injection volume; injector split ratio  of 1:40; injector temperature 240 °C; electron impact  Bioactive extracts and chemical constituents of two endophytic strains of  Fusarium oxysporum   Andréa M. do Nascimento et al.

The oven  temperature was programmed from 100 ºC (isothermal for  5 min), with an increase of 10 ºC/min to 250 ºC (isothermal  for 5 min), and 10 ºC/min to 280 ºC (isothermal for 15  min). A mixture of linear hydrocarbons (C9H20-C40H82)  was injected under the same conditions as standards, and  identiﬁcation of constituents performed by comparing the  spectra obtained with those of the equipment’s database  (Wiley 7 lib), and by using the Kovats Index, calculated  for each constituent as previously described (Adams,  1995; Van den Dool & Kratz, 1963).  Cytotoxic bioassay    Human  tumor  cell  lines  MDA-MB435  (melanoma), HCT-8 (colon), and SF295 (brain) were  obtained from National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD,  USA). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium,  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%  antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Cultures were  maintained in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 °C and 5%  CO2 atmosphere. The cytotoxic effect was assessed using  the MTT-dye reduction assay for cell viability described  by Mosmann (1983) according to an established protocol.  Briefly, tumor cells were placed in 96-well plates at  the following densities: 0.7 × 105  (HCT-8), 0.6 × 105  (SF295), and 0.1 × 106 (MDA-MB435) cells/mL. Extracts  were tested in a single concentration (50 μg/mL) and  pure compounds in a range between 0.39 and 25 μg/mL  during 72 h. Control groups received the same amount  of vehicle and doxorubicin (Doxolem®, Zodiac Produtos  Farmacêuticos S/A, Brazil), which was used as a positive  control. Growth inhibition rates were quantiﬁed as the  percentage of control absorbance by the reduced dye at  550 nm in accordance with the following equation:   Inhibition rate = [(OD control well – OD treated  well) x (OD control well)-1] x 100.    Each sample was tested in two independent  experiments performed in triplicates. The results  consisted of the average value for each experimental unit.  The IC50 values and their 95% conﬁdence intervals were  obtained by non linear regression using the GraphPad  Prism program (Intuitive Software for Science, San  Diego, CA). An activity scale was utilized to appraise  the cytotoxic potential of the tested samples: inactive  samples (I), samples with low activity (LA, cell growth  inhibition between 1-50%), moderated activity (MA, cell  growth inhibition between 50-75%), and high activity  (HA, cell growth inhibition between 75-100%). Leishmanicidal assay   The L. braziliensis strain H3227 (MHOM/ BR/94/H-3227) used in this study was kindly provided by  Prof. Dr. Aldina Barral (Professor of Immunology, Centro  de Pesquisas Gonçalo Moniz, FIOCruz-Bahia, Brazil).  The parasites were maintained in vitro in M199 medium  (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) at 26 ºC supplemented with  10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 2% human urine,  20 mM HEPES, 4 mM NaHCO3, 10 U/mL of penicillin  and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (GIBCO).   The anti-promastigote assay was  carried  out according to the method of Dutta et al. (2005).  Beauvericin (2) was serially diluted from 0.02 to 10 µM  in Schneider's medium (supplemented with 10% FBS  and 2% human urine) containing 2 x 105 parasites/mL. A  total of 4 x 104 parasites were seeded per well in 96-well  microplates incubated at 26 °C until the end of the log  phase. After, 100 μg of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) dissolved in 10 μL  of PBS was added per well, and the plates were incubated  at 37 °C for 4 h. Following incubation, the plates were  centrifuged at 3000 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was  removed, and precipitated formazan was dissolved in 100  µL of dimethyl sulfoxide. The absorbance was measured  at 492 nm, and the data for two independent assays  performed in triplicate were analyzed by non-linear  regression with variable slope (Graph Pad Prism 5.0  software). The EC50 was deﬁned as the effective drug  concentration that inhibits parasite proliferation by 50%  compared with a non-treated culture. Geneticin (G418)  was used as a positive control (EC50 0.007 μM). Results and Discussion   Extracts obtained after fourteen days of  incubation of both endophytic fungi in liquid Czapek  medium did not show any relevant cytotoxic activity.  The best incubation time for production of cytotoxic  compounds was 21 days, in both liquid and solid media.  The most active extracts were found to be SS50-HxS and  SS46-EaL, which showed high cytotoxic activities against  the three cancer cell lines (Table 1). Extract SS46-EaS also  showed high activity against HCT-8 cells and moderate  activity against SF295 cells. Interestingly, F. oxysporum  SS46 produced bioactive ethyl acetate extracts in both  liquid and solid media. On the other hand, F. oxysporum  SS50 produced bioactive compounds of lower polarity  only in solid medium, as observed for the high activities  of SS50-HxS extract. In our previous investigation, F.  oxysporum SS46 had already produced high cytotoxic  ethyl acetate extracts; however no cytotoxic activity had  been detected for F. oxysporum SS50 (Gallo et al., 2009).  This result can be explained by the different extraction  methods, because in that previous screening all the fungal  solid cultures extracts were partitioned only with ethyl  acetate. Chemical investigation was focused on the most  active extracts: SS46-EaS, SS46-EaL and SS50-HxS.

The SS50-HxS extract was analyzed by GC-MS.  Twenty-seven components were detected in this extract,  and twelve of them (76.8%) were identiﬁed by the GC- MS data (Table 2). According to our results, there is a  predominance of alkanes and fatty acid methyl esters  in this extract and the main constituents are: (9Z,12Z)- octadecadienoic acid methyl ester (54.45%), methyl  hexadecanoate (9.73%) and (9Z)-octadecenoic acid methyl  ester (4.70%). Fifteen compounds remained unidentiﬁed  because the spectral data could not be associated with any  compound database system (Wiley lib 7). The analysis of  hexane rice-control extract (without fungus), showed that  there is little correlation in their chemical composition.  There are only ﬁve compounds in common in the extracts:  1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-methylpropyl) ester,  methyl hexadecanoate, (9Z)-octadecenoic acid methyl  ester, clionasterol and stigmast-4-en-3-one. Therefore,  seven compounds differentiate the SS50-HxS extract  from the culture medium control extract: (2E, 4E)- decadienal,  pentadecane,  hexadecane,  heptadecane  octadecane, (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid methyl ester  and dehydroergosterol. All extracts analyzed in this study  differed considerably in their secondary metabolites. The  SS50-HxS showed pronounced cytotoxicity against the  three human cancer cell lines. As the major components  of the hexane extract are a mixture of three methyl esters  (methyl hexadecanoate, (9Z)-octadecenoic acid methyl  ester and (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid methyl ester),  which represents 68.88% of the extract, presumably they  should be responsible for the high cytotoxic activity of  the crude extract. The culture medium control extract did  not show cytotoxic activity (Table 1). This extract also  contains a fatty acid methyl esters mixture, but a mixture  of two and only a lesser amount, methyl hexadecanoate  or methyl palmitate, (9Z)-octadecenoic acid methyl ester,  representing only 17.41% crude extract.

Previously reported data found that another  mixture of three fatty acid methyl esters (methyl  myristate, methyl palmitate and methyl stearate),  isolated from the ascidian Didemnum psammatodes,  also showed high cytotoxic activity and antiproliferative  effects against four cell lines leukemia. The mechanism  of action of these fatty acid methyl esters was found to  involve inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of  both necrosis and apoptosis (Takeara et al., 2008). The  major constituent of this mixture is the methyl palmitate  or methyl hexadecanoate, also identiﬁed as one of the  three constituents of the mixture of methyl esters present  in the SS50-HxS extract. Still according to the literature,  when each methyl ester blend was tested separately, the  cytotoxic activity decreased, suggesting that a synergistic  effect of the mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (Takeara  et al., 2008).   The SS46-EaS extract exhibited high cytotoxicity  against the colon cancer cells (84.82%) and moderate  cytotoxicity against central nervous system cancer cells  (67.02%) (Table 1). This extract was subjected to vacuum  liquid chromatography, and subsequent puriﬁcation of the  resulting fractions by chromatographic techniques resulted  Bioactive extracts and chemical constituents of two endophytic strains of  Fusarium oxysporum   Andréa M. do Nascimento et al.

The SS46-EaL extract showed the  higher cytotoxicities against the three human cancer cell  lines: colon (100.0 %), melanoma (99.32%) and central  nervous system (100.0%). The SS46-EaL extract was  fractionated by column chromatography resulting in  the isolation of compound 2.  Analysis of the 1H NMR,  13C NMR, HMQC and HMBC spectra, together with  HRESIMS data and comparison to literature data, led to the  identiﬁcation of compounds 1 and 2 as the naphthoquinone  anhydrofusarubin  and  the  cyclo-hexadepsipeptide  beauvericin, respectively (Kurobane et al., 1980; Zhan et  al, 2007). The occurrence of naphthoquinone 1 and cyclo- hexadepsipeptide 2 has been previously reported in the  genus Fusarium (Tatum & Baker, 1983). O O O OH OH H3CO O O N O O O N O O O N O 1 2 CH3     The cytotoxic activities of compounds 1 and 2  were evaluated in vitro against the three cancer cell lines.  Anhydrofusarubin (1) and beauvericin (2) presented  signiﬁcant cytotoxicity against all the evaluated cancer  cells, and the IC50 values ranged from 2.39 to 9.85 μg/ mL (Table 3). Anhydrofusarubin (1) was recently isolated  from a marine Fusarium sp. strain and showed selective  cytotoxicity against human oral carcinoma cell lines  (KB cells) and breast cancer (MCF-7) (Trisuwan et al.,  2010). It has been reported previously in the literature in  vitro cytotoxic activity of beauvericin (2), also isolated  from an endophytic F. oxysporum strain, in other cell  lines of human cancer (Zhan et al., 2007). Compound  2 is an ionophore able to transport cations across the  membranes, especially calcium, leading to the cytotoxic  effects (Zhan et al, 2007; Wang & Xu, 2012). As part of  our research interest in ﬁnding antiparasitic compounds,  beauvericin (2) was tested in vitro against promastigotes  of Leishmania braziliensis, and showed EC50 1.86 μM.  Therefore, compound 2 can be considered an interesting  leishmanicidal natural product for further structure  diversiﬁcation. Beauvericin (2) had already been reported  as a bioactive compound against other cancer lines, HIV1  virus and bacterial strains (Wang & Li, 2012). We now  report the activity of beauvericin against different cancer  lines and, for the ﬁrst time, against L. braziliensis.   This study demonstrated that strains of fungal  endophytes, identiﬁed as the same species and isolated  from the same plant tissue, may vary considerably in the  class of secondary metabolites produced. They may also  produce different compounds depending on culturing  conditions. F. oxysporum SS46 produced compound 1 in  solid medium, and the cyclo-hexadepsipeptide 2 in liquid  medium, both compounds extracted with ethyl acetate  after 21 days of fungal fermentation. These compounds  have important antiproliferative properties selective for  cancer cells that might explain the cytotoxicities observed  for the extracts. There was no production of these  compounds by F. oxysporum SS50, which synthesizes  predominantly fatty acid methyl esters and alkanes in  solid medium. Table 3.
