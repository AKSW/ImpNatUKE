Abstract-Anibu  rosaeodora  wood was shown to contain (-)-rubranine.  An optically inactive form of this citrylidene-  chalcone  was previously  considered  to be an artifact  of extraction.  The constitution  of rubranine  was confirmed  by  pyrolysis  and syntheses,  involving  previously  reported  pyridine-catalysed  condensation  of pinocembrin  and citral,  whereby  novel intermediates  were prepared,  and the acid-catalysed  condensation  of pinocembrin  with geraniol  followed  by oxidation.  INTRODUCTION  At the outset of the present studies on Lauraceae  species,  the presence  of an orange  product  in Aniba rosaeodora  Ducke was reported  [2]. Later named rubranine,its  struc-  tural elucidation  relied on spectral  data, complemented  by acid isomerization  la -+ 2a [3], 3 and 4 [4], as well as  syntheses  involving  pyridine-catalysed  condensation  of  citral and either phloroacetophenone  (followed by aldol  condensation  of the resulting  product  lc with benzalde-  hyde) [3, 51 or pinocembrin  (5a) at 160”. At 100” the  latter reaction  gives 6 and 7 which at 180” yields rubra-  nine  (la).  Spectral  evidence  being  incompatible  with  the existence  of unchelated  hydroxyl  and carbonyl  func-  tions. structure  8 cannot  represent  either of the interme-  diates, invalidating  structure  lb for rubranine  [6].  The distinction  between  la and lb is impossible  on  spectral  grounds  [3, 63. Even  acid isomerization,  on  which the original structural  proposal  la was based [3],  lost weight as a decisive argument  with the isolation  of  4. This was postulated  to arise from la by opening  of  both benzylic  ether bonds,  rotation  of 180” about  the  Ar-C  bond  and ring closure  [4]. The formation  of  compounds  2a and 3 could, of course,  be rationalized  through an analogous  sequence of events starting from lb.  With regard to acid isomerization,  it may be relevant  to mention  that rubranine  (la), as well as racemic pino-  cembrin  (5a) [8], were obtained  from rosewood  by a  process  [3]  which  involved  extraction  with  boiling  benzene  and repeated  washings  of the solution  with  dilute  HCl in order  to separate  anibine  (9a) [2]. The  rubranine  was found to be optically inactive and this fact,  as well as the absence of citral in the wood was explained  postulating  anibine-catalysed  scavenging  of citral  by  *Part 49 in the series ‘The chemistry  of Brazilian  Lauraceae’.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Prior  to examination  of the possibility  of artifact  formation  we wanted  to confirm  the structure  of our  (-)-rubranine.  An analytical  means  of differentiating  between  the structures  la and lb, an alternative  to acid  isomerization,  consists  of pyrolysis.  Lack of colour and  the UV spectrum  of the product  indicated  that  the  original  chalcone  chromophore  had been isomerised  to  a flavanone  type. In spite of its chromatographic  beha-  viour (one TLC spot) and sharp mp. the product  was a  ca 1 :l mixture  of two compounds,  both  showing  a  chelated  hydroxyl  (r -2.23,  - 2.19). The derivatives  were represented  as the linear isomers  2a and 2b, rather  than the angular  ones, on account  of a strongly  positive  Gibbs test [lo]. Although  this evidence is not completely  reliable, due to the possibility  of ring opening  under the  conditions  (pH 9.2) of the test, the presence  of both the  linear and the angular isomers in this mixture is unlikely,  in view of the sharpness  of the PMR signal of the lone  aromattc  proton.  Both derivatives,  2a and 2b, contain  vinylic methyls (z 8.1). No such groups, of course, could  be generated  from lb whose  pyrolysis  should  yield a  5-hydroxyflavanone  with an exocyclic vinyl group (12).  Confirmation  of this reasoning  was obtained  upon  hydrogenation  of the pyrolytic  product,  Again a mixture  of two compounds  resulted.  These, however,  could be  separated  by chromatography  on silica gel into a 5-hy-  droxyflavanone  (Zc) and a 2’,6’-dihydroxydihydrochal-  cone  (13). As expected  both  contain  one quaternary  (T 8.7, singlet) and two tertiary  (r 8.8 and 9.3, doublets)  methyls.  Hydrogenation  of 12 would have led to a com-  pound  possessing  one  tertiary  and  two  quaternary  methyls.  As already  pointed  out, however,  the safest means of  structural  confirmation  is the synthesis  of rubranine  by  condensation  of citral  with  pinocembrin  in pyridine.  517  PHYTO 1113-L  I.B.DE ALLELUIAC~ al.  la R’ = COSt,  R, = H  lb R’ = H.

Under conditions  described  for citral and phloroglucinol  [ll].  a product  resulted,  which  was fractionated  by  chromatography  on silica gel into  a 3:7 mixture  of  the flavanones  6 and 7 [IS]. a 10: 13 : 77 mixture  of the  novel chalcones  14% 14b and 15. and a product  which  was indistinguishable  from  natural  (-)-rubranine  by  TLC, mp. UV. IR, PMR and MS comparison.  The relative  proportion  of the flavanones  6 and 7 was determmed  by  measurement  of the integrated  intensities  of the respec-  tive signals  in the PMR  spectrum  of the mixture.  The  C-6 proton  of 6 and the chromene  protons  of 7, subject  to the paramagnetic  effect of the electron  current  in the  vicinal chelate  system. give rise to signals at lower field  than the C-8 proton  of 7 and the chromene  protons  of 6.  An analogous  effect is responsible  for the differences  in  chemical  shifts of the signals due to the lone aromatic  protons  and the chromene  protons  in the chalcones.

Consideration  of the intensities  of  the latter signals show that the major constituent  of the  chalcone  mixture is the dichromene  derivative  15, a con-  clusion which was confirmed  by MS.  Having  satisfied  ourselves  with respect  to the struc-  ture of (-)-rubranine.  experiments  were designed to show  the feasibility  of in rim  formation  of the citrylidene  system  via condensation  of geraniol  and  a phloro-  glucinol  ring. In spite of the mildness  of the chosen  conditions,  aqueous  citric  acid  [ 121, phloroglucinol  itself proved  unsatisfactory  as a model  substrate.  All  3 products,  16% 16b and 17a obtained  besides derivatives  of geraniol  [13]. showed  that the initial alkylating  step  had been followed by acid-catalysed  cyclization.  In order  to produce  the chromene  intermediate  of a citrylidene  system,  however,  oxidative  cyclization  of the geranyl-  phenol  is required.  The  tendency  for acid-catalysed  cyclization  can be diminished,  using the less reactive  phloroacetophenone  as substrate.  In this case. besides  the two cyclized derivatives  16c and 17b. geranylphloro-  acetophenone  (18) was obtained.

At room temperature  under  reported  conditions  [14],  we also succeeded  in separating  from the reaction  pro-  duct the isomeric  chromene,  14d and a mixture  of the  citrylidene  derivatives  lc and Id The components  of the  mixture  were identified  easily,  having  been  obtained  previously : lc (debenzylidenerubranine)  by alkaline  de-  gradation  of rubranine  [3] or by heating of 14c in pyridine  [4]. and ld by acid treatment  of 14~ [4]. The surprising  ease of production  of these citrylidene  derivatives,  either  during  the oxidation  reaction  of geranylphloroaceto-  phenone  proper  or during chromatographic  separation  of the products,  favours the opinion  that an analogous  process  may justify  the biosynthesis  of rubranine  (la)  from pinocembrin  (Sa).  Pinocembrin  (5a), for the final experiments.  was pre-  pared  from  cinnamoyl  chloride  and  phloroglucinol  according  to a process  [lS] which does not describe  the  3 side products  19a 19b [16] and 19c we obtained  in the  reaction.  Due to the slight solubility  of pinocembrin  in  water, attempts  at geranylation  in aqueous  citric acid  failed. In a solution  of TsOH in ethyl acetate,  however,  ‘O&Me  R30qoR2  18  19a R’ = CO%, RZ = R3 = H  19b R’ = RZ = COSt, R3 = H  19~ R’ = RZ = R3 = COSt  %geranylpinocembrin  (5b) and  6-geranylpinocembrin  (SC) were obtained  in a 2:l  proportion.  Oxidation  of  5b with DDQ  in benzene  at room  temperature  [14]  gave the expected  chromene  6, a proven intermediate  of  rubranine  synthesis  [6]. Acid treatment  of 6 was not  optimized  for obtaining  rubranine.  Under  the rather  vigorous  conditions  used, 3, the major product  of acid  isomerization  of rubranine  [3,4] was produced  directly.  In conflict  with the statement  that rubranine  is an  artifact [3] are the following observations  : (1) ( -)-rubra-  nine can be isolated  by washing  A. rosaeodora wood for  a few seconds  at room  temperature  with  hexene  or  benzene.  (2) Citral  does not accompany  linalool  and  geraniol  in A. rosaeodora. The same is true, however, for  A. duckei Kosterm.  [7], a species which, except for the  replacement  of pinocembrin  by cotoin  (10) [S] and the  absence of rubranine,  shows a very similar composition,  including  the presence  of anibine  [Z]. Thus, by analogy  with the reaction envisaged  for the biosynthesis  of deoxy-  bruceol  (11) [9], the formation  of rubranine  may also  involve condensation  of geranyl pyrophosphate,  or even  a linalool  derivative,  with a phloroglucinol  system  in  this case that of pinocembrin.  520  1 B LX ALLPLITA et uf.
