B. Smith & Ayensu, a species  occurring in Diamantina,  State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.  Chromatographic  fractionation  on silica gel of the  hexane extract of the stem, roots and leaf sheaths of K  caput-ardeae afforded two crystalline compounds, which  were shown to be two new kaurenes.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The molecular formula of 12/I-hydroxy-9,l l-dehydro-  kaurene  (1) CZOHJOO, was determined  by MS [M+  observed 286.2232 (68x),  requires 286.22961. The IR  spectrum revealed the presence bf hydroxyl(3 300 cm- ’ )  and terminal methylene (870 cm- ‘) groups. The ‘H NMR  spectrum showed signals for three tertiary methyl groups  (6 1.10, 0.92, 0.84), a carbinolic  proton  (3.95, lH, dd,  J = 4.0 and 3.5 Hz), a terminal methylene (5.05, lH, br s)  and (4.90, lH, br s) and trisubstituted double bond (6 5.30,  lH, br d). These data suggested a kaurene-type diterpene  structure for eompound  1.  OH  n  OH  I  *Part  12 in the series ‘The Chemistry  of S. American  Velloziaceae’. For Part 11 see Pinto, A.

Substance 1 was oxidized with pyridinium chlorochro-  mate which yielded an a&unsaturated  ketone (v,!$  1660 cm- ’ ; izatH 248 nm, log E 3.92) identical with ketone  2 isolated from the plant. Analysis of the ‘H NMR  spectrum of 2 showed downfield shifts for the protons of  the terminal methylene group and for the proton on the  trisubstituted double bond relative to the values observed  for substance 1 (Table 1).  The positions of the trisubstituted  double bond and  hydroxyl group, located at C-9,11 and C-12, respectively,  were deduced by comparison of the chemical shifts in the  ‘H NM.R spectra of 1 and 2 (Table 1) with the data  recorded for the other kaurene-type  diterpenes 3 and  4 [1 I.
