GOTTLIEB  Escola de Ws-Graduacilo,  Universidade  Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, c.p. 25, ZGOO,  Rio de Janeiro, Brasil  (Received 28 September 1971)  Plant. Dalbergia decipularis Rizz. and Matt.,2 trivial name ‘sebastiPo de arruda’, tree.  Source. Andarai, central Bahia, Brazil. Uses. The compact, fragrant heartwood has beautiful  pink streaks and is used for fine furniture and flooring.3  Heartwood. Extraction with benzene produced a solution which was filtered and con-  centrated under vacuum. Upon standing a precipitate appeared. This was separated by  filtration and crystallized from acetone giving (f)-3-hydroxy-9-methoxypterocarpan,  m.p.  and m.m.p. with an authentic sample,4 195-197”. The filtrate was evaporated and extracted  with boiling light petroleum. The soluble portion was an oil whose purification by distil-  lation under vacuum (98-99”, O-4 mm) gave practically pure nerolidol. The insoluble portion  was chromatographed  on silica, giving upon elution with benzene 3,9-dimethoxy-ptero-  carpda-en,  m.p. 115-116” (lit. m.p. 11O”,5 116”6); and with AcOEt (+)-3-hydroxy-9-  methoxypterocarpan,  m.p. and m.m.p. with an authentic sample,4 127-128”; 3,9dimethoxy-  6-oxopterocarp-6a-en,  m.p. 200-201” (subl.) (lit.’ m.p. 196-198”); and an aliphatic ester,  m.p. 245-247”, M-498. The identification  involved NMR, IR, UV and mass spectral  measurements. The base peak of the mass spectrum of 3,9-dimethoxy-6-oxopterocarp-6a-en  is associated with the loss of a methyl group.  Phytochemical comments. Nerolido17 and the pterocarpans4  were isolated previously  from other Dalbergiu species. The pterocarpens  have only recently been reported5 as  constituents  of Swartzia madagascariensis. Dalbergia decipularis seems thus chemically  closer to a species of the Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae  than indeed to its proper papilion-  aceous entourage.  Acknowledgements-The  authors are indebted to the Conselho National  de Pesquisas, Rio de Janeiro, for  8nancial aid, and to Professor W. D. Ollis, The University, Sheffield, for the mass spectra. Professor S. H.  Harper and Dr. W. G. E. Underwood,  University College of Rhodesia, Saliibury, kindly contributed  the IR  spectra of the pterocarpens.  * Part XXXVI in the series “The Chemistry of Brazilian Leguminosae”.
