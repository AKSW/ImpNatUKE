Abstract-Two  novel dihydrochalcones,  2’,3,4’,6’-tetrahydroxy-4-methoxy-3’,5-di-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-dihydrochal-  cone  and  2’,.3,6’-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-5-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-3’,4’-(2”,2”-dimethyldihydropyran)-dihydroch~cone,  have been isolated from fresh fruits of Metrodorea nigra. Stems and leaves showed a similar composition and we have  isolated common steroids, simple coumarins, several furocoumarins, furoquinoline  alkaloids and a furofuran lignan.  From stems, we have also isolated the pentacyclic 6-C-monoterpenyl-5,7-dioxycoumarin,  deoxybruceol. Structures of  the isolated compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectral data.  INTRODUCTION  The genus Metrodorea, belonging  to the tribe Cus-  parieae, is considered to contain ca eight species, which  are confined to Brazil [ 1,2]. There are, as yet, no reports  of any chemical studies on Metrodorea species. Thus, as  part of our ongoing phytochemical and chemotaxonomic  study on members of the Cusparieae, we have examined  fresh fruits, leaves and stems of M. nigra. This species,  commonly known as wild orange, is a small tree of l-2 m  high. We report here in the isolation and characterization  of two new dihydrochalcones,  along  with  known  coumarins, anthranilate  alkaloids, lignans and steroids.  RESULTSANDDISCUSSION  The fresh fruits of M. nigra were percolated with meth-  anol. The chloroform-soluble  fraction of the methanol  extract was concentrated  and subjected to VLC. Apolar  and polar fractions were composed mainly by triacyl  glycerols and condensed tannins, respectively. From the  medium polar fractions, after prep. TLC, we obtained  two novel C-prenylated  dihydrochalcones.  Compound  1 exhibited  similar  spectral  data  to 2’,4,4’,6’-tetra-  hydroxy-3,5-di-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-dihydr~halcone  (6),  which has previously been isolated from Boronia incon-  spicua (Rutaceae) 133. The ‘H NMR spectrum (Table l),  instead  of signals for meta-coupled  A-ring protons,  *Based in part on the doctorate thesis presented by the senior  author to the Universidade Federal de Sgo Carlos, SP, Brazil  (1994).  SAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed.  showed one 1H singlet at 6 5.80. This signal and the mass  spectral fragment at m/z 220 [C12H1204]+, due to fis-  sion of the propanone bridge between the C = 0 and the  C-a, established the presence of a 3,3-dimethylallyl group  at C-3’/C-5’. The signal at 65.80 was thus assigned to  H-S/H-3’. This was supported by comparison with the  spectral data published for 5,7,2’,4’-tetrahydroxy-6,5’-di-  (3,3-dimethylallyl)-flavanone,  isolated from Euchresta ja-  ponica (Leguminosae)  [4]. The ‘HNMR  also showed  a B-ring spin-system for 3,4,5_substitution, as in 6, and  a signal for a methoxyl group. However, for 1, H-6 (66.67)  was more deshielded than that at H-2 (66.54) and, in the  13C NMR spectrum, the deshielded position of the meth-  oxyl resonance at Sc61.2 (q) required an ortho-disub-  stituted carbon [5], thus placing the methoxyl substitu-  ent at C-4, the hydroxyl substituent  at C-3 and the  3,3_dimethylallyl substituent at C-5. This was corrobor-  ated by the mass fragment m/z 218 [C14HIs02]+.  Thus,  1 was identified as 2’,3,4’,6’-tetrahydroxy-4-methoxy-3’,5-  di-(3,3-dimethylallyI)-dihydrochalcone.  Compound  2 was isolated in small amounts.  The  ‘H NMR spectrum (Table 1) was similar to that of 1 for  the A and B-ring protons, consequently, the same substi-  tution pattern was deduced for 2. However, the ‘H NMR  spectrum also indicated the presence of one 2,2-dimethyl-  dihydropyran  ring (61.36, 6H, s; 1.80, 2H, t, J = 6.6 Hz  and 2.58, 2H, t, .I = 6.6 Hz). These observations  can be  explained only by the presence of a 2,2_dimethyldihyd-  ropyran ring between C-3’ and O-4’. This was confirmed  by the mass fragment at m/z 220 (C12HI,0,]  + as found  in 1. Thus, 2 was identified  as 2’,3,6’-trihydroxy-4-  methoxy-5-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-3’,4’-(~,~-dimethyldihyd-  ropyran)-dihydrochalcone.  However, compound 2 could  be an artefact formed from 1 during isolation.  1797  1798  A. H.

The  hexane and chloroform extracts, and the chloroform-sol-  uble fractions of the methanol extracts, were investigated.  From the leaves, we isolated the coumarins, limetin [6],  aurapten [7], 8-methoxylimetin  [S], bergapten [9], xan-  totoxin [lo], isopimpinellin and isoimperatorin  [ 111, the  furoquinoline  alkaloid, skimmianine  [ 121, the furofuran  lignan, eudesmin [13] and a mixture of /?-sitosterol and  stigmasterol. From the stems we isolated the coumarins,  limetin,  aurapten,  8-methoxylimetin,  bergapten,  xan-  totoxin,  isopimpinellin,  imperatorin  [ 111, scopoletin  [14], umbelliferone  1143, isogospherol  (3) [lS]  and  deoxybruceol  (4) [16-181, the furoquinoline  alkaloid,  skimmianine,  the secofuroquinoline  alkaloids, E- and  Z-dimethylrhoifolinate  (5) [19]. and a mixture of /I-sitos-  terol and stigmasterol. These compounds were identified  by comparison of their spectral data with those reported  in the literature.  Isogospherol  (3), a &modified  O-  prenylated linear furocoumarin  previously isolated from  Prungos lophopteru (Umbelliferae) [lS], does not appear  to have previously been recorded from the Rutaceae.  Also, this appears to be the first record of deoxybruceol  (4), a pentacyclic 6-C-monoterpenyl-5,7-dioxycoumarin,  from the tribe Cusparieae, but it has been reported from  Eriostemon  brucei (tribe Boronieae) [16, 173. The fu-  roquinoline alkaloids, Z- and E-dimethylrhoifolinate  (S),  have been reported previously by us from another Braz-  qlQo  9  i-  3  \ OH  ?Me  \  OMe  s  ilian species of the Rutaceae, Zanthoxylum  rhoifolium  [19]. The range of compounds we have isolated from M.  nigra reinforces its position as a member of the Rutaceae  c201.  EXPERIMENTAL  General. Mps uncorr. UV and IR were recorded in  MeOH and CHCIJ, respectively.  ‘H and i3CNMR  spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively,  in CDC13 with TMS as int. standard. EIMS were ob-  tained at 70 eV (probe).  Pht  material. Metrodorea  nigru St. Hil. was collected  in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in April 1984. A voucher  specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto  Agronomico de Campinas, SP, Brazil.  Extraction  and isolation.  Fresh fruits (110 g) were  chopped into small pieces and percolated with MeOH.  The residue was dried and extracted with CHC13 at room  temp. This extract (2.5 g) was shown to be composed of  satd hydrocarbons  and triacylglycerols. The MeOH ex-  tract (10 g) was suspended in 50% aq.
