Abstract-Two  novel types of natural peltogynoids  represented  by the flavanones (Vb), (Ve) and (Vg) and  the chalcone (VIc) were encountered  during the examination of the heartwood constituents of Goniorrhachis  marginata Taub.  INTRODUCTION  Goniorrhachis marginatu Taub., known in Brasil by the trivial name guarabd, belongs to a  monotypic genus of the Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae  which is closely akin to Peltogyne.2  In the present paper we wish to report on the structure of four crystalline constituents of its  heartwood. As had been anticipated, they are peltogynoids. The types of known natural  products associated with the peltogynane skeleton (I)3 are represented by compounds which  can be formally related to anthocyanidin  (II), 4a flavan-3,4-diol (III),4 flavonol (IV)48*5  and dihydroflavonol  (V).6*7 In a similar way, the new compounds contain either flava-  none (Vb, Ve, Vg) or chalcone (VIc) nuclei.

REGO DE SOUSA  The first compound,  C,GH,09(OH),0Me,  showed spectral characteristics  (A,,, 286 run,  E 20 500) suggestive  of a flavanone  or a 3-hydroxyflavanone  constitution.8v9  Indeed,  upon  addition  of base, the intense  absorption  maximum  (AmaX 330 nm, E 30 400) typical  of the  chalcone  chromophore  appeared.  No hydroxyl  being present at C-5 (absence  of a UV-shift  upon  addition  of AICl,-HCI),  such a group  must be located  at C-7; acetylation  of the  compound  resulted  in the shift of the IR-carbonyl  absorption  from  1675 to 1700 cm-‘.  The PMR spectrum  of the acetate (Vd, Table 1) lacked a signal at characteristically  low field,  precluding  the existence also of hydrogen  on C-5. It became imperative,  therefore,  to locate  the methoxyl  at this position.  The analysis  of the ring A of the flavanone  was thus complete,  since the PMR-spectrum  indicated  the presence  of a pair of meta-related  aromatic  protons  (T 3.46 and 3.62, doublets,  J 2.0 Hz) which cannot  be located  on ring C (see below).

The PMR signals due to this and the remaining  benzenoid  proton  are substantially  singlets,  a fact which defines their para-relationship.  The constitutional  proposal  (Vb), which thus emerged  for this compound,  was con-  firmed, if only with respect to skeleton  and oxygenation  pattern,  by transformation  of its  trimethyl  ether (Vc) into the chalcone  Via. This was fully characterized  by analysis  of its  PMR  spectrum  (Table  2), KMnO,  oxidation  to 2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxybenzoic  acid,  and Me,SO,-K&O,  methylation  to a monomethyl  ether (VIb).  8 T.

Peltogynoids  of Goniorrhachis marginata  2843  Comparison of the spectral data of Vb with those of the second and third Goniorrhachis  compounds  led to constitutional  proposals also for them. Indeed the only significant  difference  in ‘the spectra of the triacetates  of Vb and Ve, i.e. Vd and C16H803  (OAc),OMe (Vf, Table l), refers to the PMR-signals due to the two aromatic protons on  ring-C. Benzylic coupling of the proton at C-2 to the proton at the 2’-position is still  observed in the derivative of Ve. The 2’-H signal is here, however, substantially a doublet  (J 8.5 Hz), indicating the vicinal relationship of the two protons on ring C, and leading  to the constitution  Ve for the second flavanone.

In contradistinction,  the only significant difference in the PMR spectra of the triacetates  of Vb and Vg, i.e. Vd and C16H903 (OAc), (Vi, Table l), refers to the signals due to the  substituents of ring A. In the derivative of the third flavanone, the methoxyl of Vb is clearly  replaced by an additional aromatic proton. The chemical shift and multiplicity (T 1.95, dd,  J 8.5 and 2-O Hz) of its PMR signal places it at the deprotected 5-position, ortho and para  related with the two other protons of ring A, leading to the constitution Vg for the third  flavanone. In confirmation  of this, Me2S04-K,C03  methylation  gave a trimethyl ether  2844  0. R. GO~~LIEB and J.

(+)-Tri-O-methyl-  peltogynone  (Vh) and (+)-tri-0-methylmopanone  (Vk) were also helpful in the assignment  of the absolute  configurations  (2R,3R)  to the new flavanones.

The similarity  of the curves of Vh and Vk indi-  cates that the differences  in substitution  pattern  do not invalidate  stereochemical  assign-  ments based on the comparison  of ORD-curves  in this field.

Peltogynoids  of Goniorrhachis  marginata  2845  and flavanones are considered primitive characters, while absence of the Shydroxyl  group  constitutes an advanced character. Both these criteria point to Goniorrhachis as a remnant  of the previously possibly widespread ancestors to Peltogyne and related genera.  EXPERIMENTAL  M.ps were determined using a Kofler hot stage microscope and are uncorrected.  Separations were carried  out using either Merck Kieselgel 0.05-0.20 mm (column chromatography)  or Merck Kieselgel G (TLC)  PMR spectra were determined using Varian instruments.

The powdered heartwood  (4.6 kg) was succes-  sively extracted with benzene and EtOH. The EtOH solution was evaporated  and the residue (400 g) was  chromatographed  on silica, yielding the following useful fractions with the indicated eluants: F1 (CHCls-  MeOH 98 :2), Fz (CHCl,-MeOH  98:3), FB (CHCl,-MeOH  98:6), Fq (CHCl,-MeOH  98 :7). Upon slow  evaporation  of the solvent, F1 gave crystals which were filtered and rechromatographed  on silica. Upon  slow evaporation  of the fraction eluted with CHC13-MeOH 98 :2, crystals aupeared. These were collected  by filtration and washed with CHC13, giving VIc (300 mg). F2 was evaporated iid the residue was rechroma-  tographed  on silica,  using  CHCIJ-MeOH  97:3 as eluant.  Evaporation  of the solvent  produced  Vg (500 mg). Fa and Fb were evaporated.  The residues were washed with MeOH and recrystallized  from MeOH, giving respectively Vb (400 mg) and Ve (100 mg).

To an acetone soln of Via (50 mg) solid KMnO, was added in small portions until per-  sistence of the violet colour. Excess KMn04 was destroyed with NaHS03. The acetone was evaporated and  the residue taken up with 5 % NaZCOA aq. The filtered aqueous solution was acidified with HCl and extracted  with CHCI,. The CHCl,-solution,  washed with water, dried and evaporated, gave 2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxy-  benzoic acid (8 mg), needles, m.p. 153-155” (MeOH) [lit.13 m.p. 1~52-154~1. ~2:; 3200, 1675, 1625, 1600,  1440, 1350, 1280, 1210, 1110,1040,925,840,  820, 780, 750, 690.

The chalcone  VIc (100 mg) was dissolved  in EtOH-HZ0  1: 1 (400 ml). HCI cont.  (20 ml) was added and the solution maintained  under reflux until the yellow colour had been nearly dis-  charged. The EtOH was evaporated. After cooling to room temp. andsaturation  with NaCl, was the solution  extracted with AcOEt. The organic layer was separated and dried. Evaporation  of the solvent gave a residue  which was chromatographed  on silica.
