Their structures  were established as l-hydroxy-2,3,5,6-tetramethoxy-9-acridone  for 1 and 1,2,3,5,6-pen-  tamethoxy-9-acridone for 2 by means of spectroscopic studies, in particular nmr. These struc-  tural assignments were confirmed by synthesis, using a direct metallation method as a key reac-  tion. Both alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against an aquatic snail, B i a -   phalaria glabratu, and cytotoxicity against several types of carcinoma cell lines.  We have recently described the isolation of various alkloids from Brazilian Rutace-  ous plants: two molluscicidal quinoline alkaloids from the leaves of Gafipeu brarteata  (l), and two insect-growth-inhibitory 4-quinolinone alkaloids from the leaves of Esen-  hkia feiocarpa (2). In our continuing search for biologically active phytochemicals, two  novel acridone alkaloids have been isolated from the leaves of another Brazilian Rutace-  ous plant, Angosturapanicufata (Engler) Elias. These alkaloids exhibited moderate mol-  luscicidal and cytotoxic activities and were designated cuspanine El} and cusculine [21.  Their structures were established based largely on nmr studies. However, the structures  established are rather uncommon among the known acridone alkaloids. Therefore, in  order to confirm the structures, their syntheses were carried out. This paper reports the  isolation, structure determination, and syntheses of 1 and 2.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  After repeated and various column chromatographies, the CH,Cl, extract of the  leaves ofA. panicufata yielded two new acridone alkaloids, cuspanine [I] and cusculine  121. In conjunction with both 'H- and ',C-nmr and eims data, the molecular formula  C1,Hl,NO6 was assigned to cuspanine 111. In addition, together with the uv and ir  data, an acridone-type structure could be assigned to cuspanine. This was apparent be-  cause keto group signals, characteristic of acridone at 6 181.14 (s) and 1635 cm-',  were observed. The presence of a free phenolic group was deduced from the uv spectrum  by using AICI, as the shift reagent. Thus, when afew drops ofAIC1, solution was added  to cuspanine in MeOH, a typical bathochromic shift was observed. However, the re-  gion of 3000-3600 cm-' in the ir spectrum showed only weak and broad absorption,  because the phenolic group forms a stable 6-membered ring intramolecular hydrogen  bond with the keto group. The 'H-nmr spectrum of 1 showed two aromatic proton sig-  nals at 6 6.92 and 8.06 ( J =  8.0 Hz for each) which can be attributed to H-7 and H-8,  respectively (3). This indicated the tetrasubstituted nature of ring C. The remaining  signal at 6 6.23 (s) could be attributed to the aromatic proton at either H-2 or H-4.  This was confirmed by 'H nmr using nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy  (NOESY). In the NOESY spectrum of cuspanine, an nOe was observed between the  aromatic proton H-4 at 6 6.23 and the amine proton at 6 8.44. This result, itself, was  conclusive for the assignment of the remaining proton to the 4 position in ring C.

Therefore, the structure 1 was proposed for cuspanine.  Cusculine E21 is very closely related to cuspanine Ill. The only difference observed  in the 'H-nmr  spectrum was an additional peak for an M e 0  group, suggesting the pres-  ence of five M e 0  groups in the molecule. In addition to this observation, the batho-  chromic shift observed in the uv spectrum of 1 was not detected with 2, indicating that  an Me0 group was substituted for the phenolic group of 1. This was further supported  by the 13C-nmr spectrum which showed three signals in lower field at 6 61.89,  61.53,  and 60.94, indicating the presence of three hindered Me0 groups (4) and leading to  structure 2 for cusculine.  Cuspanine 121, 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acridone,  was synthesized from 2-  bromo-3,Cdimethoxybenzoic acid [6]. The first method that was tried for the prepara-  tion of 6 was the bromination of isovanillin in refluxing CHCI,, followed by methyla-  tion (Me,S04) and oxidation (Jones' reagent). However, the bromination gave a poor  yield (18%), so the following alternate approach, using a directed metallation method,  was adopted.  1114  Journal of Natural Products  Wol. 55, No. 8  The methoxymethyl ether (MOM ether) 141, prepared from 3,4dimethoxybenzyl  alcohol [3] and methoxymethyl chloride, was lithiated in Et,O with n-butyllithium at  0". The resulting yellow precipitates were treated with 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane (5)  at -78',  and the mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature to give a bromide  5 with a 66% yield. Hydrolysis of the MOM ether of 5 with HBr in warm EtOH, fol-  lowed by oxidation with Jones' reagent, gave 6 in a 69% yield. Ullmann condensation  (6) of 6 and 3,4,5-trimethoxyaniline [7l in the presence of freshly prepared copper  powder and K,C03 in DMF gave 8 with a 56% yield appearing as orange plates. Treat-  ment of 8 with polyphosphoric acid and xylene (7) at 150' gave 2 in the form of yellow  prisms with a yield of 55%. Selective hydrolysis of the 1-MeO group of 2 was achieved  by refluxing in MeOH with concentrated HCl and 70% HC104 to afford 1 (Scheme 1).  The physical data for both 1 and 2 were identical with those of the natural products.  The structure of 1 was unambiguously determined by a single crystal X-ray analysis  (Figure 1).  FIGURE 1. Molecular structure of 1,2,3,5,6-pentamethoxy-9-acri-  done [Z] from X-ray crystallography.  Both alkaloids exhibited moderate molluscicidal activity against the aquatic snail  Bimphakaria gkbrata. The LC5, of cuspanine fl]  was 5 ppm and that of cusculine 121  was 20 ppm. There are only a few examples in the literature (8,9) where alkaloids  exhibiting high toxicity to snails are observed. These two alkaloids also showed  moderate cytotoxic activity against several carcinoma cell lines. The IC5,'s of 1 and 2  against HeIa epithelioid carcinoma cells were 2.5 and 8.5 pg/ml, respectively. In  addition, they also inhibited the growth of BT-20 human breast carcinoma cells.  EXPERIMENTAL  GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.-AII the pnxedures were the same as previously de-  scribed (2).  ISOLATION OF CONSTITUENTs.-The  leaves ofA. pnicvhtu were collected in Minas erais, Brazil,  in February 1988, and identified by Dr. Jd  R. Pirani, Instituto de BiociEncias, Universidade de So  Paulo, So Paulo, SP. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium ofthis institute. The dried pul-  verized leaves were first extracted with CH2C12 followed by MeOH at ambient temperature. A subsequent  molluscicidal bioassay using B .  gkzbrata indicated the CH2CI, extract to be active. The CH2CI, extract  (2.983 g) was chromatographed over Si gel, using CH,CI,, EtOAc, and MeOH. This process yielded 11  fractions. The bioactive fraction, eluted with EtOAc, was rechromatographed over Si gel (Lichroprep), af-  fording c u s p i n e  [l] (60 mg). The fractions eluted with MeOH after the same procedure gave cusculine  121 (200 mg).

CELL LINES  AND MEDIA.-AII cell lines used for the assay were purchased from American Type Cul-  ture Collection (Rockville, MD). They are HeLa ATCC CCL 2 19, epithelioid cerevix carcinoma from  human, and BT-20 ATCC HTB 19, breast carcinoma from human. Both cell lines were maintained on  minimum essential medium (Eagle) with non-essential amino acids supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-in-  activated fetal calf serum, and incubated in a humidified atomosphere of 5% C02-95% air at 37".

CYTOTOXICITY ASSAY.-The  cytotoxicity assays were performed by a microculture tetrazolium  (h4YY) (Sigma) method (12). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated into 96-well microtitre plates at  4@304000 celldwell, with various concentrations ofthe samples. After incubation, 50 pl MlT(3 mglml  in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The formazan dye ws solubilized by adding 100 pl DMSO to each well, fol-  lowed by gentle shaking. The extinction ccef6cient was measured for each well using a Uniskan I Photome-  ter Labsystems, at a wavelength of 620 run.  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  We thank Dr. Jd R.
