(Rutaceae) levou ao  isolamento de alcalóides furoquinolínicos (dictamina, g-fagarina e esquimianina) e 2-arilquinolin- 4-ona (2-fenil-1-metilquinolin-4-ona) e limonóides (ácido limonéxico e limonina). Os compostos  2-fenil-1-metilquinolin-4-ona e ácido limonéxico foram isolados pela primeira vez no gênero  Spiranthera. Os alcalóides furoquinolínicos, 2-arilquinolin-4-ona e os limonóides mostraram  atividade inseticida e/ou fungicida no ninho da formiga Atta sexdens rubropilosa. The study of the Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil (Rutaceae) branches extracts led to the  isolation of the furoquinoline (dictamine, g-fagarine and skimmianine) and 2-arylquinoli-4-one  (1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one) alkaloids and limonoids (limonexic acid and limonin). The  compounds 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one and limonexic acid were isolated for the first time  from the Spiranthera. These furoquinoline and 2-arylquinoli-4-one alkaloids and limonoids showed  insecticidal and/or fungicidal activity in the nest of the Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Keywords: Spiranthera odoratissima, furoquinoline alkaloids, limonoids, Atta sexdens  rubropilosa, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus Introduction Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil. (Rutaceae), popularly  know as Manacá, is a shrub found in the savannah and  forest of Central Brazil, and in Bolivia.1 In folk medicine  is used in the treatment of rheumatism, gout, kidney  infections, urinary retention, abdominal pains, acne and  boil.2 According to Matos et al.,3 the ethanolic extract of  the S. odoratissima roots contain compounds with analgesic  and anti-inflammatory activity. In previous phytochemical studies of S. odoratissima  roots and leaves were reported to contain furoquinoline and  b-indoloquinazoline alkaloids, coumarin, terpene, steroid  and limonoids.4-5 Leaf-cutting ants (Hymenoptera) are dominant herbivores  in the tropics and can be found from the United States   Southern to Northern Argentina countries.6 They cultivate a  symbiotic fungus for feeding using leaf fragments as substrate,  thus they are considering plague.7 Therefore, the biological  control of these insects has been the aim of many studies. In this work was determined the toxicity of crude extract  and compounds isolated from S. odoratissima branches in  nest of the Atta sexdens rubropilosa.  Experimental General experimental procedures The 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D correlations spectra  were obtained using Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, with  CDCl3 and acetone-d6 using TMS as internal standard. Terezan et al. 883 Vol. 21, No. 5, 2010 For ESIMS analysis, low resolution, was used on triple  quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC instrument. GC/MS (EI)  analysis was used a QP5000 Shimadzu, capillary column DB  5MS (30 m, 0.25 mm id, film 0.25 mm). The temperature was  programmed initially at 70 °C for 4 min, them increased with  a rate of 10 °C min-1 to 280 °C respectively, injection volume  was 1 mL in a split mode and temperatures of the detector/ injector were 300 /280 °C. The mass selective detector at  70 eV with scans from 50 to 500 u. Plant material Branches of S. odoratissima were collected in Rio  Verde-Jataí, GO, Brazil in January/2001 and identified by  Dr. José Rubens Pirani. Voucher specimens (4778) were  deposited at the Institute of Bioscience herbarium of the  University of São Paulo. Compounds extraction and isolation  The dried and powdered branches (1.1 kg) were  subsequently extracted with n-hexane (1.9 g), CH2Cl2  (7.2 g) and MeOH (16.7 g). The concentrated CH2Cl2  extract was submitted to vacuum chromatography over  silica gel (70-230 mesh) using a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc- MeOH gradient. The CH2Cl2-EtOAc fraction (4.1 g) was  chromatographed on silica gel (230-400 mesh), eluting  with a n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient to give  3 fractions A-C. Fraction A (34.4 mg) was fractionated as  above, n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc gradient. The fraction A-1  (15.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using n-hexane- CH2Cl2 (1:4) yielding 1 (7.8 mg). Fraction B (689.3 mg)  was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH  gradient yielding 26 fractions. The fraction B-15 (37.0 mg)  was purified by preparative TLC using n-hexane-CH2Cl2  (1:4) yielding 2 (8.7 mg). Fraction B-16 (210.1 mg) was  fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (3.5:6:0.5)  and yielded 32 fractions. The fraction B-16.27 (44.5 mg)  was purified by preparative TLC using hexane-CH2Cl2- acetone (0.5:4:0.5) yielding 3 (7.4 mg). Fraction C (2.1  g)  was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH  gradient, yielding 70 fractions. The fraction C-34  (397.5 mg) was fractionated using n-hexane-CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH gradient and fraction C-34.86 was purified  by preparative TLC using CH2Cl2-acetone (4:1) and yielded  4 (18.0 mg). Fraction C-67 (40.4 mg) was fractionated  by TLC using CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:3) yielding 5 (5.0 mg).  The concentrated MeOH extract was submitted to liquid  partition with n-hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. The  union of the n-hexane and CH2Cl2 fractions (510.0 mg)  was chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 eluting with  MeOH, MeOH-CH2Cl2 (4:1, 3:2 and 1:1) to give 38 frations.  Fraction 22 (89.0 mg) was submitted to centrifugational  chromatography (Cromatroton) using n-hexane-CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH gradient, yielding 10 fractions. Fraction  22-2 (20.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC using  n-hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (1:8:1) and yielded 6 (16.0 mg). Identification of the isolated compounds The isolated compounds were identified using NMR,  MS techniques. The furoquinoline alkaloids, dictamine  (1), g-fagarine (2) and skimmianine (3) presented spectral  data in agreement with the literature.8-9 1-Methyl-2- phenylquinolin-4-one (4)10: Amorphous solid, EIMS m/z  (rel. int. %) [M+] 235 (100), 207 (71), 178 (6), 165 (11),  102 (19), 89 (9), 77 (17), 51 (11). Limonexic acid (5)11:  Amorphous solid. ESIMS, m/z (rel. int. %): 501 [M-H]−  (100). Limonin (6)11: white solid, mp 295-299 °C; ESIMS,  m/z (rel. int. %): 469 [M-H]− (100).  Fungicidal bioassay The fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Singer)  Möller (syn Rozites gongylophorus) was isolated from an  Atta sexdens rubropilosa laboratory nest. The medium for fungus maintenance and methods  for the bioassays were previously described.12 Solvent  (n-hexane or dichloromethane or methanol) or solution of  each extract or solution of compounds (1.0 mL) were added  to 9.0 mL of culture medium composed of (g L-1): glucose  (10.0), sodium chloride (5.0), peptone (5.0), malt extract  (10.0) and agar (15.0). Control tubes received 1.0 mL of  solvent and 9.0 mL of medium. After the addition, the tubes  were autoclaved at 121 °C by 15 min and then slanted.  The final concentration of n-hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH  extracts were 1000 µg mL-1 and of the compounds 1, 2 and  3 were 50 µg mL-1. The fungal suspension was prepared  by transferring aseptically pieces of the mycelia (obtained  from 1-month-old culture growing in slant culture) to an   all-glass tissue grinder containing sterile peptone (1.0 g L-1)  and gently fragmented. This suspension (1.0 mL) was  spread onto the surface of the agar slant and incubated at  25 (±1) °C for 30 days. The assays were run twice (two  sets of five tubes each). Fungal growth was estimated  macroscopically on the basis of the mycelial surface and  density using the modal value. Leaf-cutting ant insecticide biossay The A. sexdens rubropilosa workers used in the assays  were randomly removed from laboratory nests. They had  Activities of Extracts and Compounds from Spiranthera odoratissima St. Hil. (Rutaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 884 a body mass of 20-25 mg. Before the assays the nests  were supplied daily with leaves of Eucalyptus sp., oat  seeds and occasionally with leaves of other plants such  as Hibiscus sp., Ligustrum sp. or rose petals. Fifty ants  were removed from the nests and put into five Petri dishes  (ten ants each) for each treatment. During the assay the  ants were maintained on an artificial diet prepared with  glucose (50.0 g L-1), bacto-peptone (10.0 g L-1), yeast  extract (1.0 g L-1), and agar (15.0 g L-1), in distilled water  (100 mL).13 The diet (0.4-0.5 g per dish) with the addition of  compounds (experiment) or without (control) were offered  daily in a small plastic cap. The control was prepared  with the diet and the solvent. To ensure that undetectable  remaining amounts of the solvent did not affect the ants,  a comparison made with another set of dishes in which  water was used instead of solvent. As expected, the same  survival rates were obtained with both systems (data not  shown). The compounds were poured into the hot diet  immediately after it was autoclaved. The final concentration  of the extracts added to the diet were 2000 mg mL-1 and  of the compounds 100 mg mL-1 or 500 mg mL-1. During  the assays the material was maintained in an incubator at  a temperature 25 (±1) °C and relative humidity ranging  between 70-80%. The maximum length of observation  was 25 days and number of dead ants was registered daily. The survival median 50% (S50) was calculated and  survival curves were compared by the computer-assisted  software Graph-Pad™ using the log-rank test. Results and Discussion The compounds isolated from dichloromethane crude  extract of the S. odoratissima branches were dictamine8  (1), g-fagarine9 (2), skimmianine8 (3), 1-methyl-2- phenylquinolin-4-one (4), limonexic acid (5) and limonin  (6) (Figure 1). The 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (4)  and limonexic acid (5) were isolated for the first time from  the Spiranthera.  Compounds 1-3 were identified by comparison of NMR  spectral data with those described in the literature,8,9 and  the structures of compounds 4, 5 and 6 were confirmed  on the basis of 1H NMR, EIMS and ESIMS spectra, and  carbon attributions that were made by HSQC and HMBC  correlation spectra.  The S. odoratissima branches crude extracts showed  high inhibitory activity on L. gongylophorus growth  and dichloromethane and methanolic extracts present  insecticidal activity on A. sexdens rubropilosa ants.  The n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol crude  extract (1000 mg mL-1) showed 100% of inhibitory activity  on symbiotic fungus (L. gongylophorus). The activities of  compounds 1-3 were comparable to those of extracts above.  However, 1 and 2 were more fungicide than 3, the two first  inhibiting fungus growths at 100% and the later 80%. The  compounds 4, 5 and 6, were not tested in this bioassay.  These results suggest that the furoquinoline alkaloids are  the potentially active compounds in the fungicidal bioassay  of dichloromethane crude extract. The fungicidal activity  of furoquinoline alkaloids skimmianine, kokusaginine,  maculine, dictamine, flindersiamine and quinolone obtained  from Rutaceae family,10,14 already had been described in  literature as powerful inhibitors of symbiotic fungus growth. The n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanolic extracts  were tested in ants (A. sexdens rubropilosa) ingestion  bioassay (Table 1) and dichloromethane and methanolic  extracts present insecticidal activity. In contrast with high  fungicidal activity of furoquinoline alkaloids against the  symbiotic fungus of the leaf-cutting ants, the ingestion  bioassay showed that compounds 1 and 2 showed weak  activity in ants ingestion assay, which had S50 ranging from  11.0 and 14.0, respectively, while in the control S50 was  15.0. Only compound 1 presented statistic difference in  comparison with control (Table 2), according to the log- rank test (p < 0.05), which considered all tested period.  Compound 3 was tested in previous work15 and showed not  be toxic to the leaf-cutting ants. Compounds 4-6 isolated  from dichloromethane and methanolic extracts showed  toxicity against leaf-cutting ants (Table 3). The ants survival  median (S50) were in the 7th and 4th day of the experiment,  respectively, compared with the control (S50 = 12 days) for  Figure 1. Molecular structures of the compounds isolated from  S. odoratissima branches extracts: 1: dictamine, 2: g-fagarine,  3: skimmianine, 4: 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one, 5: limonexic acid  and 6: limonin. Terezan et al. 885 Vol. 21, No. 5, 2010 1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-one (4) and limonin (6) in  concentration of 500 mg mL-1. For limonexic acid (5), the  most potent compound, at concentration of 500 mg mL-1, the  survival median (S50) of the ants were in the 3rd day of the  experiment and 98% mortality occurred at the 17th day. This  latter result was also observed by Biavatti et al.16 Therefore,  these results indicate that the compounds 4-6 are potentially  active compounds against A. sexdens rubropilosa. The potential insecticidal and fungicidal activities of  the S. odoratissima extracts and of the compounds isolated  from the dichloromethane and methanolic extracts suggest  the use of this plant in the nest of the leaf-cutting ants  control, and the continuation of the investigation of the  S. odoratissima bioactive compounds.
