C. robustum Mart.  was found to contain piceataunol, (-)-ccntrolobine (VIIa), (-)-de-O-xnethyhxntrolobiie (VIIb) and (-)-  centrolobol (VI). C. tomentosum Bed.  was found to contain (+)-centrolobine (IXa), (+)daO-methylcentro-  lobine (IXb) and (+)-centrolob~l (VIII).  THE TRUNK wood of Centrolobium  robusturn Mart. contains the antibiotic, centrolobine.2  Its structure (Ia) is known through the work of Marini-l3etti)Io and associates,3 who synthes-  ized the racemates of 0-methylcentrolobine  (Ib)3 and of centrolobine.4  The absolute con-  figuration of the two asymmetric centres of centrolobine, however, remained to.be established.  In the quest for a sample of centrolobine, needed to accomplish this objective, the heartwood  of C. robustum was re-examined.

Piceatannol was isolated previously from the heartwood of  Vouacapoua macropetala Aubl. and V. americana Aubl.,’ other South American species of  the Leguminosae.  The i.r. and NMR spectra of a second substance were identical to the corresponding  spectra which had been published for centrolobine. 3 Co-chromatography  with a sample of  centrolobine, obtained during the previous study of C. robusturn, using a number of solvents  for development, led to a single spot in all cases. Nevertheless, whereas the m.ps of the old  and the new isolates were identical, the mixed m.p. was considerably depressed. This fact  suggested immediately examination of the optical rotation of both samples, and, indeed, the  sample of centrolobine isolated in the previous study ([a]?’ +97”)3 gives rise, in the 600-400  nm region in MeOH solution, to a plain positive o.r.d. curve, whereas the sample isolated  in the present study ([alAs -97.6) gives rise to a plain negative o.r.d. curve. The optical  activity of the centrolobines is caused by two asymmetric centres, including one directly  attached to an aromatic ring. An examination of the c.d. data showed that the expected  Cotton effects,6 associated with the two electronic transitions in the 3W200 nm region of  this aromatic chromophore,  are both negative in (-)-centrolobine.  Upon comparison with the analogous spectra of (-)-centrolobine,  the i.r., u.v., NMR and  o.r.d. curves indicated the structure of (-)-de-0-methylcentrolobine  (Ic) for the third  substance isolated. This proposal was confirmed by conversion of both compounds (Ia and  Ic) to the common derivative (-)-0-methylcentrolobine  (Ib).  More interesting was the fourth compound, designated centrolobol.  Its close structural  relation to the centrolobines was revealed by the U.V. spectrum, practically superimposable  on the analogous spectrum of Ic. The mass spectrum, however, showed the molecular ion  peak at two more mass units than would be expected for de-0-methylcentrolobine  (Ic), and  the facile loss of a water molecule. This suggested the structural derivation of centrolobol by  hydrogenolytic  opening of the pyran-ring of the centrolobine system. Indeed, i.r. as well  as NMR evidence, obtained on centrolobol triacetate, pointed to the presence of one alcoholic  and two phenolic hydroxyls in centrolobol  itself. The aromatic region of this NMR  spectrum contained signals related to two symmetrical AA”BB” systems. The signals of  the aliphatic region were attributed to two benzylic and four unconjugated methylenes,  besides one carbinolic proton.  2H  Ox3-  \  Cl&-  -  (a)  4 -CH2-  l-CHOH-  (a  The structural moieties (IIa, b, c) which became evident through this analysis could be  linked in three different ways. The symmetrical alternative (IIIa) cannot represent the optic-  ally active centrolobol  ([algo  -WY).  A compound of structure IIIb should be easily dehyd-  rated. Formation of the styryl chromophore was, however, not observed when a benzene  solution of centrolobol was heated under reflux with p-toluenesulfonic acid.  s F. E. KINO, T. I. KING, D. H.

Indeed, only a 3-heptanol should be derivable  through the.hydrogenolysis  of the benzyl ether linkage of a centrolobine.  Hydrogenation of  (-)-centrolobine  (Ia) in presence of a Pd/C catalyst was carried out, and afforded the expected  (-)-O-methylcentrolobol  (IVa). Conversion of this derivative to (-)-di-O-methylcentrolobol  (IVb), equally accessible from (-)-centrolobol  (IVc = 111~) itself, was achieved by diazometh-  ane methylation.  OH  (IVa) Ra = Me, R2 = H  (IVb) R, = R2 = Me  (IVc) R1 = R2 = H  The asymmetry of centrolobol is caused by the substituents of the secondary carbinol:  two flexible chains which differ by two methylenes. Its absolute configuration could, conse-  quently, be derived by comparison with analogous compounds, the correlation of whose  molecular rotation and absolute configuration had been established by Brewster.’ According  to this treatment, an alcohol of absolute configuration (V), in which M - n = 2, should have  the molecular rotation of -24 which characterizes (-)-centrolobo1.  The definition of the  compound as 3%1,7-di-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-heptan-3-01  (Newman formulation VI) followed.  H-&+3,),-R  6H  (v)  The absolute configuration of (-)-centrolobine  (Ia) could now be deduced. The spatial  arrangement of the substituents at C-6 cannot suffer alteration during hydrogenolysis to (-)-  O-methylcentrolobol  (IVa), and thus it clearly also occurs in the S-configuration.  Marini-  Bettblo et al. already stated that the two a-hydrogens of the pyran ring of (+)-centrolobine  (Ia) are probably in the axial conformation. The arguments presented in favour of this deduc-  tion were the appearance of the corresponding NMR signals at relatively low field,’ and the  synthesis of (&centrolobine.  For reasons of stability, it was assumed that the acid catalysed  ’ J. H. BREWSTER.  1. Am. Chem. Sot. 81.5481 (1959).  1872  A.

The signal due to the proton at C-6 is not  sufficiently resolved at 60 MI-Ix to allow the direct determination of these constants. A dra-  matic improvement of this situation is apparent upon inspection of the 220 MHz spectrum  (Fig. 1). The multiplets due to the protons at C-2 and C-6 clearly show that these protons  have an axial conformation.  This is particularly evident in the pair of doublets which  represent H-2 (T J-70, Ju-  = 105 Hz, J,,,,  = 2-O Hz) and may be inferred from the pattern  width of 25 Hz for the signal due to H-6 (7 6.56). This width is in accord with the summation  of one axial-axial coupling, one axial-equatorial  coupling and two vicinal couplings to the  H  H  (CH3,--Rz  +  3  Rl  OH  H  (VI)  (-)-Centrolobol, G = H  H  H  (VII4  (-)Centrolobine,  G = Me  (VlIb) (-)-De&I-methylc., G = H  H  M~d3  H  3  HO  +  RI  H  (VIII) (+)-C!entrolobol, G = I&  H  H  H  H  2  6  R2  *  0  Rl  H  (IXa) (+)-Centrolobine, G = Me  0)  (+)_De-@methylc., G = H  RI  --&X2)2  -0  OH  -  R2  =  G  non-equivalent methylene protons of the freely rotating side-chain. Detailed analysis of the  splitting pattern shown by the H-6 signal gave J,,  = 10.5 Hz, J..+,, = 2-O I-Ix, Jvrc = 5.0  and = 7.5 Hz (Fig. 1).  These configurational and conformational facts are portrayed in the Newman formulation  (VIIa) which establishes  (-)-centrolobine  as 2R-(p-methoxyphenyl)-6S-@-(p-hydroxy-  phenyl)-ethyl]-tetrahydropyran.  The alternative presence of (+) and (-)centrolobine  in what is apparently the same  species merits attention.

Diarylheptanoids of Centrolobium  species  1873  or of the specimen which we used to give (-)-centrolobine.  The questions, whether different  stereoisomers are produced by different varieties, different geographical forms, or even if  one of the two specimens was incorrectly classified as C. robusturn, must, at present, be  considered unsolved.  However this may be, the configurational identity of C-6 in (-)-centrolobine  (VIIa) and  (-)-de-O-methylcentrolobine  (VIIb) and of C-3 in (- jcentrolobol  (VI) extracted from our  specimen of C. robusturn suggested the biosynthetic interconnexion of these compounds.  It  was anticipated on these grounds that in specimens which produce (+)-centrolobine as the  most abundant metabolite, dextrorotatory  companion substances should occur.

The ethanol extract of its  heartwood  yielded (+)-centrolobine,  (+)-de-O-methylcentrolobine  and (+)-centrolobol.  The NMR data for (+)-centrolobine were identical in all details, including the coupling con-  stants of the two doublets which represent the proton at C-2 and the pattern width of the C-6  proton signal, with the analogous data for (-)-centrolobine.  The structure of ZS-(p-methoxy-  phenyl)-6R-[@(phydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-tetrahydropyran  (IXa) was consequently assigned  to (+)-centrolobine,  while 3R-1,7di-(phydroxyphenyl)-heptan-3-01  (VIII) was considered  to represent (+)centrolobol.  The centrolobines and di-(phydroxycinnamoyl)-methane,  constituent of Curcumu longa  L. (family Zingiberaceae), ‘* have identical carbon skeletons and aromatic oxygenation  patterns.

This hypothesis was  extrapolated to the biosynthesis of centrolobine. 3 Alternatively, chain extension of 1 cinna-  mate unit by 5 acetate units could also represent a possible route to the natural diaryl-  heptanoids.

Isolation of (-)-Centrofobine,  Piceatannof, (-)-Centrolobol  uad  (-)-De-0-methyfcentrofobine  The powdered heartwood  (25 kg) was extracted at room temp. successively with benzene, acetone and  EtOH.  Evaporation  of the benzene solution gave a residue (80 g) which was chromatographed  on SiO,  (SOOg) giving a sole crystalline fraction (A,) upon elution with benzene. Evaporation of the acetone solution  gave a residue (20 g) which was chromatographed  on SiOl (200 g) giving a sole solid fraction (B,) upon elution  with benzene-acetone,  8:2. Evaporation  of the EtOH solution gave a residue (20 g) which was chromato-  graphed on SiOa (200 g) giving various fractions with the indicated solvents: benzene and benzeneCHClx,  9: 1 (C,), benzene-CHC&,  1: 1 and CHCll (C,), CHCl,-MeOH,  99: 1 (C,), CHCl,-MeGH,  95: 5 (C,), CHClr-  MeOH, 85: 15 (C,).  A, (6.5 g) was recrystallized from light petroleum-benzene  yielding (-)-centrolobine  (1.5 g). B, (@6g)  in MeOH solution was passed through a column of Sephadex LH-20 swelled in the same solvent. The first  fractions consisted of a brown resin and were discarded.  The crystalline fractions were recrystallized from  benzene-acetone yieldingpicea~ol(lO0  mg). C, (0.2 g) was recrystallized successively from light petroleum-  benzene yielding (-)centrolobine  (160 mg). C1 (0.1 g) was recrystallized from benzene-CHCll  yielding (-)-de-  O-methylcentrolobine  (30 me;). C3 (0.2 g) was a brown mass from which nothing useful could be isolated.  C, (@5 g) in MeOH solution was purified by filtration through a column of Sephadex-LH-20  swelled in the  same solvent. The first fractions were discarded.  The crystalline fractions were recrystallixed from benzene-  acetone yielding (-)-centrolobol(200  mg). Cg (@2 g) was treated in the same way as C,.
