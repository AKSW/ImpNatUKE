Abstract-Sitosterol  and the following  terpenic compounds  have been isolated  from the bark of Podocarpus  lam-  hrrtius: 3a-hydroxytotarol,  4h-carboxynortotarol.  and macrophyllic  and lambertic  acids. The leaves yielded sit-  osterol, stigmastan-3/?,5r-dial-6-one.  isopimaric  acid, phyllocladene,  isophyllocladene,  8,9-abieten-15-01  and 17-  isophyllocladenol  INTRODUCTION  Podocarpus lamhertius, commonly known as pin-  heiro bravo [I], is one of two Brazilian species of  the genus Podocarpus and a tree widely distributed  throughout southern Brazil. In continuation  of our  chemical studies of podocarps [2] an investigation  of the terpenic constituents  of P. lambertius bark  and leaves was undertaken.  RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION  Three bark constituents were identified as sitos-  terol, 4/?-carboxynortotarol  (1) [3-S] and macro-  phyllic acid (2) [7,9, lo], while the remaining sub-  stances CZoH,,O,  and CZ0HZ803 required  full  structural analysis.

The  PMR spectrum of the diol in CDCl, showed two  aromatic  one-proton  doublets at 6.50 and 6.96  ppm with J-values of 9 Hz each, which moved to  7.05 and 7.15 ppm in deuteriopyridine,  indicating  two vicinal aromatic hydrogens one of which was  ortho to a phenolic hydroxy group [l 11. The pre-  sence of an isopropyl group on the benzene ring  Cl.3 1 ppm (d, 3, J 7 Hz, Me), 1.33 (d, 3, J 7 Hz, Me),  3.28 (m, 1, CH)] and its vicinality to the hydroxy  function was indicated  by the deuteriopyridine  shift  ( 1.67-Me,  1.71-Me,  3.5hCH).  These  observations  indicated a totarol  skeleton or its  biogenetically  less likely 11 -isopropyl- 12-hydroxy  isomer. The PMR spectrum exhibited also a one-  proton doublet of doublets at 3.28 ppm (J 10, 7  Hz), indicative of a set-hydroxy  group adjacent to  a quaternary  carbon center. The high-field pos-  ition of the oxymethine  indicated  its equatorial  nature [ 12,131. The strong deuteriopyridine  shift  exerted not only on the oxymethine  (3.284  3.50  ppm) but also on two methyl singlets (0.87-+ 1.14,  1.05+ 1.32 ppm) and only a minor shift (A6 011  ppm) on the remaining methyl singlet suggested a  3b-hydroxytotarol  (3) relationship.  The diol 3  had been reported  as a product  of borohydride  reduction [ 141 of the naturally occurring 3-totaro-  lone [ 151 and its MS was recorded [ 141. Compari-  son of the highly characteristic fragmentation  pat-  243  tern and the other physical  properties  of an  auth-  entic specimen  [16] with those of the C2,)H3~,02  product  showed the compound  to be 3/Ghqdroxq.-  totarol  (3).

The  latter  revealed  an oxymethylene  singlet  at 4.17  ppm, which was shifted to 4.43 ppm in deuterio-  pyridine  [ 1 11, and an olefinic  hydrogen  singlet  at  5.63 ppm with a dcuteriopyridine  shift of 5.83 ppm  [l 11. These facts are accommodated  most readily  by a 2.3-dialkylallyl  alcohol  moiety. Three methyl  groups  appeared  at @74. 0.81 and 0.85 ppm and  were  unaffected  by deuteriopyridine.  Since  the  molecular  formula  suggested  a tetracyclic  con-  figuration,  the unusual  shielding  of one  of the  methyl  groups  (0.74 ppm) was reminiscent  of the  effect of the nuclear  double  bond  of hibaene  and  isophyllocladene  (9b) upon  their angular  methyl  groups.  Comparison  of the chemical  shifts of the  C(4) and C(10) methyl  groups  of the alcohol  with  the methyl  shifts of isophyllocladene  showed them  to be identical.  Hence the new alcohol  was 17-iso-  phyllocladenol  (12).  The C19H,,0,  product  revealed  TR absorption  bands  for hydroxyl  and acyclic  or six-membered  * The relationship  of the individual  functional  groups  to their  environment  was shown also by the products  of some simple  reactions  of the natural  substance.  While treatment  of the  latter with Ac,O  and C,H,N  gave a monoacetate.  acetyla-  tion under BF, catalysis  yielded a diacetate  (m.p. 169- 170 ),  Comparison  of the PMR spectra of the two acetates  showed  that the introduction  of the second  acctyl  group  had no  effect on any methyl groups but deshielded  the 3-oxymethine  by 0.23 ppm in conformity  with the presence of a 5%-hydroxy  group  oriented  I,3-diaxially  toward  the 3r-hydrogen.  Oii-  dation  of the natural  product  with chromic  acid in C,H,N  gave a hqdroxydione  (m.p. 25 I 253 ) whose lkile,  acid-in-  duced dehydration  with formation  of a conjugated  cnedione  cyclic, saturated  keto groups.  Its PMR  spectrum  revealed  six methyl  signals  whose chemical  shifts  and multiplicities  were indicative  of a stigmastane  skeleton.  One of the oxygens  reflected  a src-hyd-  roxy group  in view of a 3.95 ppm  oxymethine  PMR multiplet  which was shifted to 5.03 ppm on  acetylation  of the product.  The remaining  presence  of a hydroxy  absorption  band  in the IR spectrum  of the monoacetate  showed  the three oxygens  of  the natural  compound  to be part of a keto group,  of one sot-hydroxy  function  and of a tc>rt-hydroxy  unit. The ORD  spectrum  of the C79H5003  com-  pound exhibited  a negative  Cotton  effect at 323 nm  characteristic  of 4-, 6-, 7- and  16-ketocholestanes  [21].  Base-induced  deuteration  of the substance  showed the presence  of two hydrogens  r to the car-  bony1 group.  If it be assumed  that the compound  is an all-rr.rrns 3-hydroxysteroid,  the facts accumu-  lated thus far supported  a 3.5dihydroxy-6-keto  or  3.8-dihydroxy-7-keto  structure.  The  16-keto  sys-  tem was excluded  by the carbonyl  group not being  part of a five-membered  ring. while the 4-keto sys-  tem could be dismissed  by the persistence  of the 3-  oxymethine  PMR  signal  even  after  deuteration  and by the abnormally  high field position  and far  too complex  multiplicity  for an r-ketooxymethine  moiety. The two remaining  structures  could be dif-  ferentiated  by PMR in pyridine  [ 111. Comparison  of the PMR  spectra  of the natural  product  in  CDCl,  and pyridine  revealed  no solvent  effect on  the methyl  groups  but an extraordinary  shift on  the methine  associated  with the src-hydroxy  func-  tion. The oxymethine  multiplet,  whose shape (e.g.  W 1 2 = 16 Hz) was highly reminiscent  of 3/&hyd-  roxysteroids,  shifted 0.73 ppm downfield  in pyri-  dine solution.  This was in sharp contrast  to the A6  values of 0.25. 0.24. 0.26 and 0.16 ppm for 3fl-hyd-  roxy-5%. 3/j-hydroxy-.5P.  3x-hydroxy-5x  and  3~  hydroxy-5B  steroids,  respectively,  and reflected the  proximity  of the rc>rt-hydroxy group  to the 3cc-hy-  drogen  and the effect of both  hydroxy  functions  complexed  by pyridine  acting  on this hydrogen.  This structural  relationship  is satisfied  only by a  3[).5x-dihydroxy-6-keto  system.  In order to confirm  the functional  groups  of the  Cz9H,,,0,  product  and their positions  in the ster-  oid framework,  the spectral  properties  of the com-  pound and of its monoacetate  were compared  with  those  of  3/1.5x-dihydroxy-6-cholestanone  (13a)  [22] and  of its acetyl  derivative.*  The 6 and  J  values of H(3) and H(7) and of the 1%. 19, 21-. 26  and 27-methyl  groups  of the natural  product  and  its acetate  were nearly  identical  with those of the  corresponding  models. This observation  suggested  that the new plant  product  is 3P.S~-dih!drox~-(-  stigmastanonc  (1X). As a consequence.  a partial  systhesis  from /I’-sitosterol  was undertaken.  Trcat-  ment of the latter with formic acid and \vith hjdro-  gen peroxide.  followed  1~) hydrolysis  Lvith X~LICOLIS  base gave a trio1 whose oxidation  with N-bromo-  succinimide  [22] yielded  13b.

After cooling.  the resultant  paste was  treated  with 3 ml of 30”,, HzOz and shaken  at 20’  for 12 hr.  Boiling H,O  (40 ml) was added and the mixture  cooled and fil-  tered. The-ppt  was dried and dissolved  in 80 ml MeOH.  A soln  of NaOH  (3 ml of 20”,,) was added  and the mixture  boiled for  10 min. acidified with cone HCI. diluted with 30 ml of H,O  and  filtcrod. The ppt was dried at I20  for I2 hr. (While the crude  trio1 was used in the next reaction.  crystallization  of a small  sample  from hexanc  gave stigmastan-3/j.5z,6/&triol,  m.p. 242  244’  .) N-Bronlosuccinimide  (200 mg) was added to a soln of the  ppt in 10 ml of dioxane  and 2~5 ml of HZ0 at 25’  and the mix-  ture kept at this temp. for IO min. It then was cooled  in ice.  treated  with 5 ml of Hz0  and filtered.  The ppt (700 mg) was  washed with 50”,, MeOH  and crystallized  from MeOH  yielding  l3b: m.p.. m.m.p. 246 248 : identical  with the natural  product.
