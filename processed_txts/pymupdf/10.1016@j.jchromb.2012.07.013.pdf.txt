The  gingerols  puriﬁcation  was  carried  out in  HPLC  system  using  a Luna-C18 and  the best  mobile  phase  evaluated  was  MeOH/H2O (75:25, v/v). This  new  methodology  for  the gingerols  isolation  was  very  effective,  since  considerable  amounts  (in  the range  of  milligrams)  with  a good  purity  degree  (∼98%)  were  achieved  in  30  min of  chromatographic  run. [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-Gingerol  puriﬁed  by  this  methodology  inhibited  the proliferation  of  MDA-MB-231 tumor  cell  line  with  IC50 of 666.2  ± 134.6  �M,  135.6  ±  22.6  �M  and  12.1  ±  0.3  �M, respectively.  These substances  also  inhibited  human  ﬁbroblasts  (HF)  cell  proliferation,  however  in concentrations  starting from  500  �M.  In conclusion,  our  results  demonstrate  an  optimization  of  gingerols  isolation  and  their speciﬁc  anti-proliferative  activities  against  tumor  cells,  suggesting  their  use  as  important  models  for  drug design  in  an  attempt  to  develop  new  compounds  with  fewer  side  effects  when  compared  to conventional chemotherapy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction Several  population-based  studies  indicate  that  people  in  Asian countries  have  a  much  lower  risk  of  different  cancer  types  such as  colon,  gastrointestinal,  prostate  and  breast,  when  compared  to their  Western  counterparts.  It  is  widely  claimed  that  constituents  of their  diet  such  as  ginger,  garlic,  soy,  curcumin,  onion,  tomatoes,  cru- ciferous  vegetables,  chillies,  and  green  tea  contribute  to  that  lower incidence  [1].  Therefore,  there  is  increasing  interest  in  naturally occurring  cancer  chemopreventive  agents. Ginger  (Zingiber  ofﬁcinale  Roscoe)  is  widely  used  worldwide  as a  food,  spice  and  herb  [2].  Together  with  [6]-gingerol,  [8]-  and  [10]- gingerol  are  the  major  pungent  constituents  in  the  ginger  oleoresin ∗ Corresponding  author.

Gin- gerols  comprise  a  series  of  homologue  substances  differentiated by  the  length  of  their  alkyl  chains  with  [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol having  10,  12  and  14  carbons  in  their  unbranched  alkyl  chains, respectively  [3]. Regarding  [6]-gingerol  a  variety  of  pharmacological  charac- teristics  was  already  described,  including  analgesic,  antipyretic, cardiotonic,  hypothermia  inducing  and  cancer  preventing  effects [4–6].  However,  the  effects  on  tumor  cell  proliferation  for  [8]-  and [10]-gingerol  are  still  scarce. Breast  cancer  is  the  third  most  frequent  cancer  in  the  world  and one  of  the  most  common  malignant  diseases  in  women  worldwide. In  developing  countries,  it  is  the  second  highest  cause  of  death  in women  after  cervical  cancer  [7].  To  treat  breast  and  many  other cancer  types,  chemotherapy  is  one  of  the  most  extensively  studied methods.  However,  its  efﬁcacy  and  safety  remain  a  primary  con- cern  as  well  as  its  toxicity  and  other  side  effects  [8,9].  Another reason  for  concern  regarding  this  method  is  the  development  of chemotherapy  resistance,  which  is  a  major  obstacle  to  the  effec- tive  treatment  of  many  tumor  types,  including  breast  cancer  [8]. Tumor  cells  are  found  to  adopt  multiple  mechanisms  to  resist  drugs, such  as  decreased  uptake,  and/or  enhanced  efﬂux  and  altered  drug 1570-0232/$  –  see  front  matter ©    2012 Elsevier B.V.

Alteration  in  drug  targets,  activation  of  detoxiﬁcation systems,  enhanced  DNA  repair  ability,  and  inhibition  of  apoptosis are  also  cancer  cell  strategies  to  resist  against  chemotherapy  drugs [10]. Many  anticancer  therapies  can  temporarily  stop  tumor  growth; it  means  that,  in  most  cases,  the  effect  is  not  permanent.  In  this  way, there  is  a  signiﬁcant  need  for  new  agents  with  low  susceptibility  to common  drug  resistance  mechanisms  in  order  to  improve  response rates  and  potentially  prolong  patient’s  survival.  Approximately 30%  of  the  women  diagnosed  with  early-stage  disease  progress  to metastatic  breast  cancer.  To  these  women,  therapeutic  options  are still  limited.  Current  recommendations  for  ﬁrst-line  chemotherapy include  anthracycline-based  and  taxanes  treatments  (paclitaxel and  docetaxel)  [8].  Taxanes  –  which  are  taxol  derivatives  that  were ﬁrst  described  as  microtubule  stabilizing  agents  [11]  and  then  had their  antineoplasic  effects  conﬁrmed  [12,13]  – are  the  ﬁrst  example of  natural  product  derivatives  used  in  antitumor  therapy.  Therefore, the  search  for  new  natural  products  that  may  be  used  as  an  addi- tional  alternative  to  the  chemotherapy  in  an  attempt  to  develop more  effective  drugs  with  fewer  side  effects  is  of  great  interest  [14]. Based  on  this  assumption  it  is  important  to  develop  an  effective method  for  the  isolation  of  these  compounds. The  aim  of  this  work  was  to  search  a  faster,  efﬁcient  and  pro- ductive  procedure  for  isolation  of  [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol  by reverse  phase  HPLC  operating  under  overloading  conditions  and  to test  their  anti-proliferative  activity  on  MDA-MB-231  breast  cancer tumor  line  and  normal  human  ﬁbroblasts  (HF),  a  non  tumor  cell line.  The  results  presented  in  this  study  showed  a  more  speciﬁc anti-proliferative  activity  for  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol  against  breast cancer  compared  to  HF  and  suggest  their  use  as  important  models for  anti-cancer  therapy  in  an  attempt  to  develop  new  drugs  with fewer  side  effects  when  compared  to  conventional  chemotherapy. 2.  Materials  and  methods 2.1.  Chemicals [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-Gingerol  were  isolated  from  the  ethanol extract  of  the  ginger  rhizome  (purchased  locally)  by  liquid  chro- matography.  The  structures  were  elucidated  by 1H  NMR  using  a Bruker  DRX200  instrument  (Bruker,  USA),  operating  at  200  MHz  for 1H  spectra,  with  TMS  as  internal  standard,  GC–MS  on  a  Shimadzu QP  5000  and  comparison  with  literature  data.  The  purity  was  deter- mined  by  elemental  analysis  on  an  EA  1108,  CHNS-O  (Fisons).  HPLC grade  acetonitrile  and  methanol  were  purchased  from  JTBaker Company  (Netherland).  Water  was  deionised.  All  other  analytical grade  reagents  were  from  Sigma–Aldrich  (St.  Louis,  MO,  USA). 2.2.  [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-Gingerol  isolation The  fresh  ginger  rhizome  was  thin  sliced,  dried  at  40 ◦C  and ground  to  powder.  The  powder  was  extracted  with  ethanol  for  72  h, three  times.  The  solvent  was  evaporated  under  reduced  pressure  at 40 ◦C.  The  extraction  of  ginger  (0.4  kg  dry  weight)  yielded  21.2  g  of crude  extract  (5.3%).  The  extract  was  stored  at  −4 ◦C  for  the  later fractionation. In  order  to  isolate  [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol,  dry  ginger rhizome  crude  ethanol  extract  was  chromatographed  on  SiO2 (70–230  mesh)  column  with  bed  height  20  cm  (20  cm  ×  8  cm  i.d.), using  initially  n-hexane  (1  L),  to  eliminate  the  lipids.  After,  n- hexane/ethyl  acetate  50:50  (v/v,  2.5  L)  was  used  as  eluent  resulting in  5  fractions  (A1-5),  where  the  fractions  A1,  A2,  A3  and  A4 (68.9%,  14.6  g),  rich  in  [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerols,  were  joined resulting  in  the  fraction  A1–4.  Part  of  this  fraction  (5.5  g)  was re-chromatographed  on  SiO2 column  (28  cm  ×  5  cm  i.d.)  using n-hexane/ethyl  acetate  60:40  (v/v,  2.4  L).  Forty  eight  fractions (50  mL  each)  were  collected  and  combined  after  monitoring  by  TLC resulting  in  six  sub-fractions  with  the  following  volumes:  250  mL (B1),  400  mL  (B2),  150  mL  (B3),  800  mL  (B4),  200  mL  (B5)  and  600  mL (B6).  The  gingerols  were  the  main  constituent  on  the  fraction  B4 (800  mL,  2.8  g,  yellow  oil). Analytical  and  semi-preparative  HPLC  were  carried  out  using a  Shimadzu  SCL-10AVP  system  with  an  SPD-10AVP  UV–vis  detec- tor  with  a  ﬂow  cell  analytical  or  ﬂow  cell  preparative,  according with  the  HPLC  mode  (analytical  or  semi-preparative),  and  a  Shi- madzu  LC-6AD  pump.  The  isolation  optimization  was  carried  out on  a  Luna-C18 column  (250  mm ×  4.6  mm i.d.,  10  �m,  homemade, UFSCar,  São  Carlos,  SP,  Brazil)  and  the  column  was  maintained  at 25 ◦C,  the  detection  wavelength  was  set  at  282  nm  and  the  ﬂow rate  at  1.0  mL/min.  The  mobile  phases  consisted  of  isocratic  binary mixtures  (v/v)  of  MeOH/H2O  (80:20;  75:25;  70:30)  and  ACN/H2O (67:33).  Forty  microlitres  of  methanol  containing  0.156  mg,  5  mg, 7.5  mg,  15  mg  and  30  mg  of  B4  sample  were  injected.  In  the  col- umn  scale-up  reverse  phase  semi-preparative,  a  Luna-C18 column (300  mm × 10  mm i.d.,  10  �m,  homemade,  UFSCar,  São  Carlos,  SP, Brazil)  was  used.  This  column  was  maintained  at  25 ◦C,  the  detec- tion  wavelength  was  set  at  254  nm  (lower  absorbance  wavelength for  the  gingerols)  and  the  ﬂow  rate  at  6.0  mL/min.  The  best  mobile phase  was  MeOH/H2O  75:25  (v/v)  and  the  scale-up  factor  was calculated  using  Eq.  (1)  below,  where  S,  R,  L, P, A are  scale-up factor,  column  radius,  column  length,  semi-preparative  and  ana- lytical  columns,  respectively.  The  maximum  amount  of  fraction  B4 injected  in  the  semi-preparative  column  was  170.1  mg  diluted  to ﬁnal  volume  of  400  �L. S  = R2 PxLP R2 AxLA (1) 2.3.  Cell  line  and  culture MDA-MB-231  human  breast  tumor  and  HF  cell  lines,  obtained from  ATCC  (Manassas,  VA,  USA),  were  maintained  at  37 ◦C  in  5% CO2 in  Dulbecco’s  modiﬁed  Eagle’s  medium  (DMEM,  Cultilab  – Campinas;  SP,  Brazil)  containing  10%  of  FBS  (fetal  bovine  serum), penicillin  (100  UI/mL),  streptomycin  (100  mg/mL)  and  l-glutamine (2  mM).  Cell  cultures  and  experiments  were  conducted  in  a  humid- iﬁed  environment  with  5%  CO2 at  37 ◦C. 2.4.  Proliferation  assays Cell   lines   were   prepared   at   a   concentration   of 5  ×  104 cells/200  �L,  in  appropriate  medium  with  10%  of  FBS, and  plated  on  sterile  96-well  plates  for  5  h.  After  cell  adhesion  to the  plates,  the  DMEM  medium  was  replaced  by  DMEM  medium without  FBS  and  cells  were  maintained  for  14–18  h  at  37 ◦C  and 5%  CO2 in  a  cell  culture  incubator.  This  procedure,  known  as starvation,  was  used  to  synchronize  the  cell  cycle.  After  starvation, the  culture  medium  was  removed  from  the  wells  and  a  new  one, supplemented  with  10%  of  FBS,  containing  different  concentrations of  the  tested  compounds  was  added  to  the  wells.  The  cells  were incubated  for  24  and  48  h  under  the  same  conditions  as  described above.  Cell  proliferation  assay  was  performed  in  comparison  to the  wells  where  the  vehicle  compound  (2.5%  DMSO)  was  added instead  of  the  tested  compounds.  After  incubation,  the  culture medium  of  each  well  was  removed  and  a  solution  containing  MTT (0.5  mg/mL)  was  added  (100  �L/well).  The  plates  were  then  kept at  37 ◦C  for  4  h  and  the  formed  crystals  were  dissolved  in  isopropyl alcohol.  The  absorbance  was  read  on  an  ELISA  plate  reader  at  a wavelength  of  595  nm.  Doxorubicin  was  used  as  a  positive  control for  inhibition  of  cell  proliferation  [15]. J.A.d.

Chromatograms  of  fraction  enriched  in  [6]-gingerol  (peak  1),  [8]-gingerol (peak  2)  and  [10]-gingerol  (peak  3),  obtained  from  HPLC  in  analytical  scale.  The fraction  was  injected  in  a  C18 (250  mm ×  4.6  mm i.d.,  10  �m)  column  maintained at  25 ◦C  with  MeOH/H2O  80:20;  MeOH/H2O  75:25,  ACN/H2O  67:23  and  MeOH/H2O 70:30,  UV  detection  at  282  nm  and  ﬂow  rate  at  1.0  mL/min.  The  injection  volume was  40  �L. 2.5.  Statistical  analysis Each  experiment  was  repeated  three  times  in  triplicate  and  a standard  error  mean  was  calculated.  Shapiro–Wilk’s  W  test  was used  to  verify  data  normality.  As  normal  distribution  was  present, the  results  were  compared  statistically  with  a  two-way  analysis of  variance  (ANOVA).  Since  the  ANOVA  tests  showed  signiﬁcant differences  (acceptable  P  level  <  0.05),  Bonferroni’s  signiﬁcant  dif- ference  post  hoc  analyses  were  performed  to  determine  differences between  simple  and  grouped  main-effect  means,  respectively.  The data  were  analyzed  by  using  Statistica  software  (version  8.0;  Stat Soft  Inc.,  Tulsa,  USA)  and  IC50 calculations  were  made  using  Hill’s equation  in  the  Origin  software  (version  8.5;  OriginLab  Corporation, Northampton,  MA,  USA). 3.  Results 3.1.  [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-Gingerol  isolation Four  different  conditions  were  carried  out  on  analytical  C18 column  HPLC  to  achieve  the  best  separation  of  [6]-,  [8]-  and [10]-gingerol.  The  best  separation  condition  was  achieved  using MeOH/H2O  75:25  (v/v),  where  a  good  separation  of  three  gingerols in  a  single  run  of  30  min  was  obtained  (Fig.  1). The  injection  volume  (400  �L)  was  larger  than  the  usual  size  of an  injection  volume  and  also  it  was  not  the  one  that  was  calcu- lated  by  the  scale  up  formula.  This  occurred  because  of  the  sample viscosity,  which  would  be  very  high  if  170.1  mg  were  diluted  in 230  �L  (calculated  volume)  that  would  impair  the  chromatographic separation.  For  column  overloading  with  the  sample,  increasing amounts  of  fraction  B4  (0.156  mg,  5  mg,  7.5  mg,  15  mg  and  30  mg diluted  to  ﬁnal  volume  40  �L)  were  injected  in  a  C18 analytical column.  Using  the  detector  at  282  nm  electronic  saturation  was observed  when  5  mg  of  sample  was  injected,  although  the  peaks were  still  visible  for  isolation  of  gingerols  until  15  mg.  With  the injection  of  30  mg  of  sample,  the  electronic  saturation  hindered  the visualization  of  peaks  closer  to  peak  1  (Fig.  2).  To  solve  this  prob- lem,  on  the  semi-preparative  mode,  the  detector  was  set  at  254  nm and  in  this  condition  it  was  possible  to  identify  the  three  gingerols present  in  the  fraction. Fig.  2.  Overload  chromatograms  of  fraction  enriched  in  [6]-gingerol  (peak  1),  [8]- gingerol  (peak  2)  and  [10]-gingerol  (peak  3),  obtained  from  HPLC  in  analytical  scale. The  fraction  was  injected  in  a C18 (250  mm  ×  4.6  mm  i.d.,  10  �m)  column  maintained at  25 ◦C  with  MeOH/H2O  75:25,  UV  detection  at  282  nm  and  ﬂow  rate  at  1.0  mL/min. The  injected  masses  were  0.156  mg,  5  mg,  7.5  mg,  15  mg  and  30  mg.  The  injection volume  was  40  �L. Using  Eq.  (1)  for  the  determination  of  scale-up  factor,  the  value 5.67  was  obtained,  consequently  the  maximum  amount  of  B4  frac- tion  that  could  be  injected  in  a  semi-preparative  column  was 170.1  mg  (Fig.  3).  However,  to  make  the  adjustment  of  the  ﬂow  rate easier  we  decided  to  use  6.0  mL/min  instead  of  5.67  mL/min,  and  by working  in  this  condition  the  results  obtained  were  satisfactory. The  mass  of  each  gingerol  obtained  from  170.1  mg  of  fraction  B4 was:  94  mg  ([6]-gingerol),  22  mg  ([8]-gingerol)  and  17  mg  ([10]- gingerol).  The  purity  of  gingerols  was  calculated  based  on  the elemental  analysis  of  each  gingerol.  The  puriﬁcation  yields  based on  the  fresh  ginger  weight  were  1027,  241  and  187  ppm  for  [6]-, [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol,  respectively.  The  purity  obtained  was  94.4, 99  and  97.3%  for  [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol,  respectively. Fig.  3.

The  fraction  was  injected  in  a  C18 (300  mm ×  10  mm i.d.,  10  �m)  column  maintained at  25 ◦C  with  MeOH/H2O  75:25,  UV  detection  at  254  nm  and  ﬂow  rate  at  6.0  mL/min. The  injected  masses  were  85.1  mg,  170.1  mg.  The  injection  volume  was  400  �L. 160 J.A.d.  Silva  et  al.  /  J.  Chromatogr.  B  903 (2012) 157–  162 Fig.  4.

MDA-MB-231  tumor  cells  or  Human  Fibroblasts  were  plated  at  a density  of  5  ×  104 cells/200  �L  in  a  96-well  plate  containing  DMEM  medium  with  10%  of  FBS  (fetal  bovine  serum)  for  5  h.  After  cell  adhesion  to  the  plates,  the  DMEM  medium was  replaced  by  DMEM  medium  without  FBS  and  cells  were  maintained  for  14–18  h  at  37 ◦C and  5%  CO2 in  a  cell  culture  incubator.  This  procedure,  named  starvation,  was  used to  synchronize  the  cell  cycle.  After  starvation  the  monolayers  were  incubated  with  different  concentrations  of  [6]-,  [8]-  or  [10]-gingerol  in  DMEM  medium,  supplemented with  10%  of  FBS.  The  cells  were  incubated  for  24  (A)  or  48  (B)  hours.  Viable  cells  were  estimated  by  the  MTT  assay.

Effects  of  [8]  and  [10]-gingerol  on  normal  and  tumor  cell proliferation The  effects  of  isolated  compounds,  [6]-,  [8]-,  and  [10]-gingerol, were  compared  to  their  effects  on  HF,  a  normal  (non  tumor)  cell line  (Figs.  4A  and  B  and  5).  In  these  assays,  the  controls  were  made by  incubating  the  cells  in  a  normal  medium,  supplemented  with 10%  of  FBS  (+FBS),  in  a  medium  without  FBS  (−FBS),  adding  DMSO (ﬁnal  concentration  of  2.5%)  to  the  medium  supplemented  with  10% of  FBS  (DMSO)  and  ﬁnally,  in  doxorubicin  (1.5  �M),  a  compound used  in  breast  cancer  chemotherapy,  as  a  positive  control  for  cell proliferation  inhibition  [15]. The  results  showed  that  [8]-gingerol  affects  MDA-MB-231  cell proliferation  after  24  h  of  incubation,  with  500  and  1000  �M inhibiting  approximately  75%  and  50%  of  tumor  cell  prolifera- tion,  respectively  (Fig.  4A  and  B).  After  48  h of  incubation  with [8]-gingerol  100  �M  there  was  approximately  60%  of  MDA-MB- 231  cell  proliferation  inhibition  (Fig.  4B).  At  the  same  incubation period  with  [8]-gingerol  500  and  1000  �M,  MDA-MB-231  inhibi- tion  remained  in  a  rate  of  75%  compared  to  control  cells  (+FBS). [8]-Gingerol  1,  10  and  50  �M  had  no  effects  on  MDA-MB-231  cell proliferation  (Fig.  4A  and  B). Fig.  5.  Differential  effects  of  [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol  100  �M  on  MDA-MB- 231  and  Human  Fibroblasts  cell  proliferation  after  48  h of  incubation.  Results  are mean  ±  SD  of  three  independent  assays  in  triplicate  (a  = MDA-MB-231  vs.  HF  P  <  0.01; b  = MDA-MB-231  vs.  HF  P  <  0.001). J.A.d.  Silva  et  al.  / J.  Chromatogr.  B  903 (2012) 157–  162 161 For  [10]-gingerol,  a  concentration  of  100  �M  was  signiﬁcantly effective  in  inhibiting  MDA-MB-231  cell  proliferation  at  24  h  of incubation  in  a  rate  of  75%,  compared  to  cells  seeded  on  normal medium  (+FBS).  The  same  pattern  was  observed  after  48  h  of  [10]- gingerol  incubation;  there  was  a  cell  proliferation  inhibition  of about  90%  (Fig.  4B). HF  were  used  in  order  to  compare  the  effects  of  both  [6]-,  [8]- and  [10]-gingerol  in  a  non  tumor  cell  line  (Figs.  4A  and  B  and  5). No  signiﬁcant  differences  in  MDA-MB-231  cell  proliferation  using 1,  10,  50  and  100  �M  for  [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol  in  24  or  48  h  of incubation  were  veriﬁed.  However,  500  and  1000  �M  concentra- tions  were  effective  in  this  inhibition,  but  in  an  approximate  rate of  only  50%  (Fig.  4A  and  B). The  differential  effects  of  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol  100  �M  after 48  h  of  incubation  with  HF  and  MDA-MB-231  tumor  cell  line  are demonstrated  in  Fig.  5.  These  compounds  were  more  effective  in inhibiting  tumor  cell  proliferation  (MDA-MB-231)  when  compared to  normal  cell  proliferation  (HF).  The  IC50 values  for  [6]-,  [8]-  and [10]-gingerol  on  MDA-MB-231  cell  proliferation  were  calculated. The  results  showed  that  these  compounds  inhibited  the  prolifera- tion  of  MDA-MB-231  tumor  cell  line  with  IC50 of  666.2  ±  134.6  �M; 135.6  ±  22.6  �M  and  12.1  ±  0.3  �M,  respectively.  These  substances also  inhibit  HF  cell  proliferation,  nevertheless,  we  were  not  able  to calculate  the  IC50 values  for  this  cell  line,  since  the  initial  concen- tration  that  had  an  effect  was  500  �M  for  [6]-,  [8]  and  [10]-gingerol. 4.  Discussion Studies  of  isolation  and  puriﬁcation  of  gingerols  are  scarce  in  the literature.  Considering  the  interesting  biological  activities  and  the potential  of  these  compounds  to  the  medical  area  it  is  imperative to  develop  new  methodologies  to  achieve  an  optimization  of  gin- gerol  separation  and  puriﬁcation.  The  isolation  of  gingerols  ([6]-, [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol)  described  in  this  work  was  achieved  satis- factorily,  once  it  was  possible  to  obtain  relatively  high  mass  and  a good  degree  of  gingerols  purity.  To  our  knowledge,  only  one  work about  isolation  of  gingerols  using  HPLC  system  was  published  [18]. In  this  work,  the  authors  isolated  the  major  gingerols  from  the  crude dichloromethane  extract  of  ginger  rhizome  by  normal  phase  HPLC. A  low  purity  degree  (calculated  by  the  percentage  of  peak  area) for  both,  [8]-gingerol  (86%)  and  [10]-gingerol  (84%)  was  achieved, while  for  the  [6]-gingerol  the  purity  was  99%.  The  purity  degree obtained  for  each  gingerol  does  not  represent  the  real  one,  because HPLC  system  using  UV  detection  does  not  guarantee  the  absence  of other  components  in  the  sample.  In  a  recent  work,  the  isolation  of [6]-,  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol  was  carried  out  using  counter-current chromatography  (CCC).  In  this  study  gingerols  were  obtained  with high  purity  degree  (99%),  however  the  time  of  chromatographic run  was  very  length  (240  min)  [19].  In  another  work  regarding  iso- lation  of  gingerols  from  crude  extract  of  ginger  rhizome  using  CCC the  time  of  chromatographic  run  was  again  very  extensive,  and  the purity  was  about  98%  [20]. Electronic  saturation  is  a  factor  that  considerable  limits  the increasing  of  injected  mass  in  the  semi-preparative  scale.  In  our work,  this  factor  had  limited  injections  of  samples  with  higher masses,  even  at  a  wavelength  of  low  absorption  of  gingerols (254  nm)  (Fig.  3).  However,  the  gingerols  were  isolated  in  sig- niﬁcant  quantities  and  with  a  good  purity  degree.  To  avoid  the electronic  saturation  we  could  use  either  a  less  sensitive  ﬂow  cell  or make  the  adjustment  of  the  wavelength  well  off  the  lambda  max. We have  not  tried  a  less  sensitive  cell,  however  all  the  experiment conditions  were  tested  in  the  lower  absorption  wavelength  for  the gingerols,  and  we  still  obtained  electronic  saturation.  It  may  be possible  to  use  other  detectors  even  though  we  have  only  used  UV. The  effects  of  [6]-gingerol  on  tumor  cell  proliferation  are  already well  documented  [5,21–23],  however,  the  effects  of  [8]-  and  [10]- gingerol  on  tumor  cells  are  still  scarce.  In  fact,  among  all  the  ginger constituents,  much  more  attention  has  been  given  to  [6]-gingerol in  order  to  explore  its  pharmacological  properties  and  action  mech- anisms.  In  this  sense,  besides  [6]-gingerol  effects,  those  of  [8]-  and [10]-gingerol  on  in  vitro  tumor  cell  proliferation  using  MDA-MB- 231  and  HF  cell  lines  were  also  investigated. The  overall  results  suggest  that  the  higher  the  alkyl  chain,  the greater  the  effectiveness  of  gingerol  in  inhibiting  tumor  cell  pro- liferation,  probably  due  to  the  manner  in  which  these  substances enter  the  cells  through  their  plasma  membrane.  In  general,  with increasing  alkyl  chain  lengths,  there  is  an  increase  in  lipophilic character  (log  P)  of  compounds,  and  this  can  be  quantiﬁed  by  the partition  coefﬁcient  (P)  in  an  n-octanol/water  system.  It  is  also known  that  the  higher  the  log  P  value,  to  a  certain  extent,  the  higher will  be  the  permeation  in  biological  membranes  [24,25].  This  can be  extended  to  compounds  such  as  gingerols,  which  represent  a homologous  series  of  substances. Similar  effects  of  gingerols  and  other  ginger-derived  substances were  already  described  in  the  literature.  Tjendraputra  et  al.  [26] demonstrated  that  the  inhibition  of  COX-2  by  ginger  constituents and  synthetic  analogs  was  structure-dependent.  The  lipophilicity and  the  functional  group  substitution  on  the  alkyl  side  chain,  as  well as  the  aromatic  moiety  were  the  main  aspects  inﬂuencing  COX-2 inhibition.  Similar  correlations  between  the  side-chain  length  of gingerols  and  their  activities  of  apoptosis  induction  and  neuronal cells  protection  from  �-amyloid  insult  have  already  been  demon- strated  [27,28]. The  cytotoxic  effect  of  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol  has  been  investi- gated  by  a  few  authors  [27,29]. Kim  and  coworkers  [29]  have  tested the  effects  of  [8]  and  [10]-gingerol  in  a  variety  of  human  tumor  cells lines  including  A-549  (lung  cancer),  SK-OV-3  (ovarian  cancer),  SK- MEL-2  (skin  cancer)  and  HCT15  (colon  cancer).  They  found  an  IC50 ranging  from  approximately  4.52  �g/mL  (13  �M)  to  12.57  �g/mL (40  �M),  with  [10]-gingerol  being  more  effective  than  [8]-gingerol in  decreasing  the  viability  of  these  tumor  cell  lines  [29].  Wei  and coworkers  [27]  found  an  IC50 of  87.9  ±  3.5  �M  and  56.5  ±  6.0  �M for  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol,  respectively,  in  the  inhibition  of  HL-60 proliferation,  a  human  leukemia  tumor  cell  line.  These  data  are  in accordance  with  the  ﬁndings  in  this  work  on  MDA-MB-231  cells, revealing  the  same  activity  dependence  on  the  chain  length  size pattern. Kuo  and  collaborators  [30]  working  with  SW480  cells,  a  lin- eage  of  colorectal  cancer,  observed  that  [10]-gingerol  caused  a signiﬁcant  concentration-dependent  and  sustained  [Ca2+]i rise, suggesting  that  this  elevation  can  alter  cellular  functions,  leading to  cell  death.  They  found  a  cytotoxic  effect  of  [10]-gingerol  50,  75 and  100  �M  [30]. It  is  important  to  notice  that  the  methodology  in the  present  study  was  different,  even  though,  similar  effects  were found  in  MDA-MB-231  tumor  cell  line. Our  ﬁndings  demonstrate  a  speciﬁcity  of  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol on  the  inhibition  of  breast  tumor  cell  proliferation  when  com- pared  to  non  tumor  human  ﬁbroblast  cell  line.  The  ﬁndings  of  other authors  corroborate  with  our  results.  Kazi  et  al.  [31]  described the  effects  of  antibiotics  derived  from  �-lactam,  lactam  1  and  12 on  normal  and  tumor  cells.  They  show  that  lactam  1  selectively induces  apoptosis  in  human  leukemic  Jurkat  T,  but  not  in  the non  transformed,  immortalized  human  natural  killer  cells.  Further- more,  the  authors  demonstrated  that  lactam  12  induces  apoptosis selectively  in  Jurkat  T  and  simian  virus  40-transformed,  but  not in  non  transformed  NK  and  parental  normal  ﬁbroblast  cells.  The authors  propose  that  these  N-thiolated  �-lactams  act  by  inducing DNA  damage  that  leads  to  apoptosis  preferentially  in  cancer  and transformed  over  normal/non  transformed  cells.  Another  exam- ple  includes  pancratistatin,  a  natural  compound  isolated  from  the 162 J.A.d.  Silva  et  al.  /  J.  Chromatogr.  B  903 (2012) 157–  162 spider  lily,  which  is  an  efﬁcient  inducer  of  apoptosis  in  human lymphoma  (Jurkat)  cells,  with  minimal  effect  on  normal  nucleated blood  cells.  The  authors  discuss  that  this  selective  effect  could  be due  to  the  expression  of  the  Fas  receptors,  which  are  found  to  be greater  in  blood  lymphoma  cells  than  normal  blood  cells.  Further- more,  in  fast-dividing  cancer  cells,  the  plasma  membrane  tends  to run  short  of  lipids,  perhaps  changing  the  ﬂuidity  of  the  membrane [32].  Ovadje  et  al.  [33]  demonstrate  that  dandelion  root  extract  is capable  of  inducing  apoptosis  at  low  concentrations  speciﬁcally  in cancer  cells  with  no  toxicity  to  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells (PBMCs).  Finally,  Mathen  et  al.  [34]  working  with  extracts  from Calotropis  gigantea, the  giant  milkweed,  traditionally  used  for  the treatment  of  cancer  and  in  Ayurvedic  medicine  and  Poecilocerus  pic- tus,  an  orthopteran  insect,  which  feeds  on  C.  gigantea,  demonstrated that  both  the  insect  and  the  plant  extracts  induce  concentration- dependent  apoptosis  and  differentiate  between  human  cancer  cells and  normal  cells  and  exhibit  species  speciﬁcity. The   chemopreventive   mechanisms   of   gingerols   are   not well  understood  however,  are  thought  to  involve  proapoptotic [27,35–37], antioxidant  [38], anti-inﬂammatory  [6,39–41],  and anti-angiogenic  [42]  activities.  Further  investigation  will  be  done in  order  to  determine  the  mechanisms  by  which  [8]-  and  [10]- gingerol  act  inhibiting  with  more  speciﬁcity  the  MDA-MB-231  cell proliferation. 5.  Conclusion In  conclusion,  this  work  presents  a  new  methodology  for  the isolation  of  gingerols,  which  proved  to  be  effective,  once  consid- erable  amounts  with  a  good  purity  degree  in  a  relatively  short time  of  chromatographic  run  were  achieved  from  these  important bioactive  compounds,  mainly  [8]-gingerol  (99%)  and  [10]-gingerol (97.3%).  This  is  the  ﬁrst  report  on  the  separation  of  these  com- pounds  with  such  a  purity  degree  using  HPLC  semi-preparative scale.  Optimizations  in  the  separation  process  regarding  column overloading  can  still  be  made  so  that  the  electron  saturation  be  not reached,  which  can  be  achieved  by  using  other  less  sensitive  detec- tors.  The  gingerols  isolated  through  this  methodology,  demonstrate an  anti-proliferative  activity  of  [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol  speciﬁcally on  MDA-MB-231  breast  cancer  cells  when  compared  to  HF  normal cells.  As  far  as  we  know,  this  is  the  ﬁrst  report  regarding  a  speciﬁc cell  effect  of  ginger  derivatives.  The  results  also  suggest  the  use  of [8]-  and  [10]-gingerol  as  important  models  for  anti-cancer  therapy and  drug  design  in  an  attempt  to  develop  new  compounds  with fewer  side  effects  when  compared  to  conventional  chemotherapy.
