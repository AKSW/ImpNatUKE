Abstract-Six  reduced  p-hydroxyacetophenones,  a p-hydroxyvinylbenzene  derivative,  a chromanone,  and  acetylsarracinic  acid were isolated from the xylopodium of Calea cuneijdia. The constitutions  were elucidated by  spectroscopic methods and a few chemical transformations.  INTRODUCTION  In continuation  of the phytochemical investigations of the  genus  Calea (Compositae)  [l ] we now report  the  isolation  and  characterization  of sitosterol,  acetyl-  sarracinic  acid, 6-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylchroman-4-one,  Zsenecionyl-4-(1-hydroxyethyl)-phenol  and  five new  derivatives of this last substance from the hexane extract  of Calea cuneifolia DC. This appears to be the first report  of acetylsarracinic  as a free acid in plants.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The spectral data (UV, IR, ‘ H NMR and MS) of the  aromatic constituents  (l-4)  of the hexane extract of C.  cuneifolia show very similar features. All, except 4, present  IR absorption  characteristics  of an o-hydroxyaceto-  phenone (v,,, 164ocm-i).  The ‘ H NMR spectra show  the trisubstituted  pattern for these substances (Table 1).  The major compound  (la) has ‘ H NMR, IR, MS and  [cz]~ data  similar \; to  those  of 2-senecionyl-4-(1-  hydroxyethyl)-phenol\  isolated  before from Ageratina  altisima [2]. The obtention of acetophenone  [3], diacetyl  and dihydro derivatives confirmed the constitution.  Compounds lb and lc have the same molecular formula  (C,,H,,O,),  established by high resolution MS, UV and  IR spectra but different mps, RJ on TLC and [c1],,. These  observations  and the slight differences in the chemical  shifts of the bands in the ‘ H NMR spectra of these two  substances could only be explained by the assumption that  they are epimers. The absence of the hydroxyl bands in the  ‘ H NMR (present in la), the fragmentation shown in the  *Part II in the series “The Chemistry  of Brasihan  Compositae”. For Part I see ref. [l 1. Based on the M.S. Thesis  presented by Tania 0. Lourenqo to Universidade de Sao Paulo.

MS and the obtention of only a phenol acetate agree with  the constitution proposed for lb and lc. Compound lb has  [aI? - 11.6, C-7 and C-7’  having therefore the same  absolute configuration.  lc, with [a]i4 0, is the meso  compound.  In the ‘ H NMR spectra of Id and le this signal of H-7 is  shifted downfield relative to that in la. These substances  are the corresponding acetate and acetylsarracinate  of la.  Compound 2 presents in the ‘ H NMR spectrum a singlet  at 1.29ppm equivalent to 6H and a singlet at 3.07ppm  (2H) instead of the two methyl bands at 2.02 and 2.20 ppm  and the 6.70 ppm multiplet (1H) of la. These differences fit  very well with its formulation as the hydration product of  la.  The structure of the vinyl compound  3 was easily  established by ‘ H NMR data.  Compound 4 does not present the spectral absorptions  characteristic of the senecionyl and hydroxyethyl moieties  present in the spectra of the other compounds. The  chroman  structure  was suggested by the ‘ H NMR  spectrum. This compound has been described before as a  synthetic product [4].  The IR spectrum of 5 show absorptions characteristic  of ester and acid functions. The strong similarity between  the ‘ H NMR spectrum of this compound and that of the  acid moiety  of compound  le  indicated  that  it is  acetylsarracinic  acid. The other spectral data confirmed  this suggestion. As far as we know, this is the first report of  the occurrence of free acetylsarracinic  acid.  The dimeric compounds  (la and lc) and the vinyl  compound  (3) could be artifacts. This possibility  is  suggested by the presence of an acidic compound (5) in the  hexane extract of the xylopodium of Calea cuneifolia and  by the small amounts of these compounds in addition to  large amounts  of la. The absence of optical activity  strongly supports this probability in the case of lc.  Isoprenylated acetophenones are common in species of  the Compositae. Reduced acetophenones, however, have  been found previously only in species of the tribes Inuleae,  Heliantheae and Eupatorieae.  773  la  Table I. ‘H NMR of aromatic  constituents  of C. cuncijoliu (CCI,, 60 MHz. 6, J in Hz)  -~  Ib  lc  ld  ie  2  3  4*  H-3  H-5  7,6O  7.46  7,40  7,67  I,75  7,68  7,60  2.69  (d, J = 2, t I-I)  (~1,  J = 2, 2 H)  (d, J = 2, 2 Hj  (d, .J = 2, 1 H)  (d, J = 2, 1 H )  (d, f = 2, I H)  (d, f = 2, I H)  (s, 2 H)  7,30  7,40  7.32  I,41  7,43  7,39  7;su  7,40  (dd, J = X and 2.
