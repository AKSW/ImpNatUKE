(Rubiaceae) have been examined.1-5 Previous phytochemical studies of C. turbinata established the presence of indole alkaloids with weak antic- holinesterase activity2 as well as several phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties.3,5 Herein, the isolation, structural elucidation, and conformational analysis of a new C6.C3 lignan skeleton type (1) are reported. We have previously described the isolation of the two known phenolic compounds 2 and 3.4,6 Herein, their antioxidant proper- ties along with those of compound 1 are reported and compared with those of the commercially available antioxidant BHT. Evaluation of the parameters related to the antioxidant activity was accomplished by measuring the free radical scavenging ability of the compounds toward DPPH.7 The liquid-liquid partitioning of the EtOH extract of air-dried leaves of C. turbinata, followed by a sequence of size exclusion chromatography oftheEtOAc-soluble fractiononSephadex LH-20 and further puriﬁcation using C18 HPLC, eluted with a CH3CN/ H2O (18:88 v/v) isocratic elution using a Phenomenex Luna column (25.0 mm � 21.20 mm � 5 μm) at a ﬂow rate of 10 mL min-1 and UV detection at 280 nm, aﬀorded compound 1. Compound 1was obtained as an amorphous, pale brownpowder, [R]D 25 -204 (c 0.01, MeOH), which was analyzed for C29H28O12 by a combination of HRESIMS and 13C NMR data. The molecular formula of 1 was determined from the [M - H2O]þ peak at m/z 550.6433 (calcd for C29H26O11 550.1475). The IR spectrum with absorption bands at 3403, 1705, 1657, and 1627 cm-1 suggested the presence of phenolic and carboxylic groups. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) displayed signals for nine aromatic hydrogens, which indicates the presence of three aromatic ring systemswithdiﬀerentsubstitutionpatterns.Thesignalsatδ7.31(d, J = 2.0 Hz), 7.33 (ddbr, J = 2.0; 2.0 Hz), and 7.23 (s) corresponded to the aromatic hydrogens of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted ring. Addition- ally, the signals at δ 6.78 (d, J = 2.0 Hz), 6.69 (d, J = 8.0 Hz), 6.61 (J = 8.0 Hz), 6.67 (dd, J = 8.0; 2.0 Hz), 6.55 (sbr), and 7.32 (d, br, J = 8.0 Hz) were attributed to six aromatic hydrogens from 1,3,4- trisubstituted rings. These 1H NMR data clearly conﬁrm the presence of three distinct aromatic moieties in 1. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed signals for 29 diﬀerent carbons: 11 quaternary (sp2), two of which are carbonyls (δ 176.5, C-9; 173.6, C-7a), one quaternary (sp3); nine sp2 methines; four sp3 methines, three of which are oxymethine; and four methylenes, one of which is a sp3 methines. The signals at δC 146.0, 146.5, 116.8, 115.7, 123.8, 146.7, 146.0, 115.2, 116.5, and 121.7 were ascribed to two 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic systems characteristic of a catechol moiety.8 The signals at δC Special Issue: Special Issue in Honor of Koji Nakanishi Received: October 16, 2010 ABSTRACT: A lignan with a new skeleton named chimarrhinin (1) was isolated from an extract of the leaves of Chimarrhis turbinata, a Rubiaceae plant species. 13C NMR spectrometric techniques including 1D and 2D experiments and HRESIMS provided unequivocal structural conﬁrmation of this new C6.C3 skeleton type. The relative conﬁguration of 1 was established by 2D 1H-H analysis and J couplings, while its conformation was evaluated through molecular modeling using the RM1 semiempirical method, with the aid of coupling constants obtained by NMR analysis. The antioxidant activity of the new derivative 1 and two known and previously isolated phenolic derivatives (2 and 3) was investigated. An IC50 value of 7.50 ( 0.5 μmol L-1 was obtained for the new derivative 1, while 2 and 3 showed IC50 values of 18.60 ( 0.4 and 18.50 ( 0.6 μmol, respectively. 488 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np1007476 |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 487–491 Journal of Natural Products NOTE 117.7, 151.3, 115.7, 151.3, and 117.7 evidenced the presence of one 1,3,5-substituted aromatic ring.9 The signals at δC 63.3, 70.2, 71.2, and 81.5 were assigned to a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran moiety. The signal at δC 91.7 revealed a peculiar downﬁeld shifted carbon, which, analyzed together with the signals at δC 28.5, 41.3, 43.2, and 173.6, allowed us to attribute one part of the structure of 1 as being a trisubstituted lactone moiety (Table 1). Detailed analysis of the 1H-1H COSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra demonstrated that 1 bears a diﬀerent skeleton, with two C6.C3 units similar to those found in lignoids. Correlations between H-7 (2H, δ 3.06, d, J = 13.0; 17.5 Hz), H-8 (δ 4.22, dd, J = 13.0; 9.0 Hz), H-90 (2H, δ 2.70 and 2.75, J = 8.5 Hz), and H-80 (δ 3.33, m) were observed by 1H-1H COSY. The hydrogen at δ 3.06 (H-7) has HMBC correlations with the aromatic carbon at δ 125.6 (C-1) and with a quaternary carbon at δ 176.5 (C-9), as well as a correlation with a methine carbon at δ 43.2 (C-8). Correlations of the methylene hydrogen resonating at δ 3.33 (H-80) with C-10 and C-90 and correlations of H2-90 with C-80 and C-70 are also evident. The hydrogen at δ 4.66 (H-2b) correlates with C-70 and C-3b. From these observations and the analysis of all 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1), it is evident that the two caﬀeic acid units and a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran system are connected to the δ-lactone moiety. These data suggest the presence of a δ-lactone moiety linked at C-10 (ring C) and at C-2b (ring B), Figure 2. The anisotropic unshielded signals of the quaternary carbon C-7 (δ 91.7) might be explained by its ligands: oxygen, the aromatic carbon C-10, and C-2b. The correlations between H-2b (δ 4.66, d, J = 8.5 Hz), H-3b (δ 3.68, dd, J = 2.5; 8.5 Hz), H2-4b (δ 3.57, ddd, J = 2.5; 6.0; 6.5 Hz and δ 3.41, dd, J = 6.5; 11.0 Hz), and H2-5b (δ 3.32, m) indicate that ring B consists of a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran system, biogenetically derived from a tetrose sugar unit (Figure 2). HMBC correlations from the aromatic hydrogens at δ 7.33 (H-2a) and 7.31 (H-6a) of the third 1,3,5-trisubstituted aromatic ring (A) with C-7a (δ 176.5) showed that the third aromatic system is the 3,5-dihydroxylbenzoic ester moiety at C-3 of the tetrose ring (B) (Figure 2). These observations and the presence of two caﬀeic acid moieties, which could be biogenetically deﬁned as a neolignan, determined a skeleton formed by unusual couplings C-7-C-90 and HOC-9-C80. The spectroscopic evidence and a literature survey of lignan types (neolignans and lignans) indicated that compound 1 has a new neolignan-type skeleton. The relative conﬁguration of the sterocenters at C-2b, C-3b, C4-b, C-70, and C-8 and the conformation of 1 were determined on the basis of coupling constants and conformational analysis by the semiempirical RM1 method in the gas phase. For C-2b and C-3b, the coupling constants of H-2b (δ 4.66 d, J = 8.5 Hz) and H-3b (δ 3.68 dd, J = 8.5, 2.5 Hz) indicate a vicinal H-2bax-H- 3bax position, which is in good agreement with the presence of the gallate moiety in the β-position at C-3b. For C-4b, the coupling constants of H-4b (δ 3.56 ddd, J = 6.5, 6.75, 2.5 Hz) also conﬁrm an R-hydroxy group at this position. The 1H NMR data recorded in methanol-d4 clearly show all the coupling constants of H-4b with Hax and Heq-5b (Table 1) and conﬁrmed the tetrose moiety as part of this molecule. The coupling constants of H-8 (δ 4.22 dddbr, J = 9.0, 13.0 Hz) suggest the R-positioned 8-R, which is in accordance with the relative conﬁguration of C-8. The relative conﬁguration is assigned as 2R*, 3R*, 4S*, 70S*, and 8R*. To conﬁrm the relative conﬁguration of C-2b, C-3b, C-4b, and C-8 and in order to establish the conformation of 1, this structure was submitted to conformational analysis by the semiempirical RM1 method in the gas phase. The obtained minimum energy conformations enable estimation of 3JHH coupling constants by means of the Haasnoot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation,10 which considers the electronegativity of the substit- uents and the geometry of the H-C-C-H dihedral angle. A comparison between the theoretical and experimental coupling constants permitted the characterization of the conformation of chimarrhinin, represented in Figure 3, with the respective theoretical coupling constants (Table 1), considering the most stable envelope conformation of the tetrahydrofuran ring and half-chair conformation of the tetrahydro-2-pyranone ring. Con- sistent with previous conformational analyses of natural products with diverse skeletons,1,11,12 the employed semiempirical calcu- lations agreed with experimental data more satisfactorily when compared with older Hamiltonians such as AM1 and PM3 and ab initio HF/6-31G** calculations. The radical scavenging eﬀects observed for compounds 1-3 assayed with DPPH are summarized in Table 2, the standard antioxidant BHT (IC50 62.50 ( 0.6 μmol L-1), and chlorogenic acid (IC50 20.0 ( 0.2 μmol L-1) used as reference. The results indicate that the free radical scavenging activity of these mole- cules is due to their hydrogen-donating ability, provided by the stabilization of the phenoxy radical after DPPH reduction. Stabilization is enhanced by the presence of catechol groups and, in the case of the phenylpropanoids (2, 3), the R,β- unsaturated carbonyl moiety, as evidenced by their IC50 values. Compound 1 gave the best results, with an IC50 value lower than that of the standard BHT, a well-known food antioxidant. This result may be related to the presence of two catechol groups in this molecule. ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotation measure- ments were conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter using a quartz cuvette (length 1 cm). IR spectra were measured on either a Perkin- Elmer 1600 or a Nicolet EMACT-40 FTIR spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 NMR spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1H and at 125 MHz for 13C. TMS was used as internal standard. Mass spectra were obtained at high resolution on a Micromass Q-TOF spectrometer. For chromatographic procedures, Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech) was employed. Preparative HPLC separations were performed on a Varian Prep LC 4000 System, and C18 Luna (Phenomenex) columns and precolumns were utilized. Figure 1.

Prod. 2011, 74, 487–491 Journal of Natural Products NOTE Peaks were detected using a Varian model 320-chromatointegrator connected to a UV detector. All solvents (Merck or Mallinckrodt) were analytical or HPLC grade. The theoretical study was carried out using the semiempirical RM1 method on MOPAC 7.0 software. Plant Material. Chimarrhis turbinata was collected in Reserva do Viro, Bel�em, PA, Brazil, in February 2000, and identified by Dr. Marina Thereza V. do A. Campos. A voucher specimen, Lopes-51, was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, S~ao Paulo. Extraction and Isolation. Dried and powdered leaves of C. turbinata (1.2 kg) were exhaustively extracted with EtOH at room temperature to afford 57.1 g of dry residue, which was dissolved in MeOH/H2O (8:2, v/v) and extracted with n-hexane. The aqueous alcoholic fraction was evaporated to roughly MeOH/H2O (6:4, v/v) and then extracted successively with CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. All fractions were screened with β-carotene and DPPH assays, aiming at selecting potential antioxidant compounds. The EtOAc layer was active in these assays, and this extract was selected for guided fractionation. The dried EtOAc extract (4.16 g) was dissolved in MeOH (5 mL) and submitted to gel filtration over Sephadex LH-20. A total of 25 fractions of 25 mL each were collected and pooled according to their TLC profiles (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O, 65:30:5). Fractions A-6,7 and A-8 to A-12 exhibited antioxidant activity and were further purified by HPLC. Fractions A-8 to A-12 yielded the compounds described elsewhere.3,4 Fraction A-6,7 (0.699 g) was puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration over Sephadex LH-20 CC (88.0 cm � 2.0 cm), which was eluted with MeOH, giving 36 Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR Spectral Data for 1 in Methanol-d4 a gHMQC position δC δH (J in Hz) J (Hz)b theor gHMBC COSY TOCSY 1 125.6 H-7 2 116.8 6.78 d (2.0) n.d.c H-5 3 146.7 H-2 4 146.0 H-5, H-6 5 115.7 6.69 d (8.0) n.d.

The fractions B-20-30 (0. 387 g) tested positively in the β-carotene and DPPH assays, and they were further combined and subjected to preparative HPLC separation using CH3CN/H2O isocratic elution (18:88) [Phenomenex C18 Luna col- umn 25.0 mm � 21.20 mm � 5 μm, at 10 mL.min-1, with UV detection at 280 nm], to aﬀord 10 subfractions. From those, C-3 (97.2 mg) was separated by preparative HPLC using the same column described above [isocratic elution; H2O/MeCN/HOAc (84.5:15:0.5), UV detection at 237 nm, 12.0 mL min-1 ﬂow rate], to give compound 1 (4.3 mg). Molecular Modeling. The semiempirical calculations were car- ried out using the RM1 Hamiltonian13 within the MOPAC 7.0 program.14 The MOLDEN program was employed as a graphic interface for construction and visualization of the structure of compound 1.15 Hessian matrix analyses were used to unequivocally characterize the obtained conformations as true potential energy surface minima. Additionally, the minimum energy achieved by RM1 was further refined through ab initio calculations, using the GAMESS program16 at the HF/ 6-31G** level. In order to obtain theoretical 3JHH coupling constants for the minimum energy conformation achieved by conformational analysis, the Haasnoot-Altona parametrization of the Karplus equation15 was applied to the H-C-C-H dihedral angle geometries. Bleaching Experiments Using β-Carotene. After being de- veloped and dried, TLC plates were sprayed with 0.02% β-carotene solutions (Aldrich) in CH2Cl2. Plates were placed under natural light until discoloration of the background. The remaining yellow spots indicated the presence of antioxidant substances.7 Determination of the Radical Scavenging Activity. The DPPH radical was used in MeOH (100 μmol L-1). The reagent (2.0 mL) was added to a 1.0 mL aliquot of the compounds previously dissolved in MeOH, to yield final concentrations of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 μmol L-1. Each mixture was shaken and kept at room temperature for 30 min, in the dark. Chlorogenic acid and BHT were employed as standards. A DPPH solution (2.0 mL) in MeOH (1.0 mL) served as a control. Absorbances of the resulting solutions were measured at 517 nm using a Milton Roy 20 D spectrophotometer, and the percent inhibition was determined by comparison with a MeOH-treated control group.
