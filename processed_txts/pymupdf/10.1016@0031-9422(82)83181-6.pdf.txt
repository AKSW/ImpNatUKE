INTRODUCTION  Virola  sebifera  is widely  distributed  over  South  America.  The species has been reported  (under the  synonym  V. uenezuelensis Warb.) to yield a fat that is  valued for treatment  of rheumatism  in Venezuela  [2].  Although  in Brazil this “ucuhuba”  fat is expressed  for industrial  purposes,  and the bark of the tree  serves in the preparation  of hallucinogenic  snuffs by  Amazonian  Indians  [2], such uses are seemingly  res-  tricted to northern  regions and V. sebifera remains  without conspicuous  use in SBo Paulo State.  The compositions  of the triacylglycerols  [3,4] and  of the psychotomimetic  drug [2,.5] are fairly well  known. Since the biological activity of the crude fat  can hardly be due to the lipids the chemical analysis  of the seed seemed in order. Indeed, the present work  shows this to be a rich source of novel compounds,  the polyketide  la, the oxo-otobains  2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, as  well as further metabolites  to be described  in a sub-  sequent report.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Compound  la,  CZ3H3003, was recognized  as a  diarylundecanone  by the ‘H NMR signals for two  symmetrical  aromatic  rings, a phenyl  group and a  26-dihydroxybenzoyl  group,  as well  as for  ten  methylene  units, two of which placed (Y to carbonyl  or aryl  moieties.  Acetylation  of  la  led to the  monoacetate  lb  which,  as the parent  compound,  showed an AlCl, UV shift and a 1620cm-’ IR band,  both indicative  of an ortho-hydroxycarbonyl  sub-  stituted aromatic  ring. In contradistinction,  no AlCl,  UV shift was observed  for the diacetate (lc) and, as  expected,  the  IR  carbonyl  band  appeared  at  *Part XVI in the series “The Chemistry of Brazilian  Myristicaceae”, For Part XV see ref. [l]. Taken from part of  the M.S. thesis presented  by L.M.X.L. to the Universidade  de SLo Paulo (1980).  17OOcm-‘. The mass spectra were compatible  with  the structures,  showing the base peaks at m/z 137  (dihydroxybenzoyl  ions) and peaks of moderate rela-  tive intensity  at m/t 91 (tropylium  ions). In the spec-  tra  of  lb  and  lc  peaks  at  m/z  179 (acetoxy-  hydroxybenzoyl  ion) and 221 (diacetoxybenzoyl  ion)  were also present.  The structure  of the diarylundecanoid  la from V.  sebifera belongs to a type previously  detected in the  fruits of Myristica malabarica  Lam. [6]. The most  significant  difference  between  la and the malabari-  cones (Id, le, If, lg) refers to the biosynthesis  which  seemingly involves the condensation  of cinnamic acid  with myristic acid in the former case and with lauric  acid in the latter case.  Compounds  2a, 2b, 3a and 3b were recognized  as  4-aryltetralin  neolignans  by joint consideration  of the  formulae,  respectively  GJ-I,~OH  K&CH&O,  C18H130H(02CH2)20, C,sH,~OH(OMe)2 O&Hz0  and  C,8H,4(OMe)Z 02CHz0, the ‘H NMR spectra of which  all contained a pair of methyl doublets (J = 7 Hz), and  the mass spectra, which all contained  prominent  [M -  MeCH=CHMe]”  peaks. The uncharacterized  oxygen  atom of the formulae  must belong  to a carbonyl  which in all four compounds  is part of a benzoyl unit  (YInax  KBr 1674 * 9 cm-‘), and thus can occupy only posi-  tion 1 of the tetralins. The vicinal aromatic position 8  must be unsubstituted,  as indicated  by ‘H NMR sig-  nals at relatively  low field: 6 7.65 + 0.05 (d, J = 8 Hz)  for 2a and 2b; S 7.51 kO.05 (s) for 3a and 3b (Table  1). While these data define the constitution  of the  bis-methylenedioxytetralins  of  series  2,  doubts  remain concerning  the relative position of the vicinal  methoxyls  and the methylenedioxy  units in the com-  pound of series 3.  Conclusive  proof  of the  carbon  skeleton  was  obtained  for 3a. Acid dehydration  of this compound  leads to the 4-aryl-1-naphthol,  similar in respect  to  UV, IR and ‘H NMR characteristics  to tetradehydro-  isogalactin  (4b).

The difference between compounds  2a and 2b is of  a stereochemical  nature  as shown  by  ‘H NMR  measurements.  Indeed,  the coupling  constant  of the  H-2, H-3 interaction  is much larger for 2a (12 Hz)  than for 2b (3 Hz) and a tram  diaxial relation charac-  terizes  this system  in the former  compound.  Both  methyl substituents  of 2a must hence be equatorial,  a  conformation  which can be equally assigned  to the  piperonyl  group in view of its differential  shielding  effect on the methylene  protons  (6 5.66 and 5.78,  doublets, J = 2 Hz) of the CHz02 substituent  on posi-  tions 5 and 6. Acid or alkaline  treatment  of 2a, a  reaction  which would be expected to epimerize  C-2,  generates  2b. In this compound,  the steric  strain  resulting from the 1,3-cis interaction  of the methyl at  C-2 and the hydroxyl at C-4 should cause a change of  conformation  whereby the carbonyl and the piperonyl  ,a RI  = R’=  R’  r  R4 = H ,  n=8  lb R’ = R’ = R4 = H, RZ = AC,  n=8  IC R = R’ = AC,  R3 = R4 = H,  n= 8  ,,, RI = R’ i R3 = R” i H, n = 6  ,e R’ z R’ z R3= H,  P’  OH, n=6  ,f R’ i R2 z H, R” = R4 i OH, n ~6  lg R’ = R2 = H R3-R4, CH_0  L 21 n=6  R’ R2  2aR=pMe,  R-R’=0  2b R = aMe,  RI-R’=  0  2c R = PM,,  R’ = H, R’ = OH  2d R = PMe,  R’ = Ii, R’ = OAc  2e R = /3Me  R’ = H R2 = H  T  I  >  Me0  3a  R = OH  3b  R=H  4a  R= OH  4b  R=H  5a  R = OH  5b  R=H  Neolignans from Virola sebijera  753  groups  move somewhat  from their location  in the  equatorial  plane.  Indeed,  the carbonyl  of 2b (v,,,,~  1683 cm-‘) shows less conjugation  with the aromatic  ring than the carbonyl  of 2a (v,,,  1670cm-‘);  and  although the differential  action on the methylene  pro-  tons of the CH202 group at positions 5 and 6 remains,  no shielding  effect is perceptible  (6 6.03 and 6.00,  doublets, .I = 2 Hz).  The tram,  trans-configuration  of the two methyl  and the aryl substituents,  which prevails in 2a, is also  observed  for 3a and 3b. Again JH_2.H_3 (12Hz for 3a  and 3b) is rather large, as is JH_3,H_, (8 Hz) in 3b; and  again the equatorial  piperonyl group causes shielding  effects, on H-5 and on Me-3 (S 6.29, 0.88 respectively  for 3a and 6.26, 0.97 respectively  for 3b).  While  4-aryltetralone  neolignans  have  not been  reported previously,  4-aryltetralin  neolignans  are well  known  [7]. According  to Crabbe and Klyne [8] the  sign of the Cotton effect of the benzenoid  chromo-  phore between  275 and 290nm  is indicative  of the  configuration  of the 4-aryl  substituent,  a positive  effect pointing  to an n-aryl  group and vice versa.  Based on this rule, Klyne et al. [9] assigned the (2S,  3R, 4s)  and  (2S, 3R, 4R)  stereochemistries  to  hydroxyotobain  (5a) and otobain (5b), constituents  of  Dialyanthera  otoba (Myristicaceae).  Defunctionalization  of 2a at C-l,  by sequential  LiAlH4 reduction  to 2c and hydrogenolysis,  gave  hydroxyotobain  (2e) identical,  with respect  to the  ORD curve, to the compound  from D. otoba. The CD  curve, however,  shows that the Cotton effect in the  280-290 nm  region  is negative  (Table  2) and  that  hence,  according  to CrabbC and Klyne’s  rule [8], the  /3-aryl  (4R)  configuration  must  be  assigned  to  hydroxyotobain  2e, not 5a). The wrong stereochemi-  cal assignments  for hydroxyotobain  and for otabain in  the published  report [9] is due to the fact that the  authors  deduced  the sign of the Cotton effect con-  sidering the spectral region above instead of below  280 nm.  Transformation  of 2a into 2e excluding  alterations  in chirality implies that 2a must possess the (2S, 3S,  4R)-configuration.  Its positive  Cotton  effect at the  absorption  of the carbonyl  chromophore  (333 nm)  contrasts  with  the negative  effects  at the  same  wavelength  of 2b, 3a and 3b which thus must possess  respectively  the (2R, 3S, 4R), (2R, 3R, 4s) and (2R,  3S, 4R) configurations.  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation of constituents. Ripening fruits of V. sebifera  Aubl. were collected by Hipolito F. Paulino Filho, UNESP,  Araraquara, from a specimen, identified by Dr. William A.  Rodrigues, INPA, Manaus, near SLo SebastiPo do Paraiso,  Minas Gerais State. The seeds had their epicarp removed,  were air dried (72hr) and ground to a mass (225g) which  was exhaustively  extracted  with C6H6 at room temp. The  solvent was evapd and the residue (60 g) partitioned between  petrol and MeOH-H,O  (9: 1). The former soln was evapd  yielding fats. The latter soln was evapd and the residue  dissolved in EtOAc. The soln was washed with H20, 10%  aq. NaHCOJ and 2% aq. HCI. The EtOAc soln was evapd  and the residue (22 g) submitted to dry CC (4OOg Si gel,  CHCI,-EtOAc,  97:3).  The  column  was  cut  into  33  portions.  Portions  l-9 were crystallized  from MeOH to  yield fats (3.5 g). The mother liquor was evapd and the  residue separated by prep. TLC (AlzOp, CHCI,) into la  (400 mg) and 3b (38 mg). Portions  10-14, 15-23 and 24-28  gave products which were purified by repeated prep. TLC  (Si gel) into 2b (114 mg), 2a (2.1 g), 3a (164 mg) respectively.
