The structures of these compounds were determined mainly based on spectral analysis. The only known spirorotenoid described in the literature is amor- phispironone, isolated from Amorpha fruticosa. Introduction The genus Tephrosia belongs to the family Faba- ceae, which is well-known to be a rich source of flavonoids, besides the rotenoids among their sec- ondary metabolites. Rotenoids, an interesting class of compounds showing mainly activity against in- sects, have also shown powerful ictiotoxic activity, fish poison. Rotenone was the first rotenoid iden- tified and had been used as insecticide before the advent of the organosynthetic insecticides (Jacob- son, 1971). Recently, properties as anticarcino- genic activities have also been attributed to rote- noids. Tephrosin and amorphispironone (1) isolated from Amorpha species have shown a potential use against tumours including skin cancer (Konoshima et al., 1993 and Li et al., 1993). We have been interested in the chemistry of T. candida and have described the isolation of ro- tenoids from this plant (Andrei et al., 1997 and Pereira et al.,1998). In continuation of the study of the roots of T. candida we now describe the isola- tion and identification of three spirorotenoids, which represent a new spiroclass system formed by the rings B and C, a different spiro system type of amorphispironone, the only known spirorote- noid (Li et al.,1991).

All spectra were run in CDCl3 and with TMS as internal standard. Optical rotations were measured with a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter. Mass spectra were obtained with a HP 5987A spectrom- eter. Plant material Roots of T. candida (Roxb.) DC were collected and identified in the Instituto Agronoˆmico do Par- ana´, PR, Brazil, January 1988. Voucher specimens are deposited at the Herba´rio of Instituto Agro- noˆmico, Londrina, PR, Brazil. Extraction and isolation of compounds The roots were dried in an open stove at 60 ∞C and powdered affording 2.7 kg. Exhaustive extrac- tion with ethyl acetate after hexane extraction, gave 36.5 g of crude extract (dry weight). A part of the ethyl acetate extract (8.0 g) was submitted to drop- let countercurrent chromatography (DCCC) using an ascending system obtained from the mixture of the following solvents hexane:CHCl3:CH3CN (10:3:7 v/v/v). A fraction (2275 mg) was submitted to column chromatography (70Ð230 mesh) eluted with hexane and ethyl acetate with increasing po- larity. Purification of the fractions with silica gel columns (230Ð400 mesh), preparative tlc on silica eluted with hexane:CH2Cl2:MeOH (50:49:1 v/v/v) and recycling preparative HPLC on silica gel using as eluent a mixture hexane:CH2Cl2:i-PrOH (80:10:1 v/v/v) afforded tephrospirolactone (2) Unauthenticated Download Date | 1/19/16 8:56 AM C.

Results and Discussion The infrared spectra showed absorption of car- bonyls at 1681, 1748 and 1675 cmÐ1, and 1716 cmÐ1 for 2 and 3 respectively. The absorption 1748 cmÐ1 was attributed to a carbonyl of an α,�-dihydro-δ- lactone ring and the one 1716 cmÐ1 to the α,�- dehydro-cyclopentanone, while absorptions close to 1680 cmÐ1, are usually observed for carbonyls of 6a, 12a-dihydrorotenoids The 1H NMR of the three compounds displayed an AB coupling system for two geminal hydro- gens, neighbouring the quaternary carbon of the Table I. 1H NMR data for spirocompounds (CDCl3, 400 MHz).

This system has never been observed before for any rotenoids. Other signals showed to be characteristic of hydrogens in the rings A, D and E, exhibiting differences of the chemical shifts, in comparison with deguelin (5) (Andrei et al. 1997) and rotenone (6) (Birch et al. 1985) as models. The chemical shifts observed for H-1 and H-4 in the ring A (Table I) exhibited ac- centuated differences indicating the presence of an electron withdrawing substituent at the aromatic system. The hydrogens in the D and E rings showed closer chemical shifts when compared with those of the above deguelin and rotenone. The pair of doublets attributed to H-6 in the spirocom- pounds showed similar chemical shifts with those of the homoisoflavanone scillascillin (7). The di- astereotopic protons of this compound (H-2) ap- pear as an AB system, displayed at δ 4.52 and 4.62 (J = 11.0 Hz) (Heller and Tamm, 1981). The 13C NMR chemical shifts were attributed to the carbons of compounds 1, 2 and 3, having rotenone (6) (Crombie et al., 1975) and deguelin (5) (Andrei et al.,1997) as models (Table II). The chemical shifts of C-6a and the additional carbonyl in C-12a of the new compounds have never been described for common rotenoid skeleta before. The data of Table II are in agreement with the proposed structures. When compared with the model compounds the main differences observed were: deshielding of C-3 and C-4a (∆δ ~ 8 ppm), suggesting the addi- Unauthenticated Download Date | 1/19/16 8:56 AM 420 C. C.

The HMBC spectrum of tephrospirolactone (2)(Table III) showed cross peaks between hy- drogens and carbons (2J and 3J) that confirmed the proposed structure. The main correlation was observed between C-6a and the diasterotopic hy- drogens at C-6. EI/MS also corroborated the structures pro- posed for the spirocompounds. The spectrum showed two possibilities of a retro Diels-Alder re- arrangement.

Mass spectrum of 3, also presented the base peak due to the only one retro Diels-Alder type fragmentation. Rotenoid biosynthesis is already well-known (Crombie, 1984 and Crombie and Whitting, 1998). These two last reviews show the main biosynthetic pathways. The biosynthetic pathway for amorphi- spironone 1, isolated from Amorpha fruticosa (Li et al., 1991; Terada et al.,1993) was discussed by Li (1991), and also mentioned by Crombie (1998). For the spiroketones 3 and 4, a similar first step mechanism with an epoxidation, like in amorphi- spironone, can be suggested. Therefore, the start- ing compound should be the 6a,12a-dehydrode- guelin. The epoxidation should occur between C-6a and C-12a. In a hydrate form at C-12 car- bonyl, a pinacol-pinacolone type rearrangement could lead to the spiro compounds, after intercon- version to the carbonylated form and oxidation of C-12a into a keto group. Subsequent oxidation by a Baeyer-Villiger reaction type at C-12 and expan- sion to a six membered lactone ring could explain the formation of the spirolactone 2.
