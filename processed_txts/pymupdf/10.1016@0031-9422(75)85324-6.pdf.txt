Heimia  salicijblia  H.B.K.,  common  name: sinicuiche, voucher No. 7302 (Lythraceae).  Source. Collected at Villa Las Fuentes, Nuevo  Leon, Mexico in November and December 1973.  Uses. For dysentery, chest ailments and the prep-  aration of a hallucinogenic tea [l]. Previous work.  From H. salicijblia and related species, 20 alka-  loids have been reported  [2-61. All of them are  cis or trans lactonic  biphenyl  or biphenylether  quinolizidine  derivatives. Their structure, stereo-  chemistry  and absolute  configuration  has been  established [7]. Phenylalanine  has been found to  be a biosynthetic  precursor  of one of the major  alkaloids  of H. salicifolia [S]. The taxonomic  status of the genus Heimia is not completely clear  [9] and it appears that the type of alkaloids it  J?+  I= \’  Me0  OH  OMe  (1)  contains may vary with the place and date of  recollection  [7].  Present work. From the ethanolic  extracts a  high yield of mannitol was obtained. TLC com-  parison  with  the  known  Heimia  alkaloids  (MeOH-Me&O  1: 1, chromogenic  agent, Dra-  gendorll) showed that the light petrol and EtOH  extracts, contained  sinicuichine, cryogenine  and  nesodine. The first two were isolated and com-  pared with authentic specimens by, mmp, (c() and  TLC. Two new alkaloids AX-1  and ALC-2 were  isolated in this work; on the basis of their typical  mass fragmentation  [5], NMR [7,10] and proper-  ties of their methyl ether derivatives, they were  shown to be stereomers of lythrine (1). They exhi-  bited Bohlmann  bands [l l] in the IR, so they  must be nuns-quinolizidine  derivatives.  EXPERIMENTAL  Dried and powderized aerial parts of H. salicifofolia (850 g)  were Soxhlet extracted, first with light petrol and then with  EtOH. From the light petrol extract (8.5 g) only sitosterol  (O-1 g) was isolated, mmp, CO-TLC, IR, NMR, (a). On con-  centration of the EtOH extract, a yellowish solid (16.3 g) was  collected, which on recrystallization afforded 12 g of l-manni-  tol, mp 165-166” mmp, (a)p - 16.6”, mmp, IR, NMR, hexa-  cetate, mmp, (r) NMR, IR.
