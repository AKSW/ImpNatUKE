Compound 1 (30 mg) was hydrolized at  85', for 6 h, in EtOH-KOH 5% solution and  worked up in the usual way to give bauerenol(20  mg, rnp 206-208') (4).  EXTRACTION AND ISoLATIoN.-The  dry,  powdered, plant material (trunk, 1.0 kg) was ex-  tracted with hexane to yield a yellow, gummy  solid (8.0 g). The crude extract (6.0 g) was  chromatographed on Si gel (120 g), and the  CHCI, eluate gave a solid that partly crystallized.

Recrystallization of the  ketone (12 mg) from CHCI, gave a product which  showed ir and mass spectra identical with those  described in the literature for bauerenone (4-6).  5.  6.  P.
