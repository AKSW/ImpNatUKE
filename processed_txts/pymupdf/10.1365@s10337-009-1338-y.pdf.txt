The chromatographic method was validated considering both internal and external standard quantiﬁcation methods and showed good performances in terms of selectivity, linearity, precision (repeatability and intermediate precision), limit of detection, limit of quantiﬁcation, accuracy and stability. Keywords Column liquid chromatography–diode array detection Fingerprint analysis Quaternary aporphine alkaloids Flavonoid glycosides Styrylpyrones Cryptocarya mandioccana Introduction Cryptocarya mandioccana Meisner, the Brazilian-nutmeg (noz-moscada-do-bra- sil), is a tree species up to 30 m high that is widely distributed predominantly along the coastal Atlantic rain forest of south- eastern Brazil. Its fruits are distinct due to its aroma and pungent ﬂavor, being car- minative, and with stomachic properties. Its bark, bitter and scented, is also con- sidered to be stomachic and helpful in ﬁghting colic and diarrhea. The tea made from its seeds is used against stomach- ache, and its crushed leaves, against aches and colic. Still, the fruits are widely con- sumed by primate populations (brown howler monkeys (Alouatta fusca), brown capuchins (Cebus apella), and woolly spider monkeys or ‘‘muriquis’’ (Brachy- teles arachnoides)), and cracids (Pipile jacutinga, and Penelope obscura) [1]. Phytochemical studies on C. mandi- occana have shown that this species is rich in alkaloids, ﬂavonoids and styrylpyrones and has received special attention due to its potential usage for pharmacological purposes [2]. The qualitative and quanti- tative intraspeciﬁc variability of ﬂavo- noids and styrylpyrones has been determined in its leaves [1, 3–5] and this was related to the occurrence of two chemotypes in a C. mandioccana popula- tion characterized by signiﬁcant diﬀer- ences in the contents of styrylpyrones. The Chemotype F was characterized by predominance of ﬂavonoids. The chem- otype FS was characterized by the pres- ence of ﬂavonoids and styrylpyrones, but with predominance of the last. Analytical methods are necessary to evaluate these metabolites (alkaloids, ﬂavonoids and styrylpyrones) in inter and intra speciﬁc variability studies, in enzymatic studies and for extract stan- dardization to direct the usage of herbal medicines. A chromatographic method to qualitative evaluation of ﬂavonoid glycosides and styrylpyrones was devel- oped for Nehme and co-workers [3]. However, under these conditions some peaks were not well resolved, such as, peaks attributed to quaternary aporphine alkaloids. In addition, the method was not validated at that moment in time. In this paper, a ﬁngerprint was devel- oped to simultaneously evaluate the main 2009, 70, 1455–1460 DOI: 10.1365/s10337-009-1338-y 0009-5893/09/11 � 2009 Vieweg+Teubner | GWV Fachverlage GmbH Full Short Communication Chromatographia 2009, 70, November (No. 9/10) 1455 secondary metabolites from leaves from C. mandioccana (quaternary aporphine alkaloids, ﬂavonoid glycosides and sty- rylpyrones) using LC–DAD. Three types of reversed phase columns were evaluated, and the proposed ﬁngerprint conditions were validated in terms of selectivity, lin- earity, precision (repeatability and inter- mediate precision), limitofdetection, limit of quantiﬁcation, accuracy and stability [6, 7], in order to produce a robust chro- matographic method. Experimental Reagents and Materials Leaves of C. mandioccana, chemotype FS, were collected in the Carlos Botelho State Park (Sa˜ o Miguel Arcanjo, Sa˜ o Paulo, Brazil). The specimen was iden- tiﬁed by Dr. Pedro L.R. Moraes. A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botaˆ nica de Sa˜ o Paulo (IBSP) with reference number CAVALHEIRO CB 353. The collected leaves were oven dried at 40 �C for 24 h, ﬁnely ground and stored at 25 �C until required for the experiments. The solvents used for extraction (hexane and methanol) were analytical grade (Synth, Diadema, Sa˜ o Paulo, Brazil), whilst those used in the LC analysis (acetonitrile and methanol) were of LC grade (J.T. Baker, Xalostoc, Mexico). To extract and prepare buﬀers, acetic acid and H3PO4 were purchased from Synth (Diadema, Sa˜ o Paulo, Brazil) and TEA (triethylamine) from Vetec (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Water was puriﬁed with a Milli Q plus system (Millipore, Sa˜ o Paulo, Brazil) immediately prior to use. The standards of alkaloids (menisperine and xanthoplanine), of ﬂavonoids (quercetin-3-O-galactopyranoside, quer- cetin-3-O-glucopyranoside, quercetin-3- O-xylopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-arabi- nopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-allopyrano- side and quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside) and of styrylpyrones (cryptomoscatone E3, cryptomoscatone D1, cryptomosc- atone F1, deacetylcryptocaryalactone and cryptomoscatone E1) were obtained from the extracts of the bark and the leaves of C. mandioccana [2]. The inter- nal standard, goniothalamin, was obtained from the extracts of leaves from C. moschata. All standards were identi- ﬁed by UV and NMR data. Apparatus The chromatographic system consisted of a Varian ProStar 240 Solvent Delivery Module coupled to a Varian ProStar 330 Diode Array Detector (DAD) and a Varian ProStar 410 Autosampler (Palo Alto, CA, USA). Instrumental control and data processing were accomplished using a Varian Star Chromatography Workstation 5.52. Chromatographic Method Development The optimization of the ﬁngerprint was performed in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, the experiments were conducted in or- der to optimize the TEA and H3PO4 concentrations in the buﬀer, using a central composite design (Fig. 1), and to compare the performance of three reversed-phase chromatographic col- umns (Phenomenex Luna LC8, LC18 and phenyl-hexyl—all of them with 250 9 4.6 mm, 5 lm). The elution was performed with TEA/H3PO4 buﬀer (A) and acetonitrile (B), in a gradient elu- tion mode (A:B 85:15–60:40 in 45 min) plus an isocratic step of A:B 60:40 for 15 min, at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL min-1, at room temperature (25 �C) and a sample injection volume of 20 lL. The chromatograms were monitored at 254 nm and the UV spectra were re- corded from 200 to 400 nm. In order to provide a comparison among the dif- ferent chromatographic conditions, the global chromatographic resolution (RsG) was calculated as expressed by the equation: RsG ¼ P Rs n where Rs is the resolution of each pair of peaks and n is the total number of analyzed peaks, and used as dependent variable. The experimental concentra- tions of TEA and H3PO4 were coded in order to assist the construction of the experimental design, to remove factorial units, and to adjust the variable axes to intermediate values and to deﬁne a new scale. These coded values enabled a simpliﬁed computational manipulation of the data and increased accuracy for all the estimated coeﬃcients. The quadratic Fig. 1.

In the second step, experiments were conducted in order to optimize the selectivity of the mobile phase consider- ing as variables the proportions of its constituents (buﬀer, methanol and ace- tonitrile) and the gradient time in an experimental design using the column and buﬀer concentration determined in the ﬁrst step. Standard Solution Preparation An initial stock solution of menisperine, quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside and deacetylcryptocaryalactone (400 lg mL-1) was prepared by dissolving 2.0 mg of each compound in 5.0 mL of methanol: acetic acid 10% 1:1 (v/v). Another stock solution of goniothalamin (400 lg mL-1), the internal standard, was prepared by dissolving 2.0 mg of analyte in 5.0 mL of methanol: acetic acid 10% 1:1 (v/v). Working standard solutions (10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 75, 150 and 300 lg mL-1) of menisperine, quercetin- 3-O-rhamnopyranoside and deacetyl- cryptocaryalactone were prepared by appropriate dilutions of the initial stock solution. To these solutions 75 lg mL-1 of goniothalamin were added by appro- priate dilution of the initial stock solu- tion. Sample Preparation Milled leaves (100 mg) were weighed into a centrifuge tube and extracted with 4.0 mL of hexane by sonication for 30 min, followed by the addition of 4.0 mL of methanol:acetic acid 10% 1:1 (v/v) and sonication for another 30 min. The resulting mixture was stirred and centrifuged at 1,200g for 10 min and an aliquot (1.5 mL) taken from the hydroalcoholic phase was ﬁl- tered through a 0.45 lm Millipore mem- brane and submitted to LC analysis [4]. Method Validation The strategy applied to the validation of the ﬁngerprint was based on the ap- proach proposed by ANVISA [9]. A validation protocol was established and accepted values were deﬁned for the following parameters: selectivity, linear- ity, precision (repeatability and inter- mediate precision), limit of detection, limit of quantiﬁcation, accuracy, and stability [6, 7]. Selectivity The peak purity of the menisperine, quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside and deacetylcryptocaryalactone was evalu- ated by comparison of the UV spectra obtained at three points of each peak, using the PolyView 2000 5.5 software (Varian, 2000, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Peaks were considered pure when their UV spectra similarity (230 to 400 nm) was greater than 95%. Linearity The linearity was determined by the correlation coeﬃcient of the analytical curves obtained to menisperine, querce- tin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside and deace- tylcryptocaryalactone. Analytical curves were constructed for internal and exter- nal standard methods using seven con- centration levels (15, 20, 30, 50, 75, 150 9 300 lg mL-1) to each compound, and were analyzed in triplicate.

LC chromatogram obtained from hydroalcoholic extract of leaves from C. mandioccana, using the optimized gradient conditions Full Short Communication Chromatographia 2009, 70, November (No. 9/10) 1457 Precision For the internal and external standard methods, the precision was estimated by the evaluation of repeatability and inter- mediate precision at the three concentra- tion levels (15, 50 and 300 lg mL-1) for each analysis. To determine the repeat- ability (intra-day precision), samples were analyzed in triplicate on the same day and to measure the intermediate precision (inter-day precision), samples were ana- lyzed in triplicate on three diﬀerent days. The precision was expressed as the rela- tive standard deviation (RSD) of the concentration of the menisperine, quer- cetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside and deace- tylcryptocaryalactone. Limits of Detection and Quantiﬁcation The limits of detection (LOD) and quantiﬁcation (LOQ) were estimated by the method based on the parameters of the analytical curve. Accuracy The accuracy was determined by the standard addition method. For the internal and external standard methods, the extracts of C. mandioccana were analyzed in triplicate with and without fortiﬁcation with menisperine, quercetin- 3-O-rhamnopyranoside, and deacetyl- cryptocaryalactone at three concentra- tion levels (15, 50 and 300 lg mL-1). The accuracy was expressed as a per- centage ratio between the experimental average concentrations and the real concentration. Stability For the internal and external standard methods, a sample stability test was performed at three concentration levels (15, 50 and 300 lg mL-1) at regular intervals of 0, 24 and 48 h. The solution was stored at 4 �C during this period. Results and Discussion Chromatographic Method Development The chromatographic method previously established by Nehme and co-workers [4] was optimized and validated in order to simultaneously evaluate quaternary aporphine alkaloids, ﬂavonoid glyco- sides and styrylpyrones in leaves from C. mandioccana. The optimization of the method was performed in two steps. Firstly, the quadratic response surfaces were plotted using global chromato- graphic resolution (RsG) in function of the TEA and H3PO4 concentrations to each chromatographic column. The glo- bal chromatographic resolution (RsG) was greatly inﬂuenced by the type of the chromatographic column utilized (Fig. 2). For LC18 column a sela point was obtained at the stationary point, which corresponds to 11.6 mM of TEA, 19.5 mM of H3PO4 and RsG of 0.63. A minimum point was obtained at the stationary point for the phenyl-hexyl column, that correspond to 6.5 mM of TEA, 13.9 mM of H3PO4 and RsG of 0.48. The best conditions for the analysis of the secondary metabolites from leaves of the C. mandioccana were obtained at the maximum stationary point, corre- sponding to 11.9 mM of TEA, 14.3 mM of H3PO4 and RsG of 0.94, with the LC8 column. The RsG experimental value obtained in these optimum conditions was found to be within 99% of the conﬁdence level. In the second step, the experiments were conducted in order to optimize the selectivity of the mobile phase considering the proportions of its constituents (buﬀer, methanol, acetoni- trile) as variables, in an experimental design using an LC8 column and the buﬀer concentration found in the ﬁrst step. A multistep gradient condition (Table 1) was selected to provide a ﬁn- gerprint analysis of secondary metabo- lites from C. mandioccana. Peaks were identiﬁed by comparison with the retention times and UV spectra of the compounds previously obtained by phytochemical studies of Cryptocarya species [2–5]. According to Fig. 2, peaks 1 to 13 were identiﬁed, respectively, as menisperine, xanthoplanine, quercetin- 3-O-galactopyranoside, quercetin-3-O- glucopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-xylopy- ranoside, quercetin-3-O-arabinopyrano- side, quercetin-3-O-allopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside, cryp- tomoscatone E3, cryptomoscatone D1, cryptomoscatone F1, deacetylcryptocar- yalactone and cryptomoscatone E1. These chromatographic conditions en- abled the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the main secondary metabo- lites from leaves of C. mandioccana, including alkaloids, ﬂavonoid glycosides and styrylpyrones. Method Validation The validation was done based on the speciﬁc parameters given by the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance of Brazil (ANVISA) [7]. Selectivity The peak purity of the menisperine, quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside and deacetylcryptocaryalactone in the ex- tract was conﬁrmed by the PolyView- 2000, a diode array spectral processing software. Selectivity was assessed by analyzing the UV spectrum of each compound in three diﬀerent regions of Table 1.

Linearity Internal standard method: Analytical curves were constructed with seven con- centrations levels ranging from 15 to 300 lg mL-1 to each compound, with 75 lg mL-1 of goniothalamin (IS). The equations were calculated by linear regression to menisperine (y = -0.02563 + 0.00394x, r2 = 0.9964, RSD � 3.0%), to quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyr- anoside (y = -0.01953 + 0.00714x, r2 = 0.9999, RSD � 1.7%) and to deacetyl- cryptocaryalactone (y = -0.01466 + 0.00624x, r2 = 0.9998, RSD � 1.3%). All correlation coeﬃcients were accord- ing to accepted values (r � 0.99). External standard method: Analytical curves were constructed with seven con- centrations levels ranging from 15 to 300 lg mL-1 to each compound. The equations were found by linear regres- sion to menisperine (y = -0.27 + 0.06081x, r2 = 0.9967, RSD � 4.0%), to quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside (y = -0.02356 + 0.1099x, r2 = 0.9999, RSD � 3.6%) and to deacetylcrypto- caryalactone (y = -0.03459 + 0.09607x, r2 = 0.9999, RSD � 4.4%). All correla- tion coeﬃcients were according to accepted values (r � 0.99). Precision Internal standard method: The RSD to repeatability did not exceed 1.58% at the three concentration levels. To inter- mediate precision, the RSD did not ex- ceed 3.74% when it was considered for two days (n=6), and 4.53% when it was considered for three days (n=9), again, for the three compounds at three con- centration levels. These precision values are in accordance with the accepted values by ANVISA (RSD � 5%) [6]. External standard method: The RSD to repeatability did not exceed 4.42%, but to intermediate precisions for three days (n=9) the RSD for menisperine and deacetylcryptocaryalactone were found to exceed 5%, which were in dis- cordance with the accepted values (RSD � 5%). However, when they were considered for only two days (n=6), the RSD did not exceed 3.98% for the three compounds at three concentration levels. Limits of Detection and Quantiﬁcation The LOD and LOQ obtained for me- nisperine were 14.4 and 48.0 lg mL-1; for quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside were 0.9 and 3.0 lg mL-1; and for deacetylcryptocaryalactone were 2.7 and 9.0 lg mL-1, respectively. Accuracy Accuracy for determination of menisp- erine, quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside and deacetylcryptocaryalactone using internal or external standard methods were in the range of 80–120% consider- ing the three concentration levels, except for quercetin-3-O-rhamnopyranoside at 15.0 lg mL-1 in the internal standard method (Table 2). Stability The sample stability tests performed at three concentration levels showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the concentration values of menisperine, quercetin-3-O- rhamnopyranoside and deacetylcrypto- caryalactone after 24 h of the sample preparation, mainly when the quantiﬁ- cation was made by internal standard method. However, some important alterations were observed at the concentration level of 300 lg mL-1 when the samples were analyzed by the external standard method 48 h after preparation. Conclusion A chromatographic method was devel- oped to simultaneously evaluate quater- nary aporphine alkaloids, ﬂavonoid glycosides and styrylpyrones, which are the main secondary metabolites of leaves from C. mandioccana, using HPLC– DAD. The chromatographic conditions proposed include a Phenomenex Luna� LC8 column and a multi step linear ternary gradient elution program. The validation procedure showed that the internal standard method should be preferred to quantitative analysis and that all parameter evaluated are in accordance with ANVISA [6]. Table 2.
