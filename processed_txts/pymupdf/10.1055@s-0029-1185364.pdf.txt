Introduction ! Chagasʼ disease (American trypanosomiasis) af- fects 16–18 million people, mostly from Central and South America, where 25% of the total popu- lation are at risk of infection [1]. The treatment of Chagasʼ disease is still a challenge, since the cur- rently available drugs, nifurtimox (Lampit®, dis- continued by Bayer), a nitrofuran derivative, and benznidazole (Rochagan®, Roche), a nitroimida- zole derivative, have shown limited efficacy, strong side effects, and low effectiveness [2]. The Peperomia genus belongs to the Piperaceae family and consists of approximately 1700 spe- cies [3]. In contrast to the extensive studies in- volving compounds isolated from Piper species [4,5], only a few species of Peperomia have been subjected to systematic phytochemical investiga- tion. Peperomia obtusifolia is a well-known orna- mental plant distributed from Mexico to South America. A previous phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of P. obtusifolia showed the presence of five phenolic compounds bearing methyl, prenyl and geranyl groups [6]. This study describes the isolation and in vitro evaluation of the trypanocidal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi (Y-strain) and unspecific cyto- toxicity of seven known compounds (l " Fig. 1) from the active fractions of the ethanol extracts of Peperomia obtusifolia leaves and stems. This is the first report of the isolation of compound 2, the chromane 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2,7-di- methyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2-(4′-methyl- 1′,3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbox- ylic acid, from Peperomia obtusifolia. Materials and Methods ! Plant material Leaves and stems of Peperomia obtusifolia A. Diet- er were collected in Poços de Caldas, MG, Brazil and identified by Dr. Inês Cordeiro (Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). The voucher speci- men (KATO 070) has been deposited at the Her- bário do Estado “Maria Eneyda P. Kaufmann Fidal- go” (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Abstract ! The trypanocidal activity of crude extracts and fractions from the leaves and stems of Peperomia obtusifolia (Piperaceae) was evaluated in vitro against the epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the most active extracts afforded seven known com- pounds, including three chromanes, two furofur- an lignans and two flavone C-diglycosides. The most active compounds were the chromanes pe- perobtusin A and 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2,7-di- methyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2-(4′-methyl- 1′,3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbox- ylic acid, with IC50 values of 3.1 µM (almost three times more active than the positive control benz- nidazole, IC50 10.4 µM) and 27.0 µM, respectively. Cytotoxicity assays using peritoneal murine mac- rophages indicated that the chromanes were not toxic at the level of the IC50 for trypanocidal activ- ity. This is the first report on the trypanocidal ac- tivity besides unspecific cytotoxicity of chro- manes from Peperomia species. Additionally it represents the first time isolation of 3,4-dihydro- 5-hydroxy-2,7-dimethyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-buten- yl)-2-(4′-methyl-1′,3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzo- pyran-6-carboxylic acid from P. obtusifolia.

Extraction and isolation The powdered air-dried leaves (600 g) and stems (64 g) were ex- tracted at room temperature with EtOH (4 × 2500 mL, 72 h each and 4 × 500 mL, 72 h each; respectively). The crude leaves extract (39.6 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of H2O/ MeOH (20:80 v/v) and partitioned using Hex (3 × 35 mL), Hex/ EtOAc (30:70 v/v) (3 × 35 mL) and EtOAc (3 × 35 mL), which af- forded EL‑H, EL‑HE, EL‑E and EL‑MH fractions, respectively. EL‑H (15.5 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (20–63 µm, 7 × 15 cm) eluted with a gradient of hexane-EtOAc and EtOAc-MeOH (3 L and 1.5 L, respectively), yielding 26 frac- tions (170 mL each, A-1 to A-26). Compound 1 (50 mg) was ob- tained from A-7 (320 mg) by recrystallization in MeOH (45°C). EL‑HE (2.2 g) was submitted to low-pressure column chromatog- raphy over a C18 column (4 × 18 cm), under gradient elution (5– 100% MeOH in H2O) (1.5 L) yielding 14 fractions (100 mL each, B-1 to B-14). B-7 (232.8 mg) after semipreparative reversed phase HPLC (C18, 10 µm, 250 mm × 21.2 mm, MeOH/H2O 65:35 v/v, flow-rate 16 mL/min, UV detection at 254 nm), yielded 2 (40 mg, Rt = 19.8 min). Compounds 3 (6 mg, Rt = 7.8 min) and 4 (7.2 mg, Rt = 12.4 min) were purified from B- 9 (160.0 mg) under the same conditions as for B-7. EL‑MH (10.8 g) was subjected to low-pressure column chroma- tography over a C18 column (5 × 28 cm), under gradient elution (5–100% MeOH in H2O) affording 14 fractions (C-1 to C-14). C-8 and C-9 (165 and 168 mg, respectively) were pooled and then subjected to semipreparative HPLC (phenyl-hexyl, 10 µm, 250 mm × 21.2 mm, MeOH/AcOH aqueous 0.5%, 22:78 v/v, flow rate 14 mL/min, UV detection at 254 nm) to yield 5 (23 mg, Rt = 20 min). The stems ethanol extract (5.7 g) was dissolved in 60 mL of H2O/ MeOH (20:80 v/v) and partitioned using hexane, EtOAc and n- BuOH (3 × 20 mL each) to give ES‑H, ES‑E and ES‑B fractions, re- spectively. ES‑H (2 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (20–63 µm, 3 × 12 cm) eluted with hexane-EtOAc and an EtOAc-MeOH gradient (300 mL and 150 mL, respectively), to afford 13 fractions (50 mL each, D-1 to D-13). D-5 (60 mg) was purified using preparative TLC with toluene/hexane (20:80 v/v) yielding 6 (5 mg, Rf = 0.7) and 7 (2 mg, Rf = 0.75). For compounds 1, 2, 5–7, the purity (> 99%) was determined by HPLC analysis us- ing a diode-array detector (monitoring at λ = 254 nm) and two different chromatographic conditions (C8 and C18 stationary phases). Melting points of compounds 3 and 4 were determined and were in accordance with literature values. Fig. 1 Structures of compounds isolated from Peperomia obtusifolia. 621 da Silva Mota J et al.

HPLC and specific rotation analysis Analytical and semipreparative HPLC separations were per- formed using stainless-steel Phenomenex Luna® columns (250 × 4.6 mm I.D., 5 µm C8 and C18; 250 × 21.2 mm I.D., 10 µm; C18 and Pheny-hexyl; Phenomenex). Methanol was obtained from J.T. Baker. HPLC separations were carried out using a Varian Prepstar SD-1 equipped with a Rheodyne (Cotati) injector with a 2 mL sample loop and a Varian ProStar 320 UV‑Vis detector. Spe- cific rotations of the isolated compounds dissolved in chloroform were measured on a Perkin Elmer 241 polarimeter equipped with a Na lamp operating at 589 nm. Trypanocidal assay [7] An in vitro assay was performed measuring the proliferation of Y- strain epimastigotes growing in axenic culture. The samples to be tested were stored as 1 mg/mL stock solutions in dimethyl sulfox- ide (DMSO) and were serially diluted in LIT medium before use. The crude extracts, fractions and pure compounds were tested at 0.4, 1.2, 3.7, 11.1, 33.3, 100 and 300 µg/mL, in triplicate, using 1 × 105 epimastigotes/well. The number of remaining viable pro- tozoa was established by counting in a Neubauer chamber fol- lowing incubation at 28°C for 72 h with the test samples. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values and statistical data were determined with the probit analysis method using GW-BA- SIC 2.33 (Microsoft Software, 1987). The positive control benzni- dazole (> 99% of purity by HPLC) was obtained from Rochagan® tablets (Roche Brazil). Cytotoxicity assay The unspecific cytotoxic activity was determined according to the method of Mosmann, with minimal modifications [8]. Briefly, Balb/c isogenic mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 3 mL of sodium thioglycolate 3%. The animals were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber 3 days after inoculation. The peritoneal macrophages were extracted by injecting phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) followed by slight massage and suction using a syringe. The cells were transferred to a sterile tube in an ice bath and cellular suspension was prepared after centrifugation. The sediment cells were resus- pended in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 µg/ mL of streptomycin, 100 U/mL of penicillin and 5 × 10−2 M of β mercaptoethanol at density of 5 × 106 cells/mL (stock suspen- sion). In a 96-wells microtiter tray, 100 µL of cells from the stock suspension and 100 µL of test solutions dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium (final concentrations: 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2.5 and 1 µg/ mL), were added. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C and 7.5% CO2, 100 µL of an MTT solution (2.5 mg/mL) were added to each well and incubated for 3 h under the same conditions. The optical density (590 nm) of the formazan crystals dissolved in 2-propa- nol was measured and compared with the negative control (only RPMI). The positive control for the trypanocidal assay (benznida- zole) was also evaluated. All treatments were performed in trip- licate and the IC50 values (with 95% confidence intervals), were determined by linear regression analysis of dose-response curves, using Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Software). Results and Discussion ! In this work, we assessed the anti-trypanosomal activity of crude extracts from the leaves and stems of Peperomia obtusifolia, and their fractions obtained by liquid-liquid partition against the epi- mastigote forms of the Trypanosoma cruzi Y-strain. The crude ethanol extract from the leaves of P. obtusifolia showed significant trypanocidal activity (IC50 of 4.3 µg/mL) when com- pared to the positive control benznidazole (IC50 of 2.7 µg/mL) (l " Table 1). Thus, this extract was fractionated and all fractions EL-H, EL-HE, EL-E and EL-MH (IC50 of 3.9, 0.2, 5.6 and 7.7 µg/mL, respectively) were also active, with EL‑HE being the most active with an IC50 of 0.2 µg/mL. The crude ethanol extract from the stems of P. obtusifolia showed lower activity than EL (IC50 of 23.2 µg/mL), nevertheless it was partitioned as well. All fractions were tested and the hexane (ES‑H) and ethyl acetate (ES‑E) frac- tions were the most active with IC50 values of 2.8 and 7.2 µg/mL, respectively. Chemical investigations of the active fractions led to seven (1 – 7, l " Fig. 1) known compounds: the chromanes 3,4-dihydro-5-hy- droxy-2,7-dimethyl-8-(2′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2-(4′-methyl-1′, 3′-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (1) [9], pe- perobtusin A (6) [6] and clusifoliol (7) [6], [10]; the furofuran lig- nans 2-episesalatin (3) [11] and sesartemin (4) [12]; and the flavone C-diglycosides isoswertisin-4′-methyl-ether-2′′α-L-rham- noside (2) and isoswertisin-2′′α-L-rhamnoside (5) [13,14]. The structures of 1 – 7 were confirmed by IR, MS, 1H-, 13C‑NMR and 2D NMR spectral data, which were in agreement with the re- ported data for the respective compounds. Compounds 1, 6 and 7 had an optical activity [α]D 25: 0° (c. 1.0, CHCl3) suggesting a racemic mixture in the molecules bearing a chiral center at C-2. These results are in accordance with the data Table 1 In vitro trypanocidal activity of extracts and fractions from Peperomia obtusifolia (Piperaceae) against epimastigote forms of Trypanosama cruzi Y- straina.

This is the first report of the isolation of compound 1 from P. obtusifolia. It had previously been re- ported from Peperomia amplexicaulis [9]. The trypanocidal activity of the isolated compounds was deter- mined using benznidazole as the positive control (IC50 of 10.4 µM, l " Table 2). The chromanes 1, 6 and 7 showed better try- panocidal activity, with IC50 values of 27.0, 3.1 and 47.5 µM re- spectively, than the lignans and glycosylflavones isolated. The po- tent trypanocidal activity observed for these compounds bearing a benzopyran nucleus substituted with isoprenyl moieties sup- ports our recent report which showed the trypanocidal activity of chromenes isolated from Piper gaudichaudianum and P. adun- cum and semisynthetic derivatives [7]. Even though the furofuran lignans 2-episesalatin (3) and sesarte- min (4) had been isolated from the most active fraction EL‑HE (IC50 of 0.2 µg/mL, l " Table 1) they showed weak activity, indicat- ing loss of the trypanocidal activity during fractionation. The fla- vone C-diglycosides 2 and 5 isolated from the leaves of P. obtusifo- lia did not display any trypanocidal activity (l " Table 2). As ob- served for the inactive lignans 3 and 4, the further chromato- graphic fractionation of the active EL‑MH fraction (IC50 of 7.7 µg/mL) resulted in the isolation of inactive compounds. De- spite the negative results obtained for the flavone C-diglycosides 2 and 5 as well as for lignans 3 and 4 in the trypanocidal assay, further studies of EL‑HE and EL‑MH could be promising for the search of new trypanocidal compounds. The most active compounds 1 and 6 were also evaluated for their unspecific cytotoxicity in mammalian cells (murine peritoneal macrophages), and the obtained values indicated that chromanes were not toxic at the level of their trypanocidal activity (IC50 of 405.0 and 402.1 µM, l " Table 2). Nevertheless, the cytotoxic activ- ity of 1 and 6 was higher than that of benznidazole (IC50 of 1138.0 µM, l " Table 2), which was included in order to establish a comparison with the only drug available for the treatment of Chagasʼ disease. As selectivity is a relevant characteristic for de- fining lead molecules, the cytotoxicities were compared to the antiparasitic activities by calculating the SI (selectivity index) [16]. The SI values for 1, 6 and benznidazole were 14.9, 130.4 and 109, respectively, suggesting that 1 and particularly 6 have good selectivity for T. cruzi epimastigotes when compared with benznidazole. In conclusion, the present investigation revealed that the bioas- say-guided fractionation of extracts from the leaves and stems of P. obtusifolia led to the isolation of prenylated benzopyrans with potent anti-trypanosomal activity and a good selectivity in- dex when assayed in mammalian cells. These findings suggest that Piperaceae species are an important source of new trypano- cidal compounds. More extensive and detailed studies on the try- panocidal activity of natural chromanes as well as chromane de- rivatives should be undertaken in order to provide an under- standing of structural requirements for biological activity.
