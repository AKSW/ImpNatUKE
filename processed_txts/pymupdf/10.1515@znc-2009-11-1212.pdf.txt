In this context, endo- phytes belonging to the Penicillium genus have  been recognized as a rich source of bioactive sec- ondary metabolites (Fill et al., 2007). Recent ex- amples include the anticancer berkelic acid from  Penicillium sp., polyketides with HIV-integrase  inhibitory activity from P. chrysogenum and the  insecticidal paraherquamides H and I from P. clu- niae (Singh, 2003; Stierle et al., 2006). As part of our interest for bioactive metabo- lites from endophytes associated with Brazilian  plants (Cafêu et al., 2005; Inácio et al., 2006; Silva  et al., 2006; Teles et al., 2006), Alibertia macrophyl- la (Rubiaceae) was selected for our study, due to  the fact that this species accumulates a series of  bioactive compounds (Bolzani et al., 1991; Silva  et al., 2007). Thus, the major aim of the current study was  to identify potential bioactive compounds from  Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, two endo- phytes associated with A. macrophylla leaves, by  using antifungal and acetylcholinesterase inhibi- tory assays. Material and Methods General 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz),  gHMBC, gHMQC and gCOSY experiments were  recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer,  using the solvents as internal standard. Mass  spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Micromass  spectrometer in the ESI mode using MeOH/H2O  (1:1) as solvent (cone voltage 25 V).

Naturforsch. 64 c, 824 – 830 (2009); received June 29, 2009 In the course of our continuous search for bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi  living in plants from the Brazilian ﬂ ora, leaves of Alibertia macrophylla (Rubiaceae) were  submitted to isolation of endophytes, and two species of Penicillium were isolated. The ac- etonitrile fraction obtained in corn from a culture of Penicillium sp.1 afforded orcinol (1).  On the other hand, Penicillium sp.1 cultivated in potato-dextrose-broth furnished two differ- ent compounds, cyclo-(L-Pro–L-Val) (2) and uracil (3). The chromatographic fractionation  of the acetonitrile fraction obtained from Penicillium sp.2 led to three dihydroisocoumarins,  4-hydroxymellein (4), 8-methoxymellein (5) and 5-hydroxymellein (6). Compounds 5 and 6  were obtained from the Penicillium genus for the ﬁ rst time. Additionally, metabolites 1 – 6  were evaluated for their antifungal and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities.  The most active compounds 1 and 4 exhibited detection limits of 5.00 and 10.0 μg against  Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, respectively. Compound 2 showed a  detection limit of 10.0 μg, displaying potent AChE inhibitory activity.

Spots on  TLC plates were visualized under UV light and  by spraying with anisaldehyde/H2SO4 reagent fol- lowed by heating at 120 ºC. Preparative HPLC  was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system  using a Phenomenex C-18 preparative column  (250 mm × 21.2 mm). Analytical HPLC was per- formed on a Varian Pro Star 230 instrument using  a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm).  Column chromatography (CC) was performed  over reversed-phase silica gel 230 – 400 mesh  (Merck). Plant material Authenticated Alibertia macrophylla K. Schum.  (Rubiaceae) was collected in Estação Ecológica  Experimental de Mogi-Guaçu, Fazenda Campin- inha, Mogi-Guaçu, São Paulo, Brazil, in Novem- ber 2003. The botanical identiﬁ cation was made  by Ph.D. Maria Cláudia Marx Young (Institute of  Botany, São Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher speci- men was deposited at the Herbarium of the Bo- tanic Garden of São Paulo, Brazil (voucher no.  SP 370915). Isolation and identiﬁ cation of the endophytes For isolation of the endophytic fungi, adult and  healthy leaves of A. macrophylla were selected  and submitted to surface sterilization. They were  ﬁ rst washed with water and soap, and then im- mersed in an 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite  solution for 5 min and 70% aqueous ethanol for  1 min. A second washing with water and soap was  performed and ﬁ nally the leaves were immersed  in sterile water for 10 min. Sterilized leaves were  cut into 2 × 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri  dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and  anthramicine sulfate (50 mg/mL) with approx. 3  to 4 pieces on each dish (Silva et al., 2006). The endophytic fungi were identiﬁ ed according  to the characteristics of morphology of the cul- ture and spores, mechanism of spore production,  and molecular taxonomy according to a modi- ﬁ cation of the rapid preparation of DNA from  ﬁ lamentous fungi (Raeder and Broda, 1985). The  fungi were identiﬁ ed by Ph.D. Derlene Attili  de Angelis (CPQBA-UNICAMP – Centro Plu- ridisciplinar de Pesquisas Químicas, Biológicas e  Agrícolas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in our  collection with culture numbers 05070032-C and  05-070032-A for Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium  sp.2, respectively. Preparation of the crude extract in corn and  potato-dextrose-broth of Penicillium sp.1 The cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9  Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) each containing as  medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The  media were autoclaved four times (four consecu- tive days) at 121 ºC for 40 min. After cool, the  media were inoculated with the endophyte and  incubated at 25 ºC in static mode for 21 d. After  the incubation period, the solid cultures were  ground and extracted with MeOH (6 × 250 mL);  after that the solvent was evaporated, providing  the crude MeOH extract (10.6 g). The methanol  extract was dissolved in water and then subjected  to liquid-liquid partition with EtOAc. The EtOAc  fraction was suspended in acetonitrile and parti- tioned with hexane. Evaporation of the organic  phase resulted in the crude acetonitrile extract  (804 mg). The fungus was cultivated using potato-dex- trose-broth (PDB) as culture medium (4.0 g of  potato extract, 20.0 g dextrose/L H2O). For the  PDB, 20 Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) were used,  each containing 100 mg of potato extract, 5.0 g  dextrose and 250 mL distilled water, which were  autoclaved at 125 °C for 15 min. Approx. 10 small  pieces (1 cm2) of PDA medium from the Petri dish  containing biomass of Penicillium sp.1 were inoc- ulated into each ﬂ ask, and the ﬂ asks were sealed  with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After in- cubation for 28 d at 25 °C on rotatory shakers at  150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the  ﬂ asks was separated from the aqueous medium  by ﬁ ltration, and the ﬁ ltrate was partitioned with  EtOAc (3 × 2.5 L). Collection and evaporation of  the organic phase under reduced pressure yielded  a brown, solid residue (507 mg). Preparation of the crude extract in corn of  Penicillium sp.2 The cultivation in corn was accomplished in 9  Erlenmeyer ﬂ asks (500 mL) each containing as  medium 90 g of corn and 75 mL of water. The  media were autoclaved four times (four consecu- tive days) at 121 ºC for 40 min. After cooling, the  media were inoculated with the endophyte and  incubated at 25 ºC in static mode for 21 d.

The  acetonitrile fraction was evaporated resulting in  the crude acetonitrile extract (6.0 g). Isolation and identiﬁ cation of compounds 1 – 6 The crude acetonitrile fraction obtained in corn  of Penicillium sp.1 (804 mg) was fractionated by  CC using silica gel C18 eluted with a H2O/ac- etonitrile gradient (10 – 100% acetonitrile) af- fording 10 fractions (A – J). Fraction D (13.1 mg)  afforded compound 1. The crude EtOAc extract  obtained in PDB of Penicillium sp.1 (507 mg) was  fractionated by CC using silica gel C18 eluted  with a H2O/acetonitrile gradient (10 – 100% ac- etonitrile) affording 5 fractions (K – O). Fraction  C (30.5 mg), after recrystallization with MeOH,  led to compound 2 (4.5 mg). Fraction L (40.2 mg)  was further puriﬁ ed using RP-HPLC [λ = 254 nm,  12.0 mL/min, H2O/acetonitrile (9:1, 40 min)] and  supplied compound 3 (12.4 mg, Rt = 3 min). The crude acetonitrile fraction obtained in corn  of Penicillium sp.2 (6.0 g) was fractionated by CC  using silica gel C18 eluted with a H2O/MeOH  gradient (5 – 100% MeOH) affording 16 fractions  (Fr1–Fr16).

TLC plates were eluted with an  appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol), in  order to wash them, and were thoroughly dried  just before use. After migration of the sample in  a suitable solvent (or direct deposition of sam- ple), the TLC plate was dried for complete re- moval of the solvent. The plate was then sprayed  with enzyme stock solution and thoroughly dried  again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate  was laid ﬂ at on plastic plugs in a plastic tank con- taining a little bit of water; by this means, water  did not come directly into contact with the plate  but the atmosphere was kept humid. The cover  was placed on the tank and incubation was per- formed at 37 °C for 20 min. For detection of the  AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1-naphthyl  acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast  Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL)  were prepared immediately before use. After in- cubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the 1-naph- thyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue  B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the  plate to give a purple colouration after 1 – 2 min.  Galanthamine was employed as positive control  (Marston et al., 2002). Results and Discussion The molecular structures of all isolates (Fig. 1)  were conﬁ rmed by the MS and NMR data as  shown below. Assignments were based on 2D- NMR experiments including gCOSY, gHMQC,  and gHMBC. Compound 1 was isolated as a brown amor- phous powder and its ESI mass data suggested the  molecular formula C7H8O2 ([M–H]– at m/z 123).  The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed two aromatic  signals, δH 5.99 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-6) and δH  6.01 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H, H-2 and H-4) suggesting  a trisubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and  DEPT 135o spectra showed ﬁ ve signals, assigned  to one oxygenated aromatic groups at δC 158.1  (C-1 and C-5), two methines attributed to signals  at δC 99.7 (C-6) and δC 106.9 (C-2 and C-4) and  one methyl group at δC 21.1 (C-7). The position  of the methyl substituent at position C-3 was at- tributed on the basis on the gHMBC experiment,  which indicates a correlation of δH 2.43 (H-7) with  δC 138.9 (C-3) and δC 106.9 (C-2 and C-4). This  data suggests that 1 is orcinol (Monde, 1998). Compound 2 was isolated as a white amor- phous solid and its ESI mass data indicated the  molecular formula C10H16N2O2 ([M+H]+ at m/z  197). The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed signals  at δH 0.86 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-11), δH 1.02 (d,  J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-12), δH 4.12 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H,  H-6), and δH 3.92 (brs, 1H, H-9). Also, three mul- tiplets at δH 3.40 (2H, H-3), 1.78 (2H, H-4), and  2.13 (2H, H-5) were observed. Analysis of the  13C NMR spectrum indicated two methyl groups,  three methylene carbon atoms and three methine  carbon atoms. The signals at δC 170.2 and δC 165.2  were attributed to two amide carbonyl groups at  C-7 and C-1, respectively, and 1H NMR signals  of an amino acid suggested that 2 belongs to the  diketopiperazine class. The gHMBC cross-peaks  between the signal for C-1 and the signals for H-3,  H-6, H-9, and H-10, as well as the signal for C-7  and the signals for H-5, H-6, and H-9 conﬁ rmed  that 2 was biosynthesized by condensation of the  amino acids proline and valine. The interpretation  of these results combined with comparison with  literature data (Furtado et al., 2005) suggest that  diketopiperazine 2 is cyclo-(L-Pro–L-Val). Compound 3 was isolated as yellow amorphous  solid and its ESI mass data suggested the molecu- lar formula C4H4N2O2 ([M–H]– at m/z 111). The  1H NMR spectrum of 3 appeared to be relatively  simple, exhibiting two doublets at δH 5.41 (d, J =  8.0 Hz, 1H, H-5) and δH 7.38 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H,  H-6). The 13C NMR spectrum showed only four  signals, for two carbonyl groups [δC 151.9 (C-2)  and δC 164.4 (C-4)] and two methines [δC 99.9 (C- 5) and δC 142.9 (C-6)]. These data indicate that 3  is uracil (Schindler, 1998; Martin et al., 2007). Fig. 1. Chemical structures of compounds 1 – 6 isolated  from Penicillium sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2.

M. Oliveira et al. · Bioactive Metabolites from Penicillium Endophytes Compound 4 was isolated as a white amorphous  solid and its ESI mass data indicated the molecu- lar formula C10H10O4 ([M+Na]+ at m/z 217). The  1H NMR spectrum showed doublets for three ar- omatic protons at δH 6.86 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-5),  δH 6.96 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, H-7) and δH 7.45 (dd,  J = 7.5, 8.5 Hz, 1H, H-6). Altogether these signals  suggest that 4 presented a trisubstituted aromatic  ring. The gCOSY cross-peaks of the doublet at δH  1.51 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 3H, H-9) coupled to a methine  hydrogen atom with a signal at δH 4.63 (dq, J =  6.5, 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-3) in turn coupled to a methine  hydrogen atom at δH 4.50 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, H-4),  suggesting an α-methylhydroxy unit in the molec- ular structure of 4. The broad singlet at δH 11.0  (1H) indicated the presence of an intramolecular  hydrogen bond between a hydroxy group (8-OH)  and a carbonyl group (C-1). The 13C NMR and  DEPT 135o spectra showed the presence of ten  signals, assigned to one methyl [δC 16.0 (C-9)], ﬁ ve  methine groups [δC 78.1 (C-3), δC 67.2 (C-4), δC  118.5 (C-5), δC 136.7 (C-6), δC 118.2 (C-7)], and  three aromatic quaternary carbon atoms [δC 162.1  (C-8), δC 106.8 (C-8a), δC 140.5 (C-4a)], and one  signal at δC 169.1 (C-1), which was attributed to  a carbonyl group, suggesting that 4 is an dihydro- isocoumarin. This information coupled to data of  the literature (Holler et al., 1999) assigne 4 to the  structure of 4-hydroxymellein. Compound 5 was isolated as a white amor- phous solid and its ESI mass data suggested the  molecular formula C11H12O3 ([M+H]+ at m/z 193).  In particular, a high similarity between the NMR  spectral data of compounds 5 and 4 was observed.  The major difference was identiﬁ ed in the chemi- cal shifts attributed to H-4 of 5, which showed a  multiplet at δH 2.80 (2H, H-4). Furthermore, the  presence of a singlet at δH 3.88 (3H, H-10) sug- gested a methoxy substituent. A gHMBC correla- tion was observed between the signal at δC 161.2  (C-8) and H-10, which conﬁ rmed the position of  the methoxy group at C-8. This information cou- pled to literature data (Kamisuki, 2007) assigne 5  to the structure of 8-methoxymellein. The dihydroisocoumarin 6 was isolated as a  white amorphous solid and its ESI mass data in- dicated the molecular formula C10H10O4 ([M–H]–  at m/z 193). Considering differences in the NMR  spectral data between compounds 5 and 6, the 1H  NMR spectrum of 6 exhibited two ortho-coupled  hydrogen atoms at δH 6.73 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-7)  and δH 6.92 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-6), suggesting a  tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The 13C NMR and  DEPT 135o data indicated signals at δC 156.5 and  δC 143.0, which where attributed to the hydroxy- lated aromatic carbon atoms C-8 and C-5, respec- tively. These data indicate a hydroquinone ring in  the molecular structure of 6, which was identiﬁ ed  as 5-hydroxymellein (Harwood, 1984). Compounds 1 – 6 were evaluated for their an- tifungal activity against Cladosporium cladospo- rioides and C. sphaerospermum using a direct  bioautography assay (Table I). The most active  compounds, orcinol (1) and 4-hydroxymellein (4),  showed a potent effect towards the yeasts, exhib- iting a detection limit of 5.00 and 10.0 μg against  C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, re- spectively. 5 exhibited moderate fungitoxicity to- wards C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum,  showing a detection limit of 10.0 and 25.0 μg, re- Table I.

M. Oliveira et al. · Bioactive Metabolites from Penicillium Endophytes 829 spectively. 5-Hydroxymellein (6) proved to be not  potent, since the content at which this compound  showed activity was 50 μg. Altogether, these data  indicate a clear positive correlation between the  antifungal effect demonstrated by the dihydro- isocoumarins and free hydroxy groups at C-4 and  C-8. The identiﬁ cation of the compounds 1, 4 and  5, potentially bioactive against the phytopatho- genic fungi, indicates that they act as defence of  the host species against possible attacks of patho- gens. Although a broad spectrum of antimicrobial  activities has already been demonstrated for  compounds isolated from Penicillium, few stud- ies have been devoted to the acetylcholineste- rase (AChE) inhibitory activity. AChE catalyzes  the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to terminate the  impulse-transmitted action through cholinergic  synapses (Stryer, 1995; Sigurdsson and Gudbjar- nason, 2007). Although the fundamental reason  of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not clear so far,  AD is ﬁ rmly associated with impairment in the  cholinergic transmission. A number of AChE in- hibitors have been considered as candidates for  the symptomatic treatment of AD as the most  useful relieving strategy (Barbosa-Filho et al.,  2006; Alarcón et al., 2008). The diketopiperazine  2 exhibited the highest AChE inhibitory activity  displaying a detection limit of 10.0 μg (Table I).  Compounds 1 and 3 showed a detection limit of  60 μg, which was considered as weakly potent.  The dihydroisocoumarin 4 displayed moderate  AChE inhibitory activity, exhibiting a detection  limit of 30.0 μg. On the other hand, compounds  5 and 6 were not active (detection limits over  100 μg). Similar to the observed antifungal activ- ity, free hydroxy groups at C-4 and C-8 corrobo- rate to increase the anti-AChE potency presented  by dihydroisocoumarins. In conclusion, six metabolites from Penicillium  sp.1 and Penicillium sp.2, two endophytes associ- ated with A. macrophylla leaves, exhibited poten- tial bioactivity, including antifungal and AChE  inhibitory activities. The results suggest that com- pounds 2 and 4 should be considered further in  the development of new agrochemicals and/or  hit compounds for the use in the drug design for  Alzheimer’s disease treatment.
