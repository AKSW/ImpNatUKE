Abstract-  -The isolation  of (2OR)-2O-hydroxy-24-methylenedammar-3-one  from l&l/o;ia \tipir~~t(~ is described.  INTRODUCTION  Previous papers [I, 21 have dealt with the chemical study  of the hexane extract  of ~&&ia  sripiruta L. B. Smith 8~  Ayensu  which  led to the isolation  of a naphthalenic  norditerpene,  lupeol,  lupenone  and 22-hydroxy-21/IH-  hopan-3-one.  Subsequent  work  has  resulted  in the  isolation  of oleanolic  acid and a new triterpene  named  vellozone  (I) from the same extract. Vellozone, isolated in  0.6”~;, yield of the dry plant. had previously  been obtained  from I;. cllo$Jiu  Martius  [3].  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The molecular  formula ofvellozone  (1). C31H5202, mp  141”, was determined  by high  resolution  MS  [M+  observed  at  m/e 456.395020,  requires  456.396484].  Vellozone  gave a positive test with tetranitromethane  [4].  The  IR spectrum  presented  absorption  bands  for  hydroxyl.  carbonyl,  terminal  methylene  (1640 and  880cm-  ‘) and gem-dimethyl  groups  (1380cm  ‘).  The ‘H NMR spectrum  of 1 showed. irlter alia, signals  for five quaternary  methyl groups between (5 0.9 and 1.1, a  signal at 1.18 for a methyl  on the same carbon  as an  oxygen, and a doublet at 1.02 (6H, J = 7 Hz) assigned to  an Isopropyl group. Two broad singlets at 4.7 and 4.76 and  a signal at 1.38, which disappeared  upon the addition  of  deuterium  oxide, provided  further evidence for a terminal  methylene  and hydroxyl  group, respectively.  A detailed  study  of the 13CNMR  spectrum  of this  tetracyclic  triterpene  showed a signal at d 75.6, attributed  to C-20 which bears a tertiary hydroxyl group [5]. Signals  at 106.8 (t) and 157.4 (s) confirmed  the presence  of a  terminal  methylene  group. The signals at 50.6, 47.6, 40.4  and 37.0 for four quaternary  carbons,  and a singlet at  219.3 suggested that vellozone had a dammaraneskeleton  * Part  IX in the series  .‘The  Chemistry  of S.

The signals at 22.1 (y)  and 34.1 (d) can be attributed  to an isopropyl  group 1 to a  double  bond, thua characterizing  the nature of the side  chain [7].  Reduction  of vellozone with sodium borohydride  gave  a diol (2). This. upon acetylation  with acetic anhydride  and pyridine,  gave a monoacetate  (3) which presented  absorption  bands in the IR for a hydroxyl group as well as  the terminal  methylene  and acetate groups.  The ‘H NMR of3 showed signals for six quaternary  C-  Me groups. an isopropyl  group and one acetyl Me. The  double doublet at 64.5 (.I = 10 and 6 Hz) is characteristic  ofan acetyl carbinolic  proton x-oriented  in a cqclohexane  ring, and supported  the presence  of a 3-keto group  in  vellozone.  Analysis  of the MS of 1 and its derivatives  (Table 1 )  determined  the  nature  of the  tetracpclic  skeleton.  2486  Short Reports  2487  Table 1.

Cleavage of ring C of 1,2, and 3, gave  peaks at m/e 205,  207, and 249, respectively,  which limited  the choice of  skeletons  to the dammarane  group  and excluded  the  euphane  and lanostane  type skeletons  [8,9]. Rupture  of  the bond between C-17 and C-20 gave peaks at m/e 315,  317 and  359 for the cyclic  part  of the three  com-  pounds [lo] and another  at m/e 141, which in turn loses  water (m* at m/e 107.3 corresponds  to 141&123), for the  side chain.  The CD curve of 1 gave a weakly negative Cotton effect,  similar  to (20R)-20-hydroxydammar-24-en-3-one  [ll 1,  which made it possible to postulate  the A and B-rings as  being trans-anti-trans  with the C-5 hydrogen  cc-oriented.  Care had to be taken when working with vellozone  to  avoid epimerization  at C-20 (from  R to S). This was  observed  to occur  if, during  the  chromatographic  purification  of the extracts,  the compound  remained  in  contact  with the Si gel for several days. Ozonolysis,  in  CH,Cl,  at O”, of the epimer  gave Mills’ trisnorlactone  (4) [12,13], thus proving the R configuration  at C-20 in  vellozone. Thus vellozone  is assigned the structure  (20R)-  20-hydroxy-24-methylenedammar-3-one.  EXPERIMENTAL  Mps are uncorr.
