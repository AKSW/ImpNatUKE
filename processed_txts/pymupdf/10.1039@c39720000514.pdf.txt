514  J.C.S. CHEM. COMM., 1972  Constitutions of Rubrenolide and Rubrynolide: an Alkene-Alkyne Pair from  Nectandra mbra  By N. C. FRANCA  and 0. R. GOTTLIEB  (Laboratdrio de Produtos Naturais da Fundagiio de Amparo (z Pesquisa do Estado de Siio Paulo, Universidade de Siio Paulo,  Brasil)  and D. T. COXON  and W. D. OLLIS*  (Department of Chemistry, The University, Shefleld S3 7HF)  Summary Constitutions are proposed for rubrenolide (Ia)  and rubrynolide (Ib), two structurally novel natural  products isolated from Nectandra rubra (Lauraceae) .  THE trunk wood of the Amazonian tree, Nectandra rubra  (Mez) C. K. Allen1 of the Lauraceae family has yielded  rubrenolide and rubrynolide which represent a novel  natural product type.  Rubrenolide (Ia), C1&004,  m.p.  looo, [aID + Zl",  vco 1746 cm-l, was identified as a terminal alkene which, on  the basis of i.r. and n.m.r. evidence, is associated with a  -CH,-CH=CH,  group. Rubrynolide (Ib), C17H2804, m.p.  88", [aID + 21", vco 1746cm-l, was similarly shown  to be the corresponding terminal alkyne containing a  -CH2-CrCH group. On catalytic hydrogenation rubreno-  lide and rubrynolide each gave dihydrorubrenolide (Ic),  C1&20,,  m.p. 106-107",  [a]D + 22".  The two hydroxy-  groups present in rubrenolide were shown, using tri-  chloroacetyl isocyanate, to be primary and secondary, and  their vicinal relationship was established by periodate  cleavage of dihydrorubrenolide which gave formaldehyde  and an aldehyde, C16H2,03, m.p. 60-53"  (vco 1760 and  1720 cm-l). Intramolecular hydrogen bonding made a  direct deduction of the lactone ring size in rubrenolide un-  certain (vw 1745 cm-l), but the acetonide, C,oH3@4, m.p.  47-48",  prepared from dihydrorubrenolide, acetone, and  anhydrous copper sulphate was clearly a y-lactone (vco  1770 cm-l).  The C,,-skeleton of rubrenolide was deter-  mined by transforming dihydrorubrenolide to 4-methyl-  hexadecane (111) by the sequence : (i) reduction (LiAlH,), (ii)  formation of a tetramesylate, and (iii) hydrogenolysis  (LiAlH,) . Vigorous oxidation of rubrenolide with chromium  trioxide in boiling acetic acid gave sebacic acid,  H02C[CH,]8C0,H. Thus, two possible constitutions (IIa) or  (IIb) could be considered for rubrenolide, and a decision  between these was possible on the following evidence. Mild  oxidation of rubrenolide (Cr0,-HOAc ; room temp.) yielded  a vinylic (vet 1645,990, and 910cm-l) lactonic acid (vw 1760  and 1700 cm-l), C16HZ6O4,  m.p. 95-98"  (IIc), whose n.m.r.  spectrum showed an ABX system (HA T 7.05, HB T 7.49,  Hx m, T GU. 7.0; JBB 17-5, JAx  3.5, and JBx 8.5 Hz) whichhad  to be associated with the oxidatively generated carboxy-  group (HO,C-CHAHB-CHx<).  A corresponding ABX  system was also identifiable in the n.m.r. spectrum of the  lactonic acid methyl ester (IId).  These results established the constitutions of rubrenolide  (Ia) and rubrynolide (Ib) and these proposals were fully  confirmed by examination of the high resolution mass  spectra and n.m.r. spectra of the two compounds and their  derivatives. The assignment (Table) of seven 1H multiplets  observed in the 220 MHz n.m.r. spectrum (CD30D-D,O)  of dihydrorubrenolide (Ic) was made possible by spin-  decouding exDeriments.

COMM., 1972  515  The branched chained C,,-compounds, rubrenolide (Ia)  and rubrynolide (Ib) from Nectundru rubru (Lauraceae)  show an interesting biogenetic relation to the family of  structurally related linear C,,-compounds [e.g. (IVa) and  (IVb)] recently isolated from the seed of the avocado pear,  Perseu umericunu (Lauraceae) .  8  A proposed phytochemical  r e l a t i ~ n ~ , ~   between these two classes of C,,-compounds  isolated from Lauraceae may be extended to include some  Cll- and C13-compounds, (V)-(VII)  from Litseu odiferu.  The natural products (Ia), (IIa), (IVa), (IVb and related  compounds4), (V), (VI), and (VII) may all be derived as  biosynthetic variants upon the acetate-malonate route to  saturated fatty acids ;  7 the biogenetic correlation between  the natural product types (I) and (IV) is indicated by  numbers.
