The 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quin- olones in S. excelsa display strong similarities with those in Dictyolomatoideae, which contains several 2-alkyl-4-quinolones. The data reported herein thus provide ﬁrm support for placing Spathelioideae close to or within the Dictyolomatoideae. � 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction The placement of the genera Spathelia L. and Dictyo- loma Juss. has been doubtful since they were ﬁrst de- scribed in Linnaeus (1762) and in de Jussieu (1825), who assigned them to the Rutaceae. According to Ben- tham and Hooker (1862), Spathelia and Dictyoloma be- long to the order Simaroubaceae. Engler (1874) initially included these genera in the Simaroubaceae, but later moved them to the Rutaceae, placing Spathelia in the subfamily Spathelioideae and Dictyoloma in Dictyolo- matoideae (von Engler, 1931). In this paper, the isolation and identiﬁcation of six 2- alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones from the leaves of previously uninvestigated Spathelia excelsa (K. Krause) Cowan and Brizicky (1960) (syn. Sohnreyia K. Krause) are de- scribed. Their chemosystematic signiﬁcance is discussed in order to clarify the relationships between Spathelia and Dictyoloma. 2. Results and discussion The methanol extract from S. excelsa leaves yielded six new alkaloids 1–6, as well as the known 3-O-b-D- glucopiranosylsitosterol (Tandon et al., 1990) and (�)- epicatechin (Agrawal, 1989). Compound 1 showed UV absorption maxima at 242, 247, 324 and 335 nm, which is characteristic of a 2-alkyl- 4(1H)-quinolone (Tang et al., 1996). An elemental anal- ysis and ESI-MS indicated the molecular formula C23H33NO3. The IR spectrum showed a weak a,b-unsat- urated carbonyl band at 1632 cm�1, which can be ex- plained by a partially enolized carbonyl group. In addition to signals typical of 4(1H)-quinolone with an unsubstituted A ring (four aromatic protons at d 8.40, brd, J = 7.5 Hz; 7.28, brt, J = 7.5 Hz; 7.54, brt, J = 7.5 Hz; 7.73, d, J = 7.5 Hz), the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed a singlet at d 11.12 for N–H, a singlet 0031-9422/$ - see front matter � 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The spectrum did not show the signal for the conjugated oleﬁnic proton ca.d 6.22 (H-3), thus locating the methoxyl group at C-3. Based on the HMBC experiments (Table 2), the correlation ob- served between the 1H signal at d 8.40 and the 13C sig- nals at d 172.8, 131.1 (CH) and 138.6 led to their assignment as H-5, C-4, C-7 and C-8a, respectively. The latter resonance was coupled to the 1H signal at d 7.28, which showed cross peaks with the 13C signals at d 125.8 and 117.9, thus allowing these signals to be as- signed to H-6, C-4a and C-8. The 1H signals for H-5 and H-6 at d 8.40 and 7.28 showed one bond correla- tions with the 13C signals at d 125.5 and 122.8, respec- tively. The H-7 signal was assigned to d 7.54 by correlation with the 13C signal of C-8a (d 138.6). The remaining aromatic signal at d 7.73 was then attributed to H-8. This led to the formulation of 1 as a 3-methoxy- 4(1H)-quinolone (C10H8NO2). The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 3) revealed resonances for an aliphatic chain of thirteen carbon atoms containing a carbonyl group (d 210.0). From the HMBC experiments (Table 2), the cor- relation found between the methyl proton at d 2.14 (dC 30.0) and the 13C signal at d 210.0 and 43.8 (CH2 by DEPT 135) led them to be assigned as H3-13, C-12 and C-11, respectively, indicating that the carbonyl must be vicinal to C-13. The signals for H2-11 and H2-10 were established as d 2.43 (t, J = 7.3 Hz) and 1.54 m, respec- tively, due to their correlation with the 13C resonance for C-12 (d 210.0). Moreover, the correlation between the H2-11 signal and the 13C resonance at d 23.7 showed that d 23.7 could be attributed to C-10 (2J) or C-9 (3J).

Unambiguous 13C NMR assignments were also made to C-1 to C-3 and C-9 to C-11 based on COSY and HSQC experiments. However, the signals at d 29.1–29.5 for ﬁve methylenes (C-4–C-8) were not unequivocal; hence, it is possible they may be reassigned. The mass spectrum showed a fragment at m/z 175 (100%) due to ﬁssion of the side-chain between C-2 and C-1, resulting in a stable odd-electron ion [C23H33NO3 + H � C13H25O]+, 3-meth- oxy-4(1H)-quinolone. The downﬁeld signal at d 2.84 (t, J = 7.6 Hz; dC 29.9) from the methylene H2-1 was consistent with it is allylic connected in the 4(1H)-quino- lone system. The methoxyl proton at d 3.92 showed a cross-peak with the 13C signal at d 140.2, and was there- fore assigned to C-3. Moreover, a correlation between the methylene signal at d 2.84 assigned to H2-1 and the 13C resonance at d 140.2 and 147.8 conﬁrmed the presence of a methylene substituent at C-2, allowing for the assignment of the latter 13C signal at d 147.8 to C-2. The new alkaloid was therefore identiﬁed as 2- (12-oxo-tridecanyl)-3-methoxy-4-quinolone (1). The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C NMR spectrum with that of 2-(12-hydroxy-12- methyltridecanyl)-3-methoxy-4-quinolone (7), which was isolated for the ﬁrst time from Dictyoloma vandellia- num (Sartor et al., 2003). HMBC experiments on 1 led to a minor correction previously made in the 13C NMR assignments for 7; in the latter, the 13C signals of C-2 and C-3 had to be exchanged.

The 1H NMR spectra of 2–4 clearly indicated A and B rings similar to 1. The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 2–4 permitted the assignment of all hydrogen and carbon atoms of the 3-methoxy- 4(1H)-quinolone system (Tables 2 and 3). In compound 2, elemental analysis indicated the molecular formula C23H35NO3, requiring the presence of an aliphatic chain of thirteen carbon atoms when compared with 1. Hydro- xyl, methyl and ethyl groups must be connected to the same carbon in the side-chain due to the observed sig- nals for a hydroxytertiary carbon at d 73.1, a methyl sin- glet at dH 1.12, a methyl triplet at d 0.87 (J = 7.4 Hz) and a methylene quartet at d 1.45 (J = 7.4 Hz) in the 13C and 1H NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 3). The methyl signal at d 0.87 showed cross-peaks with the 13C reso- nances at d 73.1 and 34.3 (CH2, DEPT). The methyl sig- nal at d 1.12 showed a long-range correlation with two methylene resonances at d 34.3 and 41.1. These correla- tions indicated the presence of a structural unit, –CH2- C(CH3)(OH)-CH2-CH3, at the end of the side-chain. The signals at d 41.1 (d 1.37 m, by HSQC), 73.1 and 34.3 (d 1.45 q, by HSQC) were then assigned to C-9, C-10 and C-11 , respectively.

Spectra of 1–4 and 7 were run in CDCl3 and 5–6 in DMSO-d6. a–dAssignments may be interchanged in each column. A Data obtained in this study suggest that these resonances were previously assigned incorrectly (Sartor et al., 2003). B The signal for C-10 was established as d 24.3 by the existence of a negative c eﬀect of the hydroxy group; however, it was previously assigned incorrectly as C-9 (Sartor et al., 2003); hence, the 13C signals for C-9 and C-10 were interchanged. 1562 M. da Paz Lima et al. / Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 1560–1566 onances at d 8.3 and 26.4, respectively, led to their assignment to Me-12 and Me-13 . The slightly negative c eﬀect of the hydroxy group permitted the assignment of C-8 at d 23.6. The ESI-mass spectrum showed ions at m/z 356 [C23H35NO3 + H � H2O]+ and m/z 342 [C23H35NO3 + H � OH�Me]+, conﬁrming the presence of a 10-hydroxy-10-methyldodecanyl chain. Thus, the structure of the new alkaloid was characterized as 2- (10-hydroxy-10-methyldodecanyl)-3-methoxy-4-quino- lone (2). Compound 3 displayed a similar NMR spectrum to that of 2-(12-hydroxy-12-methyltridecanyl)-3-methoxy- 4-quinolone (7) (Sartor et al., 2003). The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 3 allowed for the assignment of all the hydrogen and carbon atoms. Elemental analy- sis and ESI-MS indicated the molecular formula C23H35NO3, conﬁrming that 3 diﬀered from 7 (C24H37NO3) only by removal of one CH2 group in the side-chain. Moreover, a correlation between the methylene signal at d 2.84 assigned to H2-1 , and the 13C resonances at d 140.2 and 148.1 permitted the assignment of the latter 13C signal at d 148.1 to C-2. These correlations for a homolog skeleton (3) conﬁrm that in 7 the 13C signals for C-2 and C-3 must be inter- changed. The complete assignments of chemical shifts for all carbons are given in Table 3. Compounds 1, 2, and 7 were used as models. The structure of 3 was thus elucidated as 2-(11-hydroxy-11-methyldodecanyl)-3- methoxy-4-quinolone. The 13C NMR spectrum of 4 (Table 3) revealed reso- nances for an aliphatic chain of thirteen carbon atoms containing a hydroxyl group (dC 68.3). Moreover, the 1H NMR spectrum showed an oxymethine proton at d 3.80 (sext, J = 6.2 Hz), which was coupled to the methyl doublet at d 1.19 (J = 6.2), indicating the hydroxyl group was located vicinal to C-13 and an unbranched side-chain. HMBC experiments showed correlations of the signal of H3-13 with the resonance of C-12 (d 68.3) and the 13C signal at 39.3 (CH2 by DEPT), leading to its assignment to C-11. The oxymethine proton at d 3.80 showed cross peaks with the 13C signal at d 25.7 (CH2 by DEPT), which was then assigned to C-10. From ESI-MS the ion observed at m/z 356 [C23H35NO3 + H � H2O]+ conﬁrmed the hydroxyl group in the side-chain. These data were consistent with the structure of 2-(12-hydroxytridecanyl)-3-methoxy-4- quinolone (4). Compound 5, C14H17NO3 (EA), exhibited signals typical of a 4-quinolone with a substituted A-ring. The 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of three aro- matic protons (dH 7.90, d, J = 9.0 Hz; 7.43, dd, J = 9.0 and 2.5 Hz; 7.47, d, J = 2.5 Hz). From HMBC experi- ments, the correlation observed between the 1H signal at d 7.90 and the 13C resonance at d 170.9 (3J) led to their assignment as H-5 and C-4, respectively, indicating the hydroxyl group is located at C-7 and permitting the assignments of the signals at d 7.43 and 7.47 to H-6 and H-8, respectively. The HSQC experiments allowed for the assignments of all CH atoms of the 4(1H)-quinolone system (Table 3). Moreover, the correlation between the 1H signal at d 6.68 (dC 105.1 by HSQC), assigned to H-3, and the 13C resonances at d 28.9 (CH2 by DEPET) and 156.9 suggested a methylene substituent at C-2 and led to the assignment of the former 13C signal at d 28.9 to C-1 and the latter d 156.9 to C-2. The signals for C-4a and C-8a were established as d 122.8 and 133.8, respec- tively, due to correlations of the ﬁrst 13C resonance d 122.8 and the 1H signals for H-5 and H-3 and the second d 133.8 with the 1H signal for H-5. The methylene signal at d 2.91 (t, J = 8.3; dC 28.9), assigned to H2-1, showed a long-range correlation with the 13C resonances at d 42.8 (CH2 by DEPET) and 68.9, which were attributed to C- 2 and C-3 , respectively, suggesting the presence of a hydroxytertiary carbon for C-3 . Thus, hydroxyl and two methyl groups must be connected at C-3 due to the signals for two methyl singlets at dH 1.17 (s, 6H, dC 29.5) in the 1H NMR spectrum. The ESI-mass spec- trum showed ions at m/z 230[C14H17NO3 + H � H2O]+ and m/z 174 [C14H17NO3 � C4H9O]+, conﬁrming the presence of an 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl chain. The structure of the new alkaloid was therefore characterized as 7-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-4-quinolone (5). Compound 6 exhibited a similar NMR spectrum to that of 5 (Tables 1 and 3). In addition to the signal de- scribed for the side-chain of 5, the 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of three aromatic protons (dH 7.37, d, J = 2.7 Hz; 7.12, dd, J = 8.8 and 2.7 Hz; 7.43, d, J = 8.8 Hz). From HMBC experiments, the correla- tion observed between the 1H signal at d 7.37 and the 13C resonance at d 176.2 (3J) led to their assignment as H-5 and C-4, respectively, indicating that the hydroxyl group is located at C-6 and allowing for the signals at d 7.12 and 7.43 to be assigned to H-7 and H-8, respec- tively. The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 6 permit- ted the assignment of all the hydrogen and carbon atoms (Tables 1 and 3). The ESI-mass spectrum also showed ions at m/z 230 [C14H17NO3 + H�H2O]+ and at m/z 174 [C14H17NO3 � C4H9O]+, conﬁrming that 6 diﬀered from 5 only by the position of the hydroxyl group in the A ring. The structure of 6 was thus deﬁned as 6-hy- droxy-2-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-4-quinolone. Spathelia and Dictyoloma are known to contain 2- quinolone alkaloids, prenylated chromones and limo- noids (Burke et al., 1972; Mester, 1983; Gray, 1983; Diaz et al., 1983; Suwanborirux et al., 1987; Vieira et al., 1988, 1990; Campos et al., 1987; Sartor et al., 2003). However, prenylated chromones have only been reported from the genera Spathelia, Dictyoloma and Harrisonia, as well as from the Cneoraceae, and Ptaer- oxylaceae (Gray, 1983). Harrisonia is a member of the Simaroubaceae, although it diﬀers from other genera M. da Paz Lima et al. / Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 1560–1566 1563 by its lack of quassinoids. Its limonoid constituents suggest a strong aﬃnity with rutaceous genera such as Spathelia (da Silva et al., 1984, 1987). Chromones have not been found in other Simaroubaceae or Rutaceae. Thus, according to Waterman (1983), the co-occurrence of chromones in these taxa is phylogenetically signiﬁcant by segregating them into a distinct group near the asso- ciated large family Rutaceae. Analysis of DNA sequence data from members of the Cneoraceae, Meliaceae, Ptaeroxylaceae, Rutaceae, and Simaroubaceae showed that the Rutaceae are paraphyletic, with Spathelia and Dictyoloma (Rutaceae), Harrisonia (Simaroubaceae), Cneorum (Cneoraceae), and Ptaeroxylon (Ptaeroxyla- ceae) forming a clade sister to all other Rutaceae. Cir- cumscription of Rutaceae to include all of these taxa was recommended (Chase et al., 1999; Scott et al., 2000). This analysis also indicated that the Sima- roubaceae and Meliaceae are the outgroups closest to Rutaceae (Chase et al., 1999; Scott et al., 2000). The 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone alkaloids that have recently been isolated from Dictyoloma vandellianum showed strong similarities to the Zanthoxyleae, which contain several 2-alkyl-4-quinolones. These data strongly sup- ported Chase and Scott�s taxonomic conclusions (1999, 2000) and permitted Sartor et al. (2003) to include Dict- yolomatoideae in Waterman�s phylogenetic diagram (1983) in a position between the proto-Rutaceae genera and the Spathelioideae, but close to the Zanthoxyleae (Sartor et al., 2003). These taxa, as separated small ﬁg- ures (an expression of the number of species in the tax- on), occupy a position between the advanced Rutaceae and Simaroubaceae (Fig. 1). Now, the ﬁnding of 2-alkyl- 4(1H)-quinolones in Spathelia excelsa shows strong sim- ilarities with Zanthoxyleae [Platydesma and Tetradium (T. ruticarpum = Euodia rutaecarpa)], Ruteae (Haplo- phyllum and Ruta), Boronieae (Boronia), Cusparieae (Raulinoa), Toddalieae (Acronychia, Vepris and Ptelea) and Dictyolomatoideae (Dictyoloma vandellianum), which contain several 2-alkyl-4-quinolones (Mester, 1983; Biavatti et al., 2002; Sartor et al., 2003). Thus, these data provide ﬁrm support for moving Spathelioi- deae close to or within the Dictyolomatoideae (Fig. 1). 3. Experimental 3.1. General NMR: Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as internal stan- dard; low resolution ESI-MSMS: Micromass Quattro LC instrument, equipped with a ‘‘Z-spray’’ ion source; IR: Bomen-Ft/IR; UV: Perkin–Elmer; Elemental analy- ses: on a EA 1108, CHNS-O (Fisons); [a]D: Perkin– Elmer 241 instrument. 3.2. Plant material Spathelia excelsa was collected in the Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke, Amazonas, Brazil, and identiﬁed by J.R. Pirani (Universidade de Sa˜o Paulo). A voucher specimen (4227) is deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisa da Amazoˆnia (INPA), Manaus, AM. 3.3. Isolation of compounds Ground leaves (2940 g) were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally with MeOH. The concentrated MeOH extract was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elu- tion with hexane, followed by a CH2Cl2–MeOH gradi- ent, yielded 16 frs. Fr. 14 was applied to silica gel, CC eluted with a CH2Cl2–MeOH gradient to aﬀord addi- tional frs (Fr.14A–C). Fr. 14A was subjected to further Si gel CC eluted with gel, CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2–MeOH 1:1, MeOH, and then Si gel CC using CH2Cl2–EtOAc as elu- ant to give additional frs. Fr. 14A.5 was reapplied to sil- anized silica (EtOAc), yielding a new fr. containing 1, with the latter puriﬁed by prep. TLC (silica gel, CH2Cl2–EtOAc, 6:4) to give 1 (10 mg). Fr. 14A.6 was subjected to ﬂash chromatography on silica gel eluted with a CH2Cl2–EtOAc–MeOH gradient to aﬀord 2 (14 mg), 3 (26 mg) and 4 (3 mg), respectively. Fr. 14B was applied to successive Si gel CC (eluant, CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2–MeOH 1:1, MeOH and then again on silica gel, CH2Cl2–EtOAc gradient) to give 3-O-b-D-glucopyr- anosylsitosterol (8 mg). Fr. 14C was also subjected to successive Si gel CC (Florisil), eluted with a CH2Cl2– MeOH gradient, and then silica gel, using CH2Cl2– Fig. 1. Waterman�s phylogenetic diagram of the Rutales, based on the distribution of secondary metabolites, is modiﬁed to remove the Spathelioideae subfamily, shifting it to close to the Dictyolomatoideae.
