The presence of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones in D. vandellianum shows strong simila- rities with the Zanthoxyleae, which contains several 2-alkyl-4-quinolones. Thus, the Dictyolomatoideae apparently occupies a position between the proto-Rutaceae genera and the Spathelioideae, but close to the Zanthoxyleae. # 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

D. incanescens DC), which occurs in Brazil, and D. peruvianum from Peru (Engler, 1874, 1931; Macbride, 1949). The taxonomy of this genus has been doubtful since its initial description in 1825, when Jussieu classiﬁed it in the Rutaceae, assign- ing it to the tribe Zanthoxyleae. According to the concept of Bentham and Hooker (1862), Dictyoloma belongs to the Simaroubaceae ‘‘ordo’’. Engler (1874) ﬁrst included this genus in the Simaroubaceae, but later removed it to the Rutaceae, classifying Dictyoloma as the single genus in the subfamily Dictyolomatoideae (von Engler, 1931). D. vandellianum is known to contain indole alkaloids, 2-quinolinone alkaloids, prenylated chromones, and limo- noids (Vieira et al., 1988, 1990; Campos et al., 1987). The occurrence of these compounds was important for sys- tematic classiﬁcation of the genus in the Rutaceae family. In this paper the isolation and identiﬁcation of ﬁve 2-alkyl- 4(1H)-quinolones from the leaves of D. vandellianum are described. The chemosystematic signiﬁcance of the pre- sence of limonoids, alkaloids, and chromones in Dictyo- loma in providing a better understanding of the phylgenetic relationships in the Rutales is also discussed. 2. Results and discussion The dichloromethane extract from the leaves of D. vandellianum aﬀorded ﬁve alkaloids 1–5, besides the known alkaloid 8-methoxyﬂindersine (Auzi et al., 1997) and b-sitosterol. Compound 1 showed the spectral characteristics of a 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone (Tang et al., 1996). Elemental analysis and ESI-MS indicated the molecular formula to be C27H43NO2. The IR spectrum showed a weak a,b-unsaturated carbonyl band at 1634 cm�1, which can be explained by the carbonyl group being partially eno- lized. The UV absorption maximum at 236, 314 and 325 nm suggested that N in the 4(1H)-quinolone system was unsubstituted, when compared with 2-tridecyl-4(1H)- quinolone (6) and 1-methyl-2-dodecyl-4(1H)-quinolone (Tang et al., 1996).

The two methyl doublets were coupled to the 1H signal at � 2.45 (sept, J=7.0 Hz), thus placing an iso- propyl group at the end of the side chain. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) revealed resonances for C-2–C-8 in close agreement with those for 2-tridecyl-4(1H)-quino- lone (6) (Tang et al., 1996), with an aliphatic chain of 16 carbon atoms. The two methyl doublets at � 1.20 and 1.12 and the 1H signal at � 2.45 showed one-bond correlations (HSQC) with the 13C signals at � 19.0 and � 35.0, permitting the assignment of these signals to iso- propyl group as Me-16/Me-17 and CH-15, respectively. HSQC experiments also showed a correlation from methyl singlet at � 1.40 to the 13C signal at � 26.1. Hydroxyl and methyl groups must be connected at the same carbon in the side chain, considering the observed signal for a hydroxytertiary carbon at � 82.2. This was supported by the ESI-MS data which showed fragments at m/z 326 [C27H43NO2+H�C5H12O]+ (40%) due to ﬁssion of the side chain between C-130 and C-140, thus indicating the hydroxyl and methyl groups to be located a (at C-140) to the isopropyl group. The signals at � 26.1 and � 82.2 were then assigned to C-180 and C-140, respectively. The downﬁeld signal at � 2.64 (t, J=7.8 Hz) from the methylene H2-10 was consistent with its situation being a to the 4(1H)-quinolone system. The observed correlation between this signal and the 13C signal at � 34.3 led to its assignment to C-10. Moreover, the 13C NMR spectrum also showed a downﬁeld signal at � 40.1, which was consistent for a methylene group with an electronegative element nearby; thus it was 186 C.F.P. Sartor et al. / Phytochemistry 63 (2003) 185–192 assigned to C-130. The slightly negative g eﬀect of the hydroxyl group permitted the assignment of C-110 at � 23.3. However, the signals at 28.8–29.6 for 10 methy- lenes (C-20–C-100 and C-120) were less readily assignable; indeed, the assignments may be interchanged with each other. In addition, HSQC experiments showed corre- lation from the signal in the oleﬁnic region at � 6.22 (s) to the 13C signal at � 108.5, suggesting a methine proton adjacent to double bond of the 4(1H)-quinolone system, which were assigned to H-3 and C-3, respectively, since C-2 is more deshielded than C-3 because of the deshielding eﬀect of the electronegative nitrogen. This evidence determined the position of the aliphatic chain at C-2. The new alkaloid was therefore identiﬁed as 2-(140- hydroxy-140,150-dimethylhexadecanyl)-4-quinolone (1). Compound 2 gave rise to UV (239, 330 and 348 nm) and IR (a weak carbonyl band at 1658 cm�1) spectra which indicated the presence of an 2-alkyl-4(1H)-qui- nolone nucleus. Elemental analysis and ESI-MS indi- cated the molecular formula to be C24H37NO3, requiring the presence of an aliphatic chain shorter than C16, when compared with 1. In the NMR spectrum of 2, four aromatic protons at � 8.40 (bd, J=8.0 Hz, H-5), 7.31 (dt, J=8.0 and 1.5 Hz, H-6), 7.51 (dt, J=8.0 and 1.2 Hz, H-7) and 7.59 (dd, J=8.0 and 1.5 Hz, H-8) (Table 1), clearly indicated an A ring similar to 1. The spectrum also revealed a singlet at � 3.92 corresponding to one methoxyl group. Furthermore, it did not show the signal for the conjugated oleﬁnic proton ca � 6.22 (H-3), thereby locating the methoxyl group at C-3. These data resulted in the construction of a 3-methoxy- 4(1H)-quinolone (C10H8NO2). Hydroxyl and two methyl groups must be connected at the same carbon in the side chain, since signals for a hydroxytertiary carbon at � 71.3 and two methyl singlets at �H 1.20 (s, 6H) and �C 29.2 in the 13C (Table 2) and 1H NMR spectra, respectively. The ESI-MS showed an ion at m/z 328 [C24H37NO3+H�C3H8O]+, conﬁrming the pre- sence of an 120-hydroxy-120-methyltridecanyl chain (C24H37NO3–C10H8NO2= C14H29O). 13C NMR assignments for 2 were made using 1 as model. The downﬁeld signals at � 43.7 (CH2, DEPT) and 29.2 (CH3, DEPT), which were appropriate for a methylene and methyl groups with an electronegative element nearby, were thus assigned to C-110 and C-130/C-140, respec- tively. Moreover, the slightly negative g eﬀect of the hydroxyl group permitted the assignment of C-90 at � 24.3. Thus, the structure of the new alkaloid was char- acterized as 2-(120-hydroxy-120-methyltridecanyl)-3- methoxy-4-quinolone (2).

Sartor et al. / Phytochemistry 63 (2003) 185–192 187 Compound 3 had NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) similar to 2, except for the absence of a signal for a methoxyl group, and the signal for H-3 was visible as a singlet at � 6.17. Elemental analysis and ESI-MS indi- cated the molecular formula to be C23H35NO2, con- ﬁrming that the diﬀerence between 3 and 2 is the absence of one methoxyl group at C-3. The presence of a 4(1H)-quinolone nucleus was also suggested by its UV (238, 325 and 335 nm) and IR (1657 cm�1) spectra. The observed signals for a hydroxytertiary carbon at � 71.2 and two methyl singlets at �H 1.20 (s, 6H) and �C 29.1 in the 13C (Table 2) and 1H NMR spectra, together with the ion at m/z 298 [C23H35NO2+H�C3H8O]+ in the ESI-MS, conﬁrmed the presence of an 120-hydroxy-120- methyltridecanyl chain. The complete assignment of chemical shifts for all carbons are given in Table 2. Using compounds 1 and 2 as models, the structure of 3 was elucidated as 2-(120-hydroxy-120-methyltridecanyl)- 4-quinolone. Compound 4, C28H45NO3 (EA/ESI-MS), also showed the UV (237, 288 and 335 nm) and IR ( 1636 cm�1) spectral characteristics of an 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra showed signals typical of a 3-methoxy-4-quinolone (�H 8.40, dd, J=8.0 and 1.0 Hz, H-5; 7.28, t, J=8.0 Hz, H-6; 7.55, t, J=8.0 Hz, H-7; 7.78, d, 8.0 Hz, H-8; 3.90, s, OMe; �C=147.6; C-3) very close related to those in 2, and of a 140-hydroxy-140,150- dimethylhexadecanyl side chain (�H 2.86, t, J=7.2 Hz, H-10; 1.68–1.72, m, H-20–H–130; 2.44, sept, J=7.0 Hz, H- 15; 1.10, d, J=7.0 Hz, Me-160/Me-170; 1.40, s, Me-180; �C 82.1, C-140); as in 1. This was supported by the mass spectrum, which showed fragments at m/z 356 [C28H45NO3+H�C5H12O]+ (80%) due to ﬁssion of the side chain between C-130 and C-140. The structure of this alkaloid was thus established as 2-(140-hydroxy-140,150- dimethylhexadecanyl)-3-methoxy-4-quinolone (4). Compound 5, C20H25NO2 (EA/ESI-MS), belonged to the same class of molecules as 1–4. The 4-quinolone skeleton was recognized on the basis of UV (240, 331 and 347 nm) and IR (1648 cm�1) spectra. In the 1H and 13C NMR spectra the absence of signals for N–H ca. � 10–12 and N–Me ca. �C 34, suggested the presence of a third ring. Compound 5 exhibited similar NMR spectra to dictyolomide A (7) (Lavaud et al., 1995). The 1H NMR revealed the presence of a methoxyl group (�H 3.93) and of three aromatic protons (�H 7.87, d, J=3.3 Hz; 7.26, dd, J=10.0 and 3.3 Hz; 7.52, d, J=10.0 Hz). From HMBC experiments (see Experimental), the observed correlation between the 1H signal at � 7.87 (d, J=3.3 Hz) and the 13C signal at � 176.5 (3J) led to their assignment as H-5 and C-4, respectively, thus indicating the methoxyl group to be located at C-6 and permitting the assignments of the signals at � 7.26 (dd, J=10.0 and 3.3 Hz) and 7.52 (d, J=10.0 Hz) to H-7 and H-8, respectively. Moreover, the existence of a correlation between the 1H signal at � 6.20, assigned to H-3, and the 13C signal at � 29.7 suggested a methylene substituent at C-2. This correlation, COSY experiments and the che- mical shift of a methylene at �C 51.5 indicated the pre- sence of a structural unit, –CH2–CH2–CH–CH2–N– in ring B (�H 2.97, dt, J=10.0 and 5.0 Hz, H-10a, 2.94, dt, J=10.0 and 5.0 Hz, H-10b, �C10 29.7; 2.07, m, H-20a, 1.48, m, H-20b, �C20 25.3; 2.07, m, H-30, �C30 33.7; �H 3.55, dd, J=12.0 and 10.2 Hz, H-40a, 4.26, dd, J=12.0 and 6.3 Hz, H-40b, �C40 51.5), conﬁrming a third ring as a piperidine substituent. The methylene signal at � 3.55 showed a long-range correlation (3J) with the methylene signal at � 34.1, suggesting the presence of a methylene at C-30 of piperidine ring. This methylene signal was coupled to another methylene signal at � 2.21, which was coupled to the oleﬁnic proton signal at � 5.33. The latter resonance was coupled to the 1H signal at � 5.45, which showed a one-bond correlation with the 13C sig- nal at � 133.0. The methyl proton at � 0.98 showed cross peaks with the 13C signals at � 133.0 (3J) and 20.8 (2J; CH2 by HSQC and DEPT). These correlations resulted in the construction of a C6H11 linear chain containing a disubstituted double bond between the third (C-300) and fourth (C-400) carbons. The cis-conﬁguration of the double bond was deduced from the small coupling Table 2 13C NMR chemical shifts for compounds 1–5 and model compounds 6 and 7 C 1 2 3 4 6 C 5 7 2 154.3 138.4 155.2 138.8 156.9 2 150.7 152.1 3 108.5 146.2 108.2 147.6 107.1 3 108.9 109.7 4 179.1 173.2 179.0 177.0 – 4 176.5 176.7 4a 125.1 125.9 124.9 125.9 124.6 4a 128.2 126.5 5 125.7 125.8 125.4 125.4 124.9 5 106.9 126.8 6 123.6 122.9 123.6 122.8 123.5 6 156.3 124.0 7 131.8 135.1 131.8 131.0 132.4 7 122.4 132.0 8 117.9 117.5 118.4 118.3 119.0 8 116.5 114.8 8a 140.3 140.4 140.6 140.3 140.3 8a 136.0 141.3 10 34.3 30.0 34.2 30.0 34.3 10 29.7 30.0 20 28.9 29.4 29.0 29.0 28.2 20 25.3 25.0 30 28.8 29.0 29.0 29.0 29.3 30 33.7 33.8 40 29.0 29.4 29.0 29.3 29.3 40 51.5 51.2 50 29.0 29.4 29.0 29.0 29.5 100 34.1 34.0 60 29.0 29.4 29.0 29.0 29.5 200 23.9 24.1 70 29.0 29.4 29.0 29.0 29.6 300 127.7 127.8 80 29.0 29.4 29.0 29.0 29.8 400 133.0 133.0 90 29.0 24.3 24.0 29.0 29.8 500 20.8 20.6 100 29.0 29.6 30.1 29.0 29.8 600 14.5 14.5 110 23.3 43.7 43.7 23.4 31.9 120 29.6 71.3 71.2 29.4 22.7 130 40.1 29.2 29.1 40.3 14.1 140 82.2 29.2 29.1 82.1 150 35.0 34.9 160 19.0 19.0 170 19.0 19.0 180 26.1 26.0 Ome 60.1 60.1 56.0 Spectra of 1–5 run at 100.6 MHz and 6–7 at 75 MHz.

Sartor et al. / Phytochemistry 63 (2003) 185–192 constant [J=10.6 Hz; J (cis)=7-11 Hz], and the chemical shift of the terminal methylene (� 20.6) shielded as in the cis-hex-3-ene at � 20.8 (Lavaud et al., 1995). The ESI-MS showed ions at m/z 228 [C20H25NO2+H�C6H12 (alkenyl chain)]+ (30%) and 189 [C20H25NO2+H�C9H15]+ (100%), conﬁrming the presence of a piperidine ring and a alkenyl chain at C-30. These data were consistent with the structure of 6-methoxydictyolomide A (5). A model shows that in the piperidine moiety, H-30 is not rigidly antiperiplanar with respect to one of the protons 2H-40. In the isomer in which H-30b is anti- periplanar to H-40a (J is large), the alkenyl chain is in a pseudoequatorial conformation (a). However, the large coupling constant of the C-40 methylene protons to H-30 is also consistent with their situation in a second isomer in which H-30a is antiperiplanar to H-40b (J is large), requiring the alkenyl chain to be in a pseudoequatorial conformation (b). The NOESY experiments showed correlations of H-40 at � 3.55 (J40-30=10.2) with H-20b at � 1.48. However, a spatial proximity of one H2-40 to H2-2 is possible for each of the isomers discussed above. When one of the H-40a and H-20a protons are in spatial proximity on the b-side, H-30 is on the a-side of the mole- cule, then the alkenyl chain is also on the b-side, but in a pseudoequatorial conformation. If it is presumed that H-30 is on the b-side in a pseudoaxial conformation, the other H-40ba and H-20ba are also in a spatial proximity. Therefore, these observations do not allow determination of the C-30 stereochemistry. However, compound 5 was presumed to be 30-(S)-6-methoxydictyolomide A based on the chemical shift of C-30 (�C 33.7) and its comparison with those of oblonginine (8, 25a-Me, �C 32.8), and shi- nonomenine (9, 25b-Me, �C 28.0) (Kadota et al., 1995). As a further conﬁrmation of the assignments, the synthesis of 5, under chiral control at C-30, is in progress. The results provide ﬁrm support for including the genus Dictyoloma in the Rutaceae. An examination of the systematic distribution of alkaloids, coumarins, limonoids, ﬂavonoids and chromones in the Rutales led Waterman (1983) to propose the biochemical evolution of the order. Limonoids and quassinoids, two bio- synthetically related compounds, are found in the Simaroubaceae, Meliaceae, Rutaceae, and Cneoraceae (da Silva et al., 1984, 1987). There are fairly consistent diﬀerences between the limonoids of the Rutaceae and those of the Meliaceae, the quassinoids being restricted to the Simaroubaceae. According to Waterman (1983), a consideration of other classes of secondary metabo- lites leads to the conclusion that Meliaceae, Cneoraceae, and Simaroubaceae have all evolved from proto-rutac- eous stock. Furthermore, the enormous variety of alka- loids and coumarins in the Rutaceae, not found in the other families, is taken to suggest that substantial che- mical evolution must have occurred in the diversiﬁca- tion of this large family after Cneoraceae, Meliaceae, and Simaroubaceae lines split oﬀ. In the Simar- oubaceae, Harrisonia is exceptional (da Silva et al., 1984, 1987), since no quassinoids have so far been iso- lated from it. Its limonoid types, however, suggest strong aﬃnity with rutaceous genera such as Spathelia. Besides, both Harrisonia and Spathelia contain chro- mones which have not been found in other Simar- oubaceae or Rutaceae, but do occur in the Ptaeroxylaceae and Cneoraceae (Waterman, 1983). These deductions were incorporated by Waterman (1983) into a phylogenetic diagram (Fig. 1). In 1983, the only phytochemical knowledge of Dictyoloma was the record of a simple indole (N,N-dimethyl-5-methoxy- tryptamine; Mester, 1983), of little value for the purpose of a taxonomic position of Dictyolomatoideae into Waterman’s phylogenetic diagram. The 2-quinolone alkaloids, limonoids, and chromones that have recently been isolated from Dictyoloma van- dellianum provide ﬁrm support for including the sub- family Dictyolomatoideae near the allied taxa Spathelioideae, Ptaeroxylaceae, Cneoraceae, and Harri- sonia (Vieira et al., 1988, 1990). Now, the ﬁnding of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones in D. vandellianum showed strong similarities with Zanthoxyleae [Platydesma and Tetradium (T. ruticarpum=Euodia rutaecarpa)], Ruteae (Haplophyllum and Ruta), Boronieae (Boronia), Cus- parieae (Raulinoa), and Toddalieae (Acronychia,Vepris andPtelea), which contain several 2-alkyl-4-quinolones (Mester, 1983; Biavatti et al., 2002). Dictyoloma,Te- tradium, Raulinoa, and Vepris also produce limonoids (Vieira et al., 1988, 1990; Ng et al., 1987; Biavatti et al., 2001; daSilva et al., 1984, 1987), suggesting a relative advance. These phytochemical data are in line with the view of Waterman (1987) who consider genera of the Rutaceae, which produce the full range of advanced rutalean metabolites (furoquinoline alkaloids, coumar- ins and limonoids), as arising from a progenitor with the metabolic proﬁle of Tetradium. Interestingly, de Jussieu (1825) classiﬁed the genus Dictyoloma in the same tribe of Tetradium, Zanthoxyleae. Thus, in Waterman’s phyloge- netic diagram (Fig. 1), Dictyolomatoideae apparently occupies a position between the proto-Rutaceae genera and the Spathelioideae, but close to Zanthoxyleae. This interpretation of chemical data is consistent with available DNA sequences. The analysis of DNA sequence data from members of the Cneoraceae, Melia- ceae, Ptaeroxylaceae, Rutaceae, and Simaroubaceae, showed that the Rutaceae are paraphyletic, with Spa- thelia and Dictyoloma (Rutaceae), Harrisonia (Simar- oubaceae), Cneorum (Cneoraceae), and Ptaeroxylon (Ptaeroxylaceae) forming a clade sister to all other Rutaceae. Circumscription of Rutaceae to include all of these taxa was recommended. This analysis also indi- cated that the Simaroubaceae and Meliaceae are the outgroups closest to Rutaceae (Chase et al., 1999; Scott et al., 2000). C.F.P.

Isolation of compounds Ground leaves (300 g) were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally with MeOH. The conc. CH2Cl2 extract was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with hexane, followed by a CH2Cl2–EtOAc–Me2CO–MeOH gradient yielded eight frs. Fr. 2 was subjected to cellu- lose chromatography eluting with a hexane–CH2Cl2– EtOAc gradient to aﬀord 8-methoxyﬂindersine (3 mg) and additional frs. Fr. 2.1 was applied twice (Sephadex LH-20, EtOAc; then silica gel, hexane–CH2Cl2–EtOAc gradient) to give b-sitosterol (13 mg). Fr. 5 was sub- jected twice to Sephadex LH-20 (CHCl3–MeOH, 1:1) yielding new frs., with Fr. 5.2, following ﬂash chroma- tography on silica gel eluting with a CH2Cl2–EtOAc– MeOH gradient, aﬀording new frs. Fr. 5.2.1 was applied to Sephadex LH-20 (EtOAc) to give 1 (8 mg) and a new fr. containing 2. The latter was puriﬁed by prep. TLC (silica gel, CH2Cl2–EtOAc, 6:4) to give 20 mg of 2. Fr. 5.3 was subjected three times to Sephadex LH-20 (CHCl3–MeOH, 1:1; MeOH; EtOAc) to aﬀord a new fr., which was puriﬁed by prep. TLC (silica gel; CH2Cl2–MeOH, 1:1) to yield 3 (5 mg) and 4 (5 mg). Fr. 6 was applied to Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH, aﬀording a fr. containing 5. It was then pur- iﬁed by prep. TLC (silica gel; CHCl3–MeOH, 95:5) to give 12 mg of 5. 3.3.1. 2-(140-Hydroxy-140,150-dimethylhexadecanyl)-4- quinolone (1) Yellow gum; [a]D+3� (CHCl3; c 0.2); UV lmax (MeOH) nm: 236, 314, 325; IR nmax (CHCl3) cm�1: A weak carbonyl band at 1634 cm�1 can be explained by the carbonyl group being present partially enolized; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): see Table 1; 13C NMR/ DEPT (100 MHz, CDCl3): see Table 2; HSQC (400/100 MHz, CDCl3); COSY (400 MHz, CDCl3).
