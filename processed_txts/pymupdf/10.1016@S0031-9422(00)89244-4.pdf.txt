INTRODUCTION  In a previous paper on an Aniba sp. (Lauraceae), the  occurrence of the 9 benzofuranoid  neolignans  la, lc, lf,  2a. &I, 3a, 3h, 4d and 4f was described. Inspection of their  structures and interconversions  by pyrolysis led to the  postulate that these compounds  belong to series whose  representatives  can be linked by sequential Cope, retro-  Claisen  and Claisen  rearrangements,  e.g. la + 2a -+  3a, 2d + 4d, If + 4f, and that, consequently, the missing  links &I, 2f and 3f, as well as a precursor of 3b, should  occur naturally [2].  One of the objectives of the present re-investigation  thus concerned  the isolation  and description  of such  compounds.  A new examination  of the species was  desirable anyway, since in the original paper the absolute  stereochemistry at C-2 and C-3 had been established with  certainty only for the 2,3-truns-dihydrobenzofuranoids  la, 2a, 2d, 3a, 3b and 4d [2]. The relative configuration of  the C-3 vicinal chiral centers in compounds of type 1 was  since deduced by i3C NMR [3], and thus the absolute  stereochemistry of la is now known. The technique proved  of no help, however, in the analysis of the chirality at C-5  of compounds  of type 2, and this feature, aa well as the  absolute  stereochemistry  of the 2,3-cis-dihydrobenzo-  furanoids lc, If and 4f, remained to be investigated  * Part 39 in the series ‘The Chemistry of Brazilian Laurace.ae’.

The distribution  of 14 neolignans (Table 1) shows  that the chemical composition  of specimens numbered  42 237 [2], 46 7% and 46 800 can be considered identical,  six of their neolignans bearing a 3,4,5_trimethoxyphenyl  and  5 a 3-methoxy4,5-methylenedioxyphenyl  sub-  stituent The composition of a specimen 46 798 is peculiar,  in so far as all six isolated compounds bear a 3-methoxy-  4,5_methylenedioxyphenyl  substituent.  Thus, the present work led indeed to the expected  intermediates  (34 2f and 3Q and precursor (2b). Com-  pound 5 was obtained  concommitantly.  Since it was  observed, however, that 4f (but not 4d) decomposed into  5 during silica gel TLC, the natural occurrence of this  benzofuran derivative is not assured. The constitutions  of these five compounds were deduced by spectral com-  parison with known analogous derivatives. For the com-  pounds of series 1 [l, 2, 5-7],2 [l, 2,6,7],3  [l, 2 71 and  4 [2, 7] several models are available. These can be used,  inclusively, in conformational  and configurational  corre-  lations. As has been pointed out [2, 51, and is apparent  again in Table 2, the relative shielding of the Me-3  protons by the vicinal Ar reveals the cis relation of these  groups. It is in this case (6) that H-2 is relatively de-  shielded and must, thus, lie closer to the O-C=C--C=O  (in 1 and 2) or O-Ar  (in 3 and 4) plane than in the 2,3-  tran.v isomers (7). The identification  of 5 relied only on  data of two models [1,7]. The sequence ofsubstituents  on  742  C. J. AIBA et al.  Table 1.

It became clear, subsequently, after shifting of  the signals into an interference free region by the LIS technique, that they are doublets_ The signals at 4.54 and 3.95 [Z] represent,  respectively, H-7 and H-4.  Ar  H  H  Ar  7  Me  H  H  ti  the benzene ring of the benzofuran  system must be,  nevertheless, correct, in view of the following evidence.  First, a pyridine induced PMR solvent shift [S] demon-  strated the vicinity of the allyl-CH,  (AT 0.28 ppm) and  the hydroxyl.  This forms an intramblecular  hydrogen  bridge [9] to themethoxyl oxygen [V(CH,ClJ 3530 cm-‘.  invariant  upon dilution].  Finally, double irradiation  at  Neolignans from Anibu simulans  743  the PMR methoxyl frequency (T 6.05) caused a 23 % NOE  enhancement  of the intensity of the aromatic H singlet at  .r 3.20.  The proposed structures were confirmed by synthesis.  This involved precursors  of established  structure  [2],  which were subjected to pyrolysis (2d + 3d, If + 2f -+  3f + 4f. 8) or air oxidation (4f -P 5). The Cope rearrange-  ment of If + 2f is of special significance. Indeed, since  the relative configuration  of If is known [3] and the  thermal reaction operates by suprafacial ally1 migration,  the relative configuration  of the product can only be  expressed as in 2f.  In additional interconversions,  acid isomerization of 31  and 4f (negative Cotton effects at 290 nm) led, as expected,  respectively  to 3d and 4d (positive Cotton  effects at  290 nm). Clearly, this reaction proceeds by epimerization  only  of C-2. Absolute  configurations  can thus be  formulated not only for 3f and 4f, but also for the addi-  tional 2,3-cis-derivatives  If and 2f, on account of the  aforementioned  conversion to 3f, and for lc, whose ORD  curve is superimposable  on the analogous curve of If.  Deduction of the absolute configuration  of 2a, 2b and  2d will be part of a forthcoming general discussion on the  stereochemistry of benzofuranoid  neolignans  EXPERIMENTAL  Isdation ofthe constituents. All plant material was collected at  Ducke Forest Reserve, Manaus, Amazonas. The procedure  used for Herbarium (INPA, Manaus) Specimen No 46798 is  typical. Powdered wood (8 kg) was percolated at room temp.  with CsH,. The extract (70 g) was freed of fatty esters (2.2 g) by  washing with petrol and chromatographed on a Si gel column,  giving the following fractions with C,H,-AcOEt  mixtm  of the  indicated vol/vol compositions : A (1: O), B (9 : l), C (8 : 2), D (6 : 4),  E (4 : 6). A (4.3 g) was separated by TLC (petrol+H,  3 : 7) into  benzyl benzoate and benzyl salicylate. B (2.8 g) was separated by  TLC (C,H,-AcOEt,  98 :2), in order of increasing R,, into a 7 : 3  mixt. of3d and 3(250 mg) and 5 (30 mg). The mixture was septd  by fractional cry&. from MeOH. The initial fractions contained  pure 3d. C (3.6 g) is mainly sitosterol. D (20.6 g) was septd by  filtration into crystalline If (10 g). The oily filtrate was septd by  TLC (E&O), into If (R, 0.19)and  a 7:3 mixt of 2d &d if  (Rr 0.58). The mixture was sentd bv Al,O, TLC fEt,O) into 26  (2b mg) and 2f (50 mg).
