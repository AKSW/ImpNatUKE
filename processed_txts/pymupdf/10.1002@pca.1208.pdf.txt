Yostc ABSTRACT: Introduction – Melia azedarach adapted to cool climates was selected as rootstocks for vegetative propagation of Azadirachta  indica. Cleft grafting of A. indica on M. azedarach rootstock showed excellent survival. Little is known about the chemistry of  grafting. Objective – The roots, stems, leaves and seeds of this graft were examined in order to verify if grafted A. indica would produce  limonoids diff erent from those found in non-grafted plants. Intact matured fruits were also studied to verify if they were free  of meliatoxins. Methodology – After successive chromatographic separations the extracts aff orded several limonoids. HPLC-MS/MS and  MALDI-MS were used to develop sensitive methods for detecting azadirachtin on all aerial parts of this graft and meliatoxins  in fruits, respectively. Results – The stem aff orded the limonoid salannin, which was previously found in the oil seeds of A. indica. Salannin is also  found in the root bark of M. azedarach. Thus, the fi nding of salannin in this study suggests that it could have been translocated  from the M. azedarach rootstock to the A. indica graft. HPLC-MS/MS analyses showed that azadirachtin was present in all parts  of the fruits, stem, fl owers and root, but absent in the leaves. The results of MALDI-MS analyses confi rmed the absence of  meliatoxins in graft fruits. Conclusion – This study showed that A. indica grafted onto M. azedarach rootstock produces azadirachtin, and also that its  fruits are free of meliatoxins from rootstocks, confi rming that this graft forms an excellent basis for breeding vigorous Neem  trees in cooler regions.

Azadirachtin  is found in three species, the trees Azadirachta indica A. Juss.,  A. excelsa (Jack) Jacobs and A. siamensis Val. (Meliaceae)  (Morgan, 2009). The seeds, fruit, fl owers, leaves, twigs, bark  and roots of the Indian neem tree, A. indica, have all been  examined. Among the more polar limonoids, extracted with  azadirachtin, salannin (2, Scheme 1) is the most abundant,  followed by azadirachtin. Morgan (2009) also showed that there  are other feeding deterrents present in the seeds in smaller  quantities. Unfortunately, Rembold (1989) introduced the names azadi- rachtin A, B, C and D, describing these as isomers. Azadirachtin A  is identical to azadirachtin, therefore the original name stands.  Since the structure of azadirachtin B was determined by Klenk  et al. (1986) and named 3-tigloylazadirachtol, that name stands.  Azadirachtin C was never fully described, thus the name is  unused. Azadirachtin D is correctly 1-tigloyl-3-acetyl-11-hydrox- ymeliacarpin. These three compounds belong to diff erent com- pound groups and are not isomers (Morgan, 2009). Later, the  authors isolated the limonoids from the meliacarpin groups,  naming them as azadirachtin E, F, G; however, the correct names  M. R. Forim et al. www.interscience.wiley.com/journal/pca  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Phytochem. Anal. 2010, 21, 363–373 364 are 1-detigloylazadirachtin, 1-hydroxy-3-tigloyl-11,19-deoxo-11- hydroxymeliacarpin and 3-tigloyl-13,14-desepoxy-17-hydroxy- azadirachtol, respectively (Kraus, 1995, 2002). Azadirachtin is biologically interesting because it is a feeding  deterrent for some insects and a growth disruptant for most  insects, and many other arthropods and species in related phyla.  Moreover, it is remarkably non-toxic to vertebrates (Morgan,  2009). In contrast, bark and seeds of the Chinaberry tree (in  Portuguese, cinamomo and Santa-Bárbara), Melia azedarach L.,  are reported to be poisonous to farm and domestic animals and  humans. Oelrichs et al. (1983) showed that a series of limonoids,  meliatoxins A1, A2, B1 and B2 are the poisonous principles. The Neem tree is well adapted to hot, dry climates where  shade temperatures often reach 50°Celsius and annual rainfall  ranges from 400 to 1200 mm. It is native to the Indian sub-con- tinent, but also grows well in other tropical and subtropical areas  around the world (Verkerk and Wright, 1993). It was successfully  introduced in northern, northeastern and western regions of  Brazil (Martinez, 2002). Chinaberry tree is native to Asia and was  extensively introduced in Brazil as an ornamental plant. These  trees are potentially better suited to survive low temperatures  than the Neem trees. The latter has been grafted to stems of  M. azedarach and the tree has adapted well to cool climates.  These grafts growing in the southern regions of Brazil are part of  a breeding and selection programme in the Agronomic Institute  of Paraná (Brazil) aimed at the development of vigorous Neem  trees to be established in cooler regions. This is the fi rst time that the graft of A. indica on M. azedarach  rootstock has been investigated. Thus, the roots, stems, leaves  and seeds of this graft were examined in order to verify if grafted  A. indica would produce limonoids diff erent from those found in  non-grafted plants. Detection of azadirachtin from all parts of  Neem trees have been described in the literature (Sundaram,  1996), but it has been frequently reported to be present at  highest concentrations in mature seeds (Akhila and Rani, 1999).  In order to verify if azadirachtin was still present in the graft,  a sensitive method was developed for detecting it on all aerial  parts of this graft. Figure 1.

Anal. 2010, 21, 363–373  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  www.interscience.wiley.com/journal/pca 365 Plantations of Neem trees have been established in Brazil,  specifi cally to provide the oil from fruits for the production of  natural insecticides and cosmetic products. The main grafting  problems of A. indica on M. azedarach are related to meliatoxins  A1, A2, B1 and B2, which once biosynthesized in the rootstock,  could be translocated to seeds. These comments have encour- aged the development of a rapid and sensitive method for deter- mination of meliatoxins in seeds from M. azedarach and A. indica,  developed from the germination of seeds and from the graft.  Thus, this study focused on selecting a proper matrix for melia- toxins, to study the ionization and fragmentation patterns of  meliatoxins in a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass  spectrometry (MALDI MS) system, and to develop a simple pro- tocol for the use of MALDI-MS to analyse meliatoxins from seeds  with minimal purifi cation of the samples. Experimental Plant material Leaves, stem, fl owers and fruits from a graft of A. indica on M. azedarach  were collected at the experimental campus of the Agronomic Institute of  Paraná, Xambrê-PR, Brazil. The plant was identifi ed by Dr. Sueli de Souza  Matinez. A voucher specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of the State  University of Maringá PR, Brazil, number 11709-HUM. Instrumentation The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted  of two Shimadzu LC-10AD pumps (Kyoto, Japan), a SUS (Stainless steel)  mixer, an SIL-10AF (SIL, automatic sample injector) autosample injector,  an SPD-10A (SPD, spectrophotometric detector) UV–vis detector and  an SPD-10AVP photodiode array detector. A CBM-10A (CBM, commun- ications bus module) interface was applied to both detectors. Data  acquisition was performed using CLASS LC10 software. Solid-phase  extraction (SPE) clean-up was performed on a vacuum manifold proces- sor (Varian, Harbor City, CA, USA) using a vacuum bomb TE-058 (Tecnal,  Piracicaba, SP, Brazil). One- and two-dimensional NMR spectra were  recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany;  1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz), 2695 HPLC (Waters, Manchester, UK) coupled  with a Quattro LC mass spectrometer and a ThermoFinnigan (San Jose,  CA) LTQ with vMALDI source (LTQ is ThermoFinnigan’s proprietary name  for their linear 2D quadrupole ion trap). Isolation of compounds Ground leaves (2.3 kg) and roots (1.2 kg) from a graft of A. indica on  M. azedarach were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and fi nally with  MeOH, although the stem (1.3 kg) was only extracted with MeOH, all at  room temperature and repeated three times. The concentrated MeOH  extract (31 g) from the stem was partitioned into hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc  and n-BuOH soluble fractions. The 1H NMR spectra of these partitions  showed that most of the limonoids were in the CH2Cl2 fraction. Thus, the  CH2Cl2 fraction was chromatographed over silica gel (230–400 mesh,  CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient) to aff ord four fractions. Fraction 2 was  rechromatographed as above (CH2Cl2–Me2CO–MeOH gradient) yielding  four new fractions. The 1H NMR spectrum of the new fraction 3 showed  that it was rich in limonoids. This fraction was submitted to HPLC separa- tion using a semipreparative HPLC column [Phenomenex Phenyl Hexyl,  250 × 6 mm column, 10 μm; H2O–acetonitrile (6.5 : 3.5), fl ow-rate 4 mL/ min, UV = 217 and 254 nm] yielding 28-deoxonimbolide (3; 2 mg), salan- nin (2; 7 mg) and 6-O-acetylnimbandiol (4; 4.5 mg). The concentrated hexane and CH2Cl2 extracts from the leaves were  combined (70 g) and chromatographed on silica gel and Florisil (1 : 1)  eluting with hexane–EtOAc–MeOH gradient to remove chlorophyll.  During concentration of the EtOAc fraction, a crystalline material sepa- rated and was then collected and crystallized from EtOAc to give limonoid  nimbolide (5; 11 mg). The 1H NMR (200 MHz) of all fractions showed  signals that are characteristic of steroids and known limonoids: the  fractions were not analysed any further.

Limonoids from A. indica grafted on M. azedarach, and their biogenetic pathways. M. R. Forim et al. www.interscience.wiley.com/journal/pca  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Phytochem. Anal. 2010, 21, 363–373 366 (182 g) from the leaves showed signals from the aromatic protons at 1H  NMR spectrum; this was then investigated. It was then partitioned into  hexane, CH2Cl2-, EtOAc- and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. The CH2Cl2-soluble  fraction was purifi ed by repeated column chromatography as above to  give two fractions (A and B) containing limonoids. Fraction A was chro- matographed on octadecylsilica (ODS) column (fractions were eluted by  gravity fl ow with H2O–MeOH 7 : 3, 1 : 1; MeOH; MeOH–acetonitrile 9 : 1,  7 : 3; acetonitrile) yielding 28-deoxonimbolide (3; 16 mg). Fraction B was  chromatographed three times over gel permeation Sephadex LH 20  (MeOH; MeOH; MeOH-Me2CO 1 : 1) to give 6-deacetylnimbinene (6;  1.4 mg) and 6-deacetylnimbin (7; 7 mg). The EtOAc-soluble fraction was  chromatographed on microgranular cellulose (hexane–CH2Cl2–MeOH  gradient) aff ording further fractions. Fractions 10 and 11 were purifi ed by  gel permeation column chromatography (Sephadex LH 20, MeOH)  aff ording quercetin (18 mg) and a new fraction C. This fraction C was  submitted to preparative HPLC [Shodex Asahipack. GS-310 polymeric  column (50.0 × 2.5 cm i.d.); MeOH, fl ow-rate 1 mL/min, UV = 217 nm] to  yield quercitrin (4.3 mg). The 1H NMR spectra of the hexane, dichloromethane and methanol  extracts from the roots showed that most of the limonoids were in the  CH2Cl2 fraction. This was chromatographed over silica gel (230–400 mesh,  hexane–CH2Cl2–Me2CO–MeOH gradient), yielding 21 fractions contain- ing known limonoids. Only fractions 6 and 7 were submitted to HPLC  separation using a semipreparative HPLC column [Phenomenex Phenyl  Hexyl, 250 × 6 mm column, 10 μm; H2O–acetonitrile (6.5 : 3.5), fl ow-rate  4 mL/min, UV = 217 and 254 nm] to yield nimbolin A (8; 6.1 mg). Extraction and isolation of standard azadirachtin Matured fruits of A. indica were collected at the experimental campus  of Agronomic Institute of Paraná, Xambrê-PR, Brazil, in April, 2005.  Fully matured fruits were manually depulped and the mesocarp  adhering (seed coat) to the hard epicarp was removed, thereby obtaining  the seed kernels. The air-dried powdered seed kernels (800 g) were  extracted with hexane through percolation processing at room tempera- ture four times, and for 1 h each, using mechanic agitation and cen- trifugation. Oil supernatant was transferred into the other vial, and  then discarded. The precipitate was extracted with methanol through  percolation processing at room temperature fi ve times, and for 12 h each,  using mechanical agitation and centrifugation. A crude methanolic  extract (52 g) was obtained after fi ltration and evaporation of the  organic solvent under vacuum at 40°C. A portion of the resultant  methanolic extract (25 g) was chromatographed over silica gel (230–400  mesh, CHCl3–acetonitrile–MeOH gradient) yielding a fraction rich in  azadirachtin. This fraction was chromatographed over gel permeation  Sephadex LH 20 (MeOH) to give further fractions. The 1H NMR (200 MHz)  of the all fractions showed characteristics of azadirachtin in fraction 6,  and then, it was submitted to semi preparative HPLC [Phenomenex  Luna Phenyl Hexyl, 250 × 6 mm column, 10 μm; acetonitrile–MeOH–THF– H2O (34 : 4 : 1 : 61), fl ow-rate 1.8 mL/min, UV = 217 and 254 nm] to  yield azadirachtin (1; 47 mg). The standard was prepared in triplicate at  10 μg/mL and 20 μL was injected to the HPLC system to confi rm its  purity. The optimal condition consisted of an isocratic solvent system  containing acetonitrile–MeOH–THF–H2O (34 : 4 : 1 : 61; THF: tetrahydrofu- ran), employing a reverse-phase analytical C18 column (Phenomenex- Luna II; 150 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm) equipped with a precolumn (Phenomenex;  4 × 3 mm, 5 μm), at a fl ow-rate of 0.4 mL/min, UV = 217 nm and an injec- tor fi tted with a 20 μL loop. Sample preparation for azadirachtin detection Immature, juvenile, matured and fully matured fruits were collected in  April, 2005. Juvenile, matured and fully matured fruits (samples B–D,  respectively) were manually depulped and the mesocarp adhering  (seed coat) to the hard epicarp was removed, hence obtaining the seed  kernels. The juvenile (B, 100 mg), matured (C, 100 mg) and fully matured  (D, 100 mg) seed kernels frozen in liquid nitrogen were ground separately  using a mortar and pestle. Intact immature fruits (sample A, 346.8 mg)  were also ground as above. Some seeds were dried in an air-oven at 60°C  for 24 h and then the seed coat (sample F; 304.7 mg) and kernels (sample  E; 100 mg) were separated, and were separately ground. All samples (A–F)  were mixed separately with 1 mL of methanol in centrifuge tubes by  vortex agitation (Phoenix AP56, Araraquara, SP Brazil) for 30 s at the  maximum possible speed, and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm at 20°C for  20 min (Joan B4i/BR41, St-Herblain, France). The supernatants were trans- ferred into the sample vial. The precipitate was transferred into centrifuge  tubes and was extracted two times as above and the supernatants trans- ferred into the same sample vial. The samples were evaporated in a  speed-vac aff ording the concentrated extracts A–F. The ground dry stem  without bark (sample G, 184.2 mg), stem bark (sample H, 176.0 mg),  leaves (sample I; 316.4 mg) and fl owers (sample J; 185.0 mg) were  extracted by the same procedure aforementioned. To obtain initial information about the retention time of the analyte  (azadirachtin) and the compounds in the crude methanol extracts, a  screening analysis was performed with the extract E. Thus, 1.2 mg of  crude extract E in 1 mL of MeOH and 80 μg/mL (MeOH) of azadirachtin  were separately submitted to the HPLC analyses using a reverse-phase  analytical octadecyl (C18) column (Phenomenex-Luna II; 150 × 4.6 mm i.d.,  5 μm) equipped with a precolumn (Phenomenex; 4 × 3 mm, 5 μm), using  a gradient elution with acetonitrile in water (5–100% in 60 min) at a fl ow- rate of 2 mL/min and an injector fi tted with a 20 μL loop. The eluant was  monitored at 217 nm detection wavelength under ambient temperature.  Based on the chromatogram results, clean-up procedures were carried  out with all concentrated extracts. Therefore, all concentrate extracts  were reconstituted in 400 μL of hexane to remove remaining oils and  other no-polar material (A, 7.2 mg, 18.0 mg/mL; B, 7.9 mg, 19.75 mg/mL;  C, 7.7 mg, 19.25 mg/mL; D, 9.1 mg, 18.20 mg/mL; E, 7.0 mg, 17.50 mg/ mL; F, 2.6 mg, 13.00 mg/mL; G, 9.0 mg, 18.00 mg/mL; H, 15.6 mg,  22.30 mg/mL; I, 12.0 mg, 20.00 mg/mL; and J, small amount). The cleanup  of each extract was performed by applying this solution onto a cyano- propyl SPE cartridge of 1 mL per 100 mg (Bakerbond® Spe Cyano, J.T.  Baker) previously conditioned with 5 mL of hexane, which was not dried.  The residue of the concentrate extract was dissolved in a further 200 μL  of hexane and also passed through the same cyanopropyl SPE cartridge  and then washed with 4 mL of hexane. The solvent was removed from  the cartridge on a Vacuum manifold bomb and afterwards the tube  was dried. The residue of the concentrate extract after hexane washing  was twice reconstituted in 600 μL and then in 400 μL of MeOH; both  fractions were passed through the same cyanopropyl SPE cartridge. The  solvent was removed from the cartridge by vacuum. Eluent was evapo- rated to dryness in a gentle stream of nitrogen and re-suspended in  1.0 mL of MeOH. The samples were prepared in triplicate. The method selectivity  was determined by comparing the chromatograms of the extract and  standard azadirachtin, and the identifi cation was achieved by comparing  the retention time of the peaks. The optimal conditions consisted of  an isocratic solvent system containing 40% acetonitrile in water, employ- ing a reverse-phase analytical C18 column (Phenomenex-Luna II; 150 ×  4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm) equipped with a precolumn (Phenomenex; 4 × 3 mm,  5 μm), at a fl ow-rate of 0.4 mL/min and an injector fi tted with a  20 μL loop. Limit of detection The limit of detection (LOD) was defi ned as the concentration in which  the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) was equal to 3 : 1, which was obtained by  injection/measurement of the S/N ratio. The LOD was 25 ng/mL for  azadirachtin. HPLC and MS parameters All analyses were carried out using an Alliance 2795 HPLC (Waters,  Manchester, UK) coupled with a Quattro Premier T-Wave mass spectrom- eter. A reverse-phase analytical C18 column (Phenomenex-Luna II; 150 ×  Chemical Characterization of Azadirachta Indica Phytochem.

The mobile phase consisted of an isocratic mixture of  water–acetonitrile (60 : 40) at a fl ow-rate of 0.4 mL/min and an injector  fi tted with a 20 μL loop. To deliver the samples into the mass spectrom- eter, a splitter was used at a rate of 2 : 1 (waste : MS). Samples were ionized  using an electrospray (ES) ion source operating in negative mode. The  temperatures of the block source and probe were set at 135 and 300°C,  respectively. Optimization of the fl ow-rates of drying gases as well as the  three main ionization parameters (capillary, cone, and extractor voltages)  were performed using direct infusion into the ES source. The nebulizer  and desolvation gas fl ows (nitrogen) were 51 and 350 L/h, respectively.  The capillary was then set at 2.94 kV for all experiments. For selected  reaction monitoring mode (SRM) experiments two transitions were  selected m/z 719 → 486 and 719 → 211 (monitoring), using 39 V at the  cone and collision energy of 20 eV. The dwell time was 0.06 s. The colli- sion gas pressure (argon) was set at 5.70 e−3 mbar for all experiments. All  MS data were acquired and processed using MassLynx NT 4.0 software  (Waters, Cheshire, UK). Sample preparation for meliatoxins detection Matured fruits of M. azedarach, A. indica and grafts of both were collected  at the experimental campus of Agronomic Institute of Paraná, Xambrê-PR,  Brazil, in May, 2008. Intact matured fruits of M. azedarach (50 g), A. indica  (20 g) and of a graft (20 g) were dried in an air-oven at 60°C for 24 h and  were separately ground. All samples were mixed separately with metha- nol in centrifuge tubes by vortex agitation (Phoenix AP56, Araraquara, SP  Brazil) for 30 s at the maximum possible speed, and then centrifuged at  10000 rpm at 20°C for 20 min (Joan B4i/BR41, St-Herblain, France). The  supernatants were transferred into the sample vial. The precipitate was  transferred into centrifuge tubes and was extracted twice as above and  the supernatants were transferred into the same sample vial. The samples  were evaporated in a speed-vac aff ording the concentrated extracts.  The methanol extracts were partitioned into hexane-, ethyl acetate- and  hydro-alcoholic-soluble fractions. The samples were prepared in tripli- cate. Ethyl acetate-soluble fractions containing meliatoxins were then  analysed by MALDI-Na+. Direct extract analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) MALDI data were recorded on a ThermoFinnigan (San Jose, CA, USA) LTQ  with vMALDI source. The vMALDI has a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm) with  a 20 Hz repetition rate, maximum output of 250 μJ/pulse (at 100% laser  power) and ∼100 μm spot size. Positive ion mode spectra were collected  with a laser power of 18% (most of the time), automatic gain control  (AGC, which determines the optimum number of laser shots needed per  scan for adequate signals) and one microscan per spectrum. The samples  were dissolved in MeOH : H2O (7 : 3), aff ording solutions of 1 ppm. A 1 μL  aliquot of each sample was spotted on a stainless steel MALDI plate, and  (before that solvent was allowed to dry) 1 μL of DHB was spotted on top  [DHB (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) = 40 mg/mL, in 70 : 30 MeOH : H2O, with  20 mmol of sodium acetate added]. For MS/MS, the collision-induced  dissociation (CID) required for a given parent ion was 40 and the isolation  width was 2; the laser power was 18% (most of the time), with automatic  gain control and one microscan per spectrum. Results and Discussion In order to obtain rootstocks of Meliaceae adapted to cool  climates, M. azedarach was selected for vegetative propagation  of A. indica. Both genera share a number of interesting anatomi- cal characters not recorded elsewhere in the Meliaceae, in par- ticular the clusters of minute vessels with spiral thickening of the  walls (Pennington and Styles, 1975). In addition, M. azedarach  trees have a better potential to survive low temperatures than  A. indica. The experiment was conducted in 1998 at the Agronomic  Institute of Paraná, Londrina, PR/Brazil. The experimental design  used was cleft grafting, with a graft of the terminal part of the  branches of A. indica. The grafted trees were smaller-sized, more  highly branched and fruited in the fi rst year. About 150 of these  bench grafts have been successfully planted in the experimental  campus of the Agronomic Institute of Paraná, Xambrê-PR, Brazil.  The trees are producing excellent fruits. In this paper we describe an investigation conducted on the  extracts from stem, leaves and root of a graft of A. indica on M.  azedarach rootstock searching for limonoids. Fractions were  monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and only those that showed  features of limonoids were examined. A dichloromethane-soluble fraction of the methanol extract  from the stem aff orded the limonoids 28-deoxonimbolide (3),  salannin (2) and 6-O-acetylnimbandiol (4). Limonoid 3 was previ- ously found in leaves, 2 in seeds, and 2 and 4 in oil from seeds of  A. indica (Kigodi et al., 1989; Akhila and Rani, 1999), but not in the  stem of this species. Salannin (2) was also found in the root of  M. azedarach (Srivastava and Gupta, 1985). Thus, the fi nding of 2  in this study suggests that it could have been translocated from  the M. azedarach rootstock to the A. indica graft, and it might be  the biosynthetic intermediate to 3 and 4 (Scheme 1). The synthe- sis of the two latter compounds may be directly related to the  graft. However, it is clear that a great deal of work is needed to  establish whether metabolites formed de novo have a signifi cant  role in the biochemical adaptation of plant growing on a second  one, such as for instance M. azedarach rootstock. The hexane and dichloromethane extracts from leaves were  combined and after successive chromatographic separations  aff orded the limonoid nimbolide (5) and predominantly a mix- ture of limonoids isolated previously from leaves of A. indica,  which were not separated. The dichloromethane-soluble  fraction of methanol extract from leaves gave the limonoids,  3, 6-deacetylnimbinene (6) and 6-deacetylnimbin (7). The  ethylacetate-soluble fraction of this methanol extract aff orded  the fl avonoids quercetin and quercitrin (Ternai and Markham,  1976; Agrawal, 1989). All limonoids isolated were previously  found from the leaves of A. indica (Akhila and Rani, 1999);  however, 6-deacetylnimbin (7) was reported from terminal  shoots, which included leaves (Akhila and Rani, 1999). Quercetin  and quercitrin were not previously found in the A. indica leaves;  however, they are of widespread distribution and thus possibly of  little interest to clarify the secondary metabolites translocation. The 1H NMR spectra of the hexane, dichloromethane and  methanol extracts from the roots showed that the most of  the limonoides were in the CH2Cl2 fraction. This extract, after  successive chromatographic separations, aff orded 21 fractions,  whose 1H and 13C NMR spectra showed signals corresponding to  limonoids isolated previously from the root of M. azedarach. Only  the major limonoid nimbolin A (8; Huang et al., 1996) was iso- lated as pure compound. The advantage of the graft of A. indica on M. azedarach is that  it is suitable for use in cool climates. An analysis of grafted A.  indica is very important as quality control, since the primary inter- est is its insecticide activity. Thus, to determine the graft eff ects  on the biosynthesis of azadirachtin in all aerial parts of the  grafted tree, these were investigated by LC-MS. An additional  criterion used to select the developmental stage of fruits was the  characteristic color as it changed during development; immature  (small and green), juvenile (<2 cm long and greenish), matured  (almost 2 cm long and greenish yellow) and fully matured fruits  M.

The standard used in this study was purifi ed as described  in the Experimental section, and identifi ed on the basis of spec- tral data, particularly 1H and 13C NMR, HSQC, HMBC, ESI-MSMS  and by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those from the  literature (Kraus et al., 1997). A standard sample was prepared  and injected to the HPLC system (optimal conditions, experimen- tal section) and the chromatogram (Fig. 1) showed that azadi- rachtin is pure and can be used as standard. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used to develop  a rapid and sensitive method for detecting azadirachtin on all  aerial parts of this graft. Investigations were therefore initially  focused on fi nding the best extraction and method for azadi- rachtin separation, which was rather diffi  cult, since there is often  a complex mixture of related compounds of similar polarity.  The best results were obtained using extraction with MeOH  by centrifugation and cleanup by cyanopropyl SPE cartridge.  Subsequently, the residue containing azadirachtin was re- dissolved in methanol and analysed by HPLC with tandem  MS-MS. Thus, the mobile phase was determined for reverse mode  after testing diff erent compositions of solvents. The best results  were obtained using H2O : acetonitrile (6 : 4). This mobile phase  provided excellent separation between azadirachtin and related  compounds, and good ionization levels under the ES source. The  SRM (selected reaction monitoring mode) transitions were  chosen on the basis of the stability of the ion products obtained  under collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS/MS and also on  the basis of interfering compounds from matrixes (ripe seed  Figure 3. Selected reaction monitoring mode chromatograms obtained for analyses of azadirachtin in: stem without bark (G), stem bark (H), leaves  (I) and fl owers (J) of the graft of A. indica on M. azedarach rootstock. kernels, etc.). The second-generation product ion spectrum of  azadirachtin showed a deprotonated molecule ([M − H−]) at m/z  719. The ion products chosen, m/z 719 → 486 and m/z 719 →  211 (Fig. 1), to perform the transitions in SRM mode during the  development and application of this method provided an excel- lent specifi city to the method, as shown by the SRM chromato- grams in Figs 2 and 3. Inspecting Figs 2 and 3 clearly shows that azadirchtin was  detected in all aerial parts except in leaves (I). The content of  azadirachtin in all aerial parts was not determined by this method.  The concentration of the extracts analysed were not very diff er- ent, ranging from 17.5 to 22.0 mg/mL, the lowest being 13.0 mg/ mL of seed coat (F). Furthermore, 20 μL samples were injected  into the analytical column in all analyses, suggesting that the  amount of azadirachtin in these extracts can be inferred from the  peak area obtained in the SRM chromatograms. SRM chromatograms (Fig. 2) indicated that azadirachtin was  in high concentration in the samples of dry fully matured  seed kernels (E). As expected, azadirachtin was nearly in  equal proportion in fresh juvenile (B), matured (C) and fully  matured seed kernels (D) (Fig. 2). Azadirachtin was present in a  smaller proportion in intact fresh immature fruits (A); in general  the content of azadirachtin increased with the growth of the  fruit (Martinez, 2002). Dry fully matured seed kernels (E)  contained ca. 5 (peak area E/B, 32344/6195) to 70 (peak area  E/A, 32344/459) times more azadirachtin than fresh fruits  (A–D). The analysis of the dry stem without bark (G) indicated a  notable concentration of azadirachtin, but it appeared with  M. R.

Anal. 2010, 21, 363–373 370 a signifi cant decrease in the dry stem bark (H) and fl owers (J,  Fig. 3). Sundaram (1996) detected azadirachtin from samples of Neem  seed kernels, leaves, bark, roots and stem, obtained from  Kanthayapalayam, South India. The extracts were subjected  to column cleanup and azadirachtin concentration was quanti- fi ed using a HPLC method. The data in diff erent parts indicated  that the seed kernels contained ca. 40 (in leaves) to 166 (in  stem) times more azadirachtin than the other plant parts. The  concentration decreased in the order of seed kernels >>> leaves  > bark > roots > stem. However, this was not observed in our  study; the analysis of dry stem without bark (G) indicated a  notable concentration of azadirachtin (seed kernels E ca. 19 times  more than stem G, peak area E/G, 32344/1702; but stem G ca. 6  times more than bark H 1702/291) and was not found in leaves  (I). Several procedures have been published for the isolation of  azadirachtin (Schroeder and Nakanishi, 1987; Sundaram, 1996).  Purifi cation was accomplished by successive partitioning and a  variety of chromatographic steps including preparative layer  chromatography, open-column, reversed-phase chromatogra- phy and HPLC. In spite of these reports, any isolation procedure  provides the large amount of pure azadirachtin from Neem stem.  In this work, in order to assess an effi  cient extraction in a shorter  time, a method of extraction using methanol and centrifugation  (at the maximum possible) to disrupt cell structure was devel- oped and azadirachtin was obtained in comparable quantities in  seeds kernels and stem. Centrifugation also resulted in a more  effi  cient methanolic extraction in the seed coat and stem bark.  The presence of azadirachtin in the seed coat does not appear to  have been previously recorded. The new isolation procedure,  once optimized, will aff ord a highly attractive method to obtain  a large scale azadirachtin. Figure 4.

(D) Performance of MALDI-MS matrices DHB (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid). The limit of detection of azadirachtin was 25 ng/mL; thus, the  extraction and HPLC-MS/MS method used in this study should  have revealed azadirachtin in leaves if it had been present. Neem  trees begin their reproductive stage at about 3–5 years of age,  but the maximum production of fruits does not occur until they  are 10 years old. An adult Neem tree produces about 20 g of  pesticidal compounds in a season (Schmutterer, 1990). The graft  of A. indica on M. azedarach analysed was 8 years old; it was pro- bably not adult enough to biosynthesize azadirachtin in leaves.  However, the absence of azadirachtin in leaves could be attrib- uted to the infl uence of the graft on the biosyntheses of this  limonoid in this organ. MALDI-MS has a number of advantages, including speed of  analysis, high sensitivity, wide applicability combined with a  good tolerance toward contaminants and the ability to analyse  complex mixtures (Karas, 1996). Therefore, the ethanol extracts  of the seeds of M. azedarach, A. indica and the graft of A. indica  on M. azedarach were partitioned into hexane-, ethyl acetate-  and hydro-alcoholic-soluble fractions. The samples were pre- pared in triplicate. Ethyl acetate-soluble fractions containing  meliatoxins were then analysed by MALDI-MS after the addition  of sodium acetate. DHB (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) was found  to be a good matrix for analysing meliatoxins. No interference  from the DHB matrix was observed; the matrix peaks are all at  masses less than 273 (Fig. 4). Simple examination of the MALDI  mass spectrum for ethyl acetate-soluble fractions from seeds of  M. azedarach, recorded in the presence of Na+ cations, yielded  unambiguously the molecular weight for both meliatoxin types  A1/B1 [658 + Na = 681]+ and A2/B2 [644 + Na = 667]+ (Fig. 4). The  fragmentation pattern shown in Fig. 5 corresponds to meliatox- ins A1/B1 or A2/B2 (m/z 557). As summarized in Fig. 5, two of the  ions detected in the MALDI-MS spectrum (m/z 579 and 557) were  Chemical Characterization of Azadirachta Indica Phytochem.

Suggested fragmentation pathways for meliatoxins A1, A2, B1 and B2. assigned to meliatoxins A1/B1 or A2/B2 and, therefore, they were  candidates for MS/MS experiments. The MALDI MS/MS spectrum  of these selected parent peaks showed only one signifi cant frag- ment ion peak, and meliatoxins were the only possible explana- tion for m/z 579 (Figs. 5–7). Simple MALDI-MS instruments cannot tell the diff erence  between isomers which have identical mass, such as meliatoxins  A1 (MW = 658.73) and B1 (MW = 658.73), as well as A2 (MW =  664.71) and B2 (MW = 664.71). However, the analysis of the crude  extract of M. azedarach by MALDI-MS-Na+ shows spectacular  reproducibility and fragmentations as real fi ngerprints of the  meliatoxins A1/B1 and A2/B2. Since the objective of this research  was to verify the absence of meliatoxins in seeds of the graft of  A. indica on M. azedarach and not identify each compound, three  ethyl acetate-soluble fractions of fruits ethanol extract from  A. indica and from the graft were analysed by MALDI-MS-Na+. The  MALDI-Na+ mass spectra yielded unambiguously only the molec- ular weight of azadirachtin m/z 743 [720 + 23]+, confi rming the  absence of meliatoxins in the seeds from A. indica and from graft  (Fig. 4). However, the ions for meliatoxins A1/B1 and A2/B2 (m/z 681  and 667, respectively) could have a low intensity. To resolve this  uncertainty, these ions were selected for MS/MS experiments. As  a result, the peak that represents putatively meliatoxins m/z 579  was absent (Figs. 6 and 7). Finally, this study showed that A. indica grafted onto M.  azedarach rootstock produces azadirachtin, and also that its fruits  are free of meliatoxins from the rootstock, confi rming that this  graft forms an excellent basis for breeding vigorous Neem trees  in cooler regions. These results suggest that the program of the  Agronomic Institute of Paraná (Brazil) will provide useful Neem  trees to be used in the integrated pest management system in  southern regions of Brazil.
