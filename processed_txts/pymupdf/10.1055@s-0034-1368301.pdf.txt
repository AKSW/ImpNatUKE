Introduction ! An estimated 48610 new cases of leukemia and 23720 deaths due to it were expected to occur in the US in 2013 [1]. Leukemia is a broad term cov- ering a variety of diseases. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The prognosis of APL has been considerably en- hanced by the use of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). The use of these drugs is, however, narrowed by resistance to ATRA and the side effects of ATO [2], motivating the explo- ration for compounds bearing new mechanisms of action. In our search to find endophytes in medicinal As- teraceae as potential new anticancer secondary metabolite producers, we have isolated several endophytic fungi from Yacon tissues. Among them, Papulaspora immersa H.H. Hoston (Chaeto- miaceae) and Nigrospora sphaerica (Sacc.) E.W. Mason (Trichosphaeriaceae) yielded the natural products (22E,24R)-8,14-epoxyergosta-4,22-di- ene-3,6-dione (a) and aphidicolin (b), respective- ly (l " Fig. 1). These agents exhibit cytotoxic activ- ities against some human tumor cells, including HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (IC50 values of 1.65 µM and 0.27 µM, correspondingly) [3,4]. Aphidicolin is an antibiotic and cytotoxic diter- pene first isolated from cultures of the fungus Cephalosporium aphidicola Petch (Hypocreaceae). This agent prevents DNA synthesis by inhibition of DNA polymerase α and δ [5], binding reversibly to the enzymes and not to DNA, and is selectively toxic in the S-phase of the cell cycle [6]. Schimke and coworkers demonstrated that the mode of ac- tion of (b) on HeLaS3 cells depends on the con- centration and duration of exposure, ranging from complete apoptosis in the early S-phase to inhibition of progression through the S-phase to different degrees, with cells eventually under- going mitosis with the extensive generation of microcells. They also observed that some cells “escaped” the early S-phase apoptotic position, Abstract ! As a result of a program to find antitumor com- pounds of endophytes from medicinal Asteraceae, the steroid (22E,24R)-8,14-epoxyergosta-4,22-di- ene-3,6-dione (a) and the diterpene aphidicolin (b) were isolated from the filamentous fungi Pa- pulaspora immersa and Nigrospora sphaerica, re- spectively, and exhibited strong cytotoxicity against HL-60 cells. A proteomic approach was used in an attempt to identify the drugsʼ molecu- lar targets and their respective antiproliferative mode of action. Results suggested that the (a) growth inhibition effect occurs by G2/M cell cycle arrest via reduction of tubulin alpha and beta iso- mers and 14–3–3 protein gamma expression, fol- lowed by a decrease of apoptotic and inflamma- tory proteins, culminating in mitochondrial oxi- dative damage that triggered autophagy-associ- ated cell death. Moreover, the decrease observed in the expression levels of several types of histo- nes indicated that (a) might be disarming onco- genic pathways via direct modulation of the epi- genetic machinery. Effects on cell cycle progres- sion and induction of apoptosis caused by (b) were confirmed. In addition, protein expression profiles also revealed that aphidicolin is able to influence microtubule dynamics, modulate pro- teasome activator complex expression, and con- trol the inflammatory cascade through overex- pression of thymosin beta 4, RhoGDI2, and 14–3– 3 proteins. Transmission electron micrographs of (b)-treated cells unveiled dose-dependent mor- phological characteristics of autophagy- or onco- sis-like cell death.

The study of HL-60 cells shows that (b) increases the phosphorylation of histone H2AX in the early S-phase, inducing DNA damage [8]. Activation of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) was also detected [9], perhaps ex- plaining the synergistic effect that (b) exhibits in the combined treatment of HL-60 cells with ATRA [10]. Epoxyergostane-type steroids have exhibited cytotoxicity against a variety of tumor cell lines. For example, 2 µM stoloniferones from the soft coral Clavularia (Clavularidae) cause 69% of the growth inhibition of P-388 leukemia cells [11]; withaferin A, present in some genera of Solanaceae, displays IC50 values in the range of 0.5 to 2.2 µM against several cancer cell lines [12]. Steroid-based regimens are frequently used to treat APL patients affected with retinoic acid syndrome, a serious complication de- rived from the treatment with ATRA. Dexamethasone (DEX), one of the most used synthetic glucocorticoids (GC) to treat that problem, also displays an antiproliferative effect itself [13], and bears structural resemblance with human GCs. In general, the ef- fect of GCs on lymphoid cells includes G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [14]. GCs mediate many of their anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects through the inhibition of NF-ĸB [15]. Laane et al. showed that DEX-induced cell death involves autophagy triggered by dephosphorylation of Akt preceding the manifesta- tion of a massive mitochondria-dependent apoptosis [16]. Sama- di et al. described the antiproliferative action of withaferin A through G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, also a result of Akt deactivation [12]. The present investigation was undertaken in an attempt to eluci- date the actual mechanism behind the induction of HL-60 cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity by compounds (a) and (b) us- ing a proteomic approach. Results ! Taking into account what is known regarding the cytotoxicity of fungal secondary metabolites [3,4], the HL-60 promyelocytic leu- kemia cell line was chosen. The cells were treated with (a) and (b), and the proteomes of drug-treated and control cells were de- termined to find the proteins with altered levels. It was hoped that an analysis would aid in finding the drugsʼ antiproliferative modes of action. After 48 h of treatment, cells were harvested, counted, and the cell growth inhibitory activity was determined (l " Table 1), cor- roborating the earlier observed cytotoxic outcomes. Subse- quently, cellular proteins were extracted using two different but consecutive lysis buffers, a modified RIPA (radio immunoprecipi- tation assay) buffer, and a urea-based buffer. Aliquots of the ex- tracts containing 100 µg of protein were denatured, reduced, al- kylated, digested, and labeled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) 8-plex reagents. Samples were submitted to strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography us- ing a salt gradient elution, and fractions were subsequently frac- tionated by nanoHPLC. MALDI/TOF‑MS/MS analysis of the LC-fractionated iTRAQ-la- beled peptides from the RIPA- and urea-based buffersʼ lysates of (b)-treated cells (l " Tables 2 and 3, respectively) revealed that cells treated with 0.4 µM (b) exhibited significant elevated levels of several proteins like POTEF, transgelin-2, tubulin α, stathmin (STAT), and RhoGDI2, among others. Lowered levels of histones H2A type 1 and H1.4, and the proteasome activator complex sub- unit 1 were also observed. Cells treated with 2.66 µM (b) showed a similar protein profile except that tubulin α, cofilin-1, and 14– 3–3 proteins were present at control levels. MS/MS analyses of fractions derived from cells treated with 1.65 µM (a) displayed significant lowered levels of all the proteins detected in the RIPA lysates (l " Table 2), as well some members of the 14–3–3 protein family and hnRNP A2/B1 from urea lysates (l " Table 3). Notably, the majority of proteins detected from cells treated with a higher concentration (4.95 µM) of (a) exhibited protein levels equivalent to the untreated cells, except for the lev- els of RhoGDI2, SET, TB4, MIF, and some 14–3–3 protein isomers that were lowered. Cell cycle progression and cell death were examined with flow cytometric analyses. HL-60 cells treated with 0.4 µM (b) showed significant arrest in the S-phase (l " Table 4), and cells underwent apoptosis, which was markedly increased in 2.66 µM (b)-treated cells Cells treated with 1.65 µM (a) showed a moderate G2/M-phase arrest, which increased significantly in cells treated with 4.95 µM (a), but no apoptosis was observed (l " Table 4). In order to ascertain how (a)-treated cells died, and to correlate death with the changes in protein levels, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analyses were per- formed. Representative SEM micrographs of untreated and (a)- treated HL-60 cells are shown in l " Fig. 2. Untreated cells exhib- ited a rounded and smooth surface (l " Fig. 2C) while cells treated with 1.65 µM (a) had a moderate reduction in size accompanied by a lumpy and blebbing membrane (l " Fig. 2A). Cells treated with 4.95 µM (a) showed a complex surface morphology with a combination of a coarse membrane presenting scale-like ultra- structures, a smooth surface with numerous folds (l " Fig. 2B), and some microvilli or accentuated blebs. TEM micrographs of untreated cells (l " Fig. 3C) showed a few enlarged rough endo- plasmic reticula (ER); mitochondria (MT) were either elongated or rounded with simple tubular cristae; vacuolar and granular Table 1 Growth inhibition of HL-60 cells caused by (22E,24R)-8,14-epoxyer- gosta-4,22-diene-3,6-dione (a) and aphidicolin (b).

Cells treated with 1.65 µM (a) displayed marked swelling of MT with vacuolization, disintegrated cristae, de- creased matrix density, and, eventually, rupture of the mem- brane (l " Fig. 3A); increases in peroxisome and dilated ER num- bers were observed. Also, ER invagination and engulfing of cyto- plasmic organelles occurred, initiating the formation of autopha- gic vacuoles (AV) as suggested by Dunn jr. [17].

SEM analysis of cells treated with 0.4 µM (b) exhibited surfaces with extensive microvilli or blebbing and formation of apoptotic bodies (AB; l " Fig. 2D). TEM analysis exhibited clumping of chro- matin along the nuclear membrane, formation of AB containing intact organelles, and AV surrounded by curled membranes (l " Fig. 3D). At a higher concentration of (b) (2.66 µM), SEM showed just a few cells possessing either a cracked (l " Fig. 2E) or a completely disrupted cytoplasmic membrane, which was con- firmed by TEM analysis that displayed cells with a ruptured plas- ma membrane, an uneven electron-lucent nucleus (l " Fig. 3E1), and a plethora of AV (l " Fig. 3E2), all indicating a necrosis-like cell Fig. 2 Scanning electron micrographs of HL-60 cells.

To further validate the level of differentially expressed proteins, Western blotting analyses were carried out (l " Fig. 4). The over- expression of STAT and TB4 by (b)-treated cells was confirmed as well as the hypo-expression of tubulin by (a)-treated cells. Discussion ! With respect to the mode of action of (b), an apoptotic profile was confirmed by SEM and TEM micrographs and seems to be orchestrated by the increased levels of POTEF (a protein reported to function as a proapoptotic factor [19]), hnRNP A2/B, and RhoG- DI2. Higher levels of RhoGDI2 ultimately sensitize HL-60 cells to caspase-3-mediated apoptosis [20], and elicit an autoimmune re- sponse in acute leukemia [21]. RhoGDI2, along with hnRNP A2/ B1, are among the ten most frequently observed human proteins in proteome analyses of apoptotic cells [22]. The Rho family of GTPases plays an important role in cell morphology, cell cycle, and programmed cell death progression, controlling actin cytos- keleton rearrangement, blebbing, fragmentation, and phagocyto- sis of apoptotic cells [23]. Moreover, lowered levels of hnRNP A2/ B1, SET, and RhoGDI2 indicate chemoresistance in ovarian tumor tissues treated with paclitaxel, a microtubule stabilizer and apo- ptosis-inducing drug [24]. Microtubules are formed by alpha and beta tubulin heterodimers that have a short half-life, so they are in constant assembly or disassembly, a dynamic instability con- trolled by STAT, which promotes depolymerization of microtu- bules and/or prevents polymerization of tubulin heterodimers. Overexpression of STAT in mitotic cells induces a misaligned dis- tribution of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, impairing the formation of a functional mitotic spindle [25]. The aberrant chro- mosome segregation and cell division observed by Schimke et al. [7] in HeLaS3 cells treated with (b) might be a consequence from defects in assembly and a function of the mitotic spindle caused by STAT overload, which also activates the intrinsic apoptosis pathway [26]. The hypo-expression of histones H2A and H1.4 observed in cells treated with (b) corroborates the results of Kurose et al. [8], sug- gesting that DNA damage and cell growth arrest caused by (b) in- volve those proteins that may be downregulated by the increased level of SET, a multitasking protein subunit of the INHAT complex (inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases) [27]. It is known that H1.2 inhibition causes defects in the chromatin structure and changes in the expression of specific genes linked to the cell cycle [28]. The observed decreased level of proteasome activator com- plex subunit 1, which is involved in DNA damage response and the S-phase of mitotic cell cycle arrest, might also play an addi- tional role in this process. Increased levels of cofilin-1 and trans- gelin-2, proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization [29,30], reinforce the hypothesis that the tumor suppressor activity of (b) might occur by actin destabilization. In relation to the mode of action of compound (a), the observed downregulation of 14–3–3 proteins could influence the G2/M transition of the mitotic cells cycle, thereby directing the cell to die by means other than apoptosis. It is well known that a reduc- tion in 14–3–3 proteins accelerates cell death and enhances sen- sitivity to DNA damage-inducing drugs [31]. In addition, dimin- ished levels of MIF, a proinflammatory cytokine capable of mod- ulating the expression of the tumor suppressor TP53 (a.k.a. p53), ultimately causing tumor growth and invasiveness, might be adding some effect in the cell cycle regulation and consequent in- hibition of cell growth. MIF is overexpressed in several types of cancer and its blocking has been proposed as a strategy in the control of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [32]. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) has also been detected at high levels in a number of leuke- mia types. Promyelocytes and promyelomonocytes produce MPO during inflammation and under oxidative stress conditions [33]. High levels of MPO can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are considered the lynchpin in leukemia relapse and drug re- sistance [34,35]. The observed decrease in MPO and MIF indi- cates an apparent anti-inflammatory/antioxidant action of (a). It is interesting to note that anti-MIF immunoglobulin and nonster- oidal, anti-inflammatory drugs are employed in conjunction with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of some types of cancer [36]. Thymosin β4 (TB4) operates in cytoskeleton reorganization, se- questering gamma actin and impairing its polymerization, which consequently plays a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and scavenging of ROS, indirectly protecting cells from oxidative damage. Decreased levels of TB4 induce significant in- creases of ROS and disruption of the mitochondrial morphology in human colorectal carcinoma cells [37]. Quite the opposite, in- creased levels of TB4 promote stabilization of the transcription factor HIF-1, whose expression is activated under hypoxia, a phe- nomenon that occurs during cancer progression, which eventu- ally increases the production of vascular endothelial growth fac- tor with consequent angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. In turn, it was proposed that Rho GTPases might be upstream regulators of TB4 [38,39], a fact that corroborates the direct correlation ob- served between TB4/RhoGDI2 expressed levels either in (a)- or (b)-treated cells (l " Table 3). TB4 was also shown to downregulate inflammatory mediators like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and to increase production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [40]. Materials and Methods ! Compoundsʼ origin (22E,24R)-8,14-Epoxyergosta-4,22-diene-3,6-dione (a) was iso- lated from P. immersa and aphidicolin (b) from N. sphaerica as previously described [3,4]. Both are endophytic fungi from the plant Smallanthus sonchifolius (Yacon), Asteraceae. The purity of compounds (a) and (b) was assessed by GC and HPLC analyses as 98 and 99%, respectively.

Cell culture and preparation of lysates HL 60 (ATCC CCL-240) cells were cultured in 5 × 250 mL Falcon tissue culture flasks containing 40 mL of RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO/Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (triple 0.1 µm sterile-filtered, Gemini Bio-Products) and 1% of 100 u penicillin/ streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmo- sphere in a humidified incubator. After 10 days of culture, cells grew to a density of 1.4 × 106 cells per flask and were treated with the test substances for an additional 48 h using 0.7 µg/mL (1.65 µM) and 2.1 µg/mL (4.95 µM) of (a), and 0.15 µg/mL (0.4 µM) and 0.9 µg/mL (2.66 µM) of (b). A flask containing cells treated with 0.1% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a vehicle control. In order to obtain the lysates, the medium of each culture flask was transferred to a 50-mL conical Falcon tube and centri- fuged at 4°C/10 min/1200 rpm. The supernatants were decanted and cell pellets were washed 3 × 10 mL with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4 (without Ca or Mg; Lonza), followed by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1.5 mL of modified RIPA lysis buffer by pi- petting up and down. The viscous content was ice incubated for 10 min, sonicated for 5 min, boiled for 5 min inside a beaker con- taining water, and extensively disrupted with 25 gauge needles. The resultant material was centrifuged at 4°C/30 min/12000 g. The obtained supernatants were collected, labeled “RIPA lysates”, and the total protein content was quantified with the BCA pro- tein assay according to the manufacturerʼs instructions (Thermo Scientific) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. The residual pellets were submitted to a second lysis process us- ing 1.5 mL of urea/thiourea lysis buffer [5 M urea (EMD Chemi- cals, Inc.), 2 M thiourea (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mM DTT (Fisher Sci- entific), 0.1% SDS (Bio-Rad Labs), PBS, pH 7.4] and incubated for 30 min at r.t. followed by centrifugation at 15°C/30 min/ 20000 g. The obtained supernatants were collected, named “urea lysates”, and the total protein content was quantified by the Pierce 660 nm protein assay (Thermo Scientific) using BSA as the standard [41]. Growth inhibition Growth inhibition (GI) was assessed by the trypan blue dye ex- clusion method. For each tested compound, the GI was based on the concept of test through control (T/C), and the following equa- tion was used: GI = 100 – (T/C × 100) based on Richter et al. [42]. Control groups were treated with vehicle and doxorubicin (Dox- olem, Zodiac Produtos Farmacêuticos S/A, purity > 95%), the lat- ter of which was used as a positive control (IC50 0.02 µg/ mL = 0.4 nM). Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (ITRAQ) labeling and strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography Before being submitted to the isobaric labeling, the urea lysates had to be cleaned in order to remove excess urea to avoid modi- fications of proteins at temperatures above 37°C, rendering a protein unsuitable for enzymatic digestion [43]. Zeba desalting spin columns (Thermo Scientific) were previously conditioned with 4 × 1 mL PBS, pH 7.4, and centrifuged for 2 min/r.t./ 1200 rpm. An aliquot of lysate corresponding to 100 µg of protein was speed-vacuum dried and resuspended in 1000 µL of PBS, pH 7.4. The obtained solution was split into five separate 200 µL aliquots in 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes, followed by dilution of each to 700 µL with PBS, pH 7.4. Each of these was loaded into separate Zeba columns. After complete sample absorption, the tubes were centrifuged for 2 min/4°C/1200 rpm and the collected liquid was dried. The five samples were recombined by pipetting up and down 20 µL of dissolution buffer in the first tube, followed by vor- texing, spinning, and transfer to the second tube; the procedure was repeated until the fifth tube. Urea or RIPA lysates were reduced, alkylated, digested, and la- beled essentially as recommended by the iTRAQ 8-plex reagents manufacturerʼs protocol (Applied Biosystems), followed by a cleanup procedure using off-line SCX chromatography, which was carried out using polysulfoethyl A™ macro spin columns 25–150 µL, (PolyLC, Inc.), previously conditioned using 1 × 500 µL MeOH (to activate the stationary phase; centrifuge the tube for 1 min/800 rpm), followed by 2 × 500 µL of 18 mOhm water (to prevent salt precipitation; centrifuge the tube for 1 min/800 rpm), and then 1 × 500 µL of 0.2 M monosodium phos- phate/0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 3.0 (span for 10 s/800 rpm, stood in the tube for 1 h). The stationary phase was equilibrated with 3 × 500 µL 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 3.0, in 20% ACN, then centrifuged for 1 min/800 rpm. Before loading, the sample was completely dried then resuspended in 200 µL of equilibration buffer. After loading, the column was centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 rpm, followed by washing with 2 × 100 µL of equilibration buffer, then centrifuged for 1 min/1000 rpm. Peptides were eluted from the stationary phase using 100 µL of the equilibra- tion buffer solutions containing 40 to 500 mM KCl (Sigma), re- spectively, and centrifuged for 1 min/1000 rpm. After elution, all samples were speed-vacuum dried and reconstituted in 16 µL of 2% ACN (HPLC grade; Mallinckrodt)/0.1% TFA (99+% spectropho- tometric grade; Sigma-Aldrich) in water (HPLC grade; Burdick & Jackson). Samples were stored at − 20°C until LC‑MS analysis. LC‑MS analysis Peptide separation was performed on a Famos/Switchos/Ulti- mate™ chromatography system (Dionex/LC Packings). Individual labeled-SCX aliquots (5 µL) were desalted for 10 min onto a C18 guard column (0.3 × 5 mm, 5 µm, 100 Å, LC Packings) using 2% ACN/0.1% TFA in water at 30 µL/min. Peptides were separated in a Dionex ProteoPep™ C18 column (0.075 × 150 mm; 3 µm particle size, 100 Å) using solvent A (5% ACN/0.1% TFA in water) and sol- vent B (85% ACN/0.1% TFA/5% isopropyl alcohol in water) in a 160-min multistep gradient consisting of 10% solvent B for 40 min, followed by a 20-min linear gradient until 20% B, main- tained for 50 min, increased to 30% B in 20 min and maintained for 50 min, and finally a 10-min linear gradient until 100% B at a flow rate of 0.25 µL/min. The peptide elution was monitored at 214 and 280 nm. The outlet of the UV was coupled with a Probot MALDI-plate spotting device operating with Carrier software v. 1.47 (LC Packings). During separation, a saturated solution of 31.7 mM CHCA (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid; Sigma) in 80% ACN/0.1% TFA in water containing 10 mM ammonium citrate dibasic (Fluka Analytical) and 25 fmol/µL of angiotensin II (AGT II, for internal calibration; Sigma) was continuously added to the eluant by the Probot system at a flow rate of 0.5 µL/min. Samples were spotted every 12.5 s of the LC run onto stainless steel MALDI plates (blank opti-TOF™ LC/MALDI insert 123 × 81 mm, Applied Biosystems) totaling 768 spots (= LC fractions) per sample. Plates were stored in the dark until the MS and MS/MS spectra were ac- quired. For MALDI‑TOF‑MS and -MS/MS analyses, eight mass cal- ibration spots [0.75 µL of a solution containing 1 µL of a six-pro- tein mix (Applied Biosystems) stock solution (1:20) and 24 µL of saturated CHCA solution] were manually pipetted on the 8-pe- rimeter wells of the plate and dried at r.t. MALDI‑TOF‑MS data were acquired automatically over a mass range of 900 to 478 Gallo MBC et al.

MS and MS/MS data acquisition were controlled by 4000 series Explorer v 3.0 software. After plate alignment, external calibration, and in- ternal calibration for each MALDI plate, an MS spectrum was ac- quired for each of the 768 spots. The mass spectra were subjected to an interpretation method, which selected the 10 most intense precursors from each spot excluding ions with an S/N less than 20, filtering out identical peaks detected in adjacent spots with a mass tolerance of 200 ppm, an exclusion list tolerance of 0.1 m/z, and minimum chromatogram peak width of 2 fractions. MS/MS acquisition started from the strongest precursors first. The colli- sion induced dissociation (CID) used a collision cell floated at 2 kV and air as the collision gas; the relative precursor mass window was set at 300 FWHM (full width half mass) with suppression of the precursor ion and metastable ions unfocused; the spectra were acquired for the selected precursors using 3000 shots/spec- trum with 75 shots/sub-spectrum. The stop-condition criterion was determined to the 40 sub-spectra acquisition, passing or fail- ing. The internal one-point calibration utilized m/z of the mono- isotopic molecular ion of AGT II to match the minimum S/N of 200, a mass tolerance of ± 0.5 m/z, a mass error of 5 ppm, and a minimum peak width at 2.9 bins. When the acceptance criteria were not met, a default calibration based on a multi-parameter calibration equation was employed. Proteomics analysis Protein identification and quantitation for the ITRAQ experi- ments were performed with ProteinPilot v. 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems) using the Paragon protein database search algo- rithm. The data analysis parameters were as follows: Sample type: iTRAQ 8-plex (peptide labeled); Cys alkylation: MMTS (methyl methanethiosulfonate); digestion: trypsin; instrument: 4800; special factors: none for RIPA lysates, and urea denatura- tion for urea lysates; ID Focus: biological modifications – searches for over 170 potential modifications. iTRAQ labeled lysine, iTRAQ N-terminal labeling, and MMTS alkylation of cysteine were used as fixed modifications; oxidation of methionine and iTRAQ label- ing of tyrosine were used as variable modifications. Database searching: ipi.HUMAN v.3.61; search effort: thorough ID; mini- mum detected protein threshold [unused ProtScore (conf)]: 99%. The relative quantification was based on the ratio of the re- porter ions corresponding to the urea or RIPA tryptic peptides from treated HL 60 cells over the reporter ion corresponding to the urea or RIPA tryptic peptides from the control. Proteins giving tryptic peptides with an average reporter ion ratio ≥ 2 were clas- sified as upregulated and those with an average reporter ion ratio ≤ 0.9 were classified as downregulated (p ≤ 0.05). Protein ontol- ogy was determined using the UniProtKB/Swiss Prot databank. Cell cycle arrest studies The assay involves the fixation and permeabilization of cells us- ing 70% ethanol, making the staining of DNA within intact cells by propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich) possible. HL-60 cells were grown in 12 × 100 ml petri dishes; each plate contained 10 mL of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% of 100 u penicillin/streptomycin, at 37°C under a 5% CO2 at- mosphere in a humidified incubator. When cells were confluent, they were treated with the vehicle (0.1% DMSO, negative con- trol), 95% S-(+)-camptothecin (10 µM, positive control; Sigma), or test compounds [0.15 and 0.9 µg/mL (b); 0.7 and 2.1 µg/mL (a)] for 48 h. Two independent experiments were carried out. Cel- lular DNA content was quantified by flow cytometric determina- tion of PI intercalated into DNA of intact, fixed cells. Drug- or ve- hicle-treated cells (1 × 106) were collected, twice washed with iced PBS, resuspended in PBS, and fixed with 70% ethanol at − 20°C for 48 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and then treated with 1 mL of PI staining solution [20 µg/mL RNase A (Sig- ma) and 50 µg/mL PI as final concentrations] at 37°C for 30 min in the dark, and cells were stored in the dark at 4°C until analyzed (72 h). DNA content was determined on a BD LSRII special order system flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), equipped with a 488 nm Ar laser, by measuring forward and orthogonal light scatter, and peak and area red fluorescence. Acquisition of data was per- formed by FACSDiva software and analyzed by FlowJo software. Statistical analysis was performed by Studentʼs t-test using a sig- nificance level of p < 0.05. Apoptosis analysis Apoptosis assays were performed according to the manufac- turerʼs protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were cultured similarly to cell cycle analysis. Drug- or vehicle-treated cells (1 × 106) were collected, washed twice with iced PBS, and resuspended in 100 µL annexin-binding buffer (1:10 v/v in 18 mOhm water). Ali- quots of 5 µL of 7-aminoactinomycin D (1:20 v/v in PBS) and an- nexin V-pacific blue conjugate were added, and the sample was incubated at r.t. for 15 min in the dark. An amount of 400 µL an- nexin-binding buffer was added and gently agitated. Samples were maintained on ice until analyzed. The proportion of apo- ptotic cells was determined in a BD FACSAria analyzer (BD Bio- sciences) using a fluorescence excitation at 410 nm and an emis- sion at 455 nm. We considered aphidicolin as the positive control in this experi- ment since it is known to cause apoptosis in HL-60 cells at the tested dosages [8]. Electron microscopy HL-60 cells were cultured and treated in triplicate similarly to the lysates preparation method. Cells were harvested, twice washed with PBS pH 7.4, and then pelleted by low-speed centrifugation. The pellet was fixed with a solution containing 2.5% glutaralde- hyde (Sigma), 2.0% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), 0.1 M sodium ca- codylate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2.5 mM dihydro calcium chloride (Synth) in water for 72 h at 4°C. For scanning electron microsco- py, fixed cells were incubated at 37°C for 90 min on pretreated poly L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) slides. After being rinsed with iced 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, cells were post-fixed 1/1/(v/v) with 2% osmium tetroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in water plus 1.6% potassium ferricyanide (Sigma)-10 mM calcium chloride and 0.2 M sodium cacodylate for 15 min in the dark. After being in contact with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 2 min, the slides were washed three times with the same solution and dehydrated with an aqueous ethanol solution gradient, followed by CO2 critical-point drying using a Leica EM CPD030 apparatus. The specimens mounted on stubs were coated with gold, examined with a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6390LV, JEOL), and photographed. For trans- mission electron microscopy, the cells were fixed and post-fixed similarly to SEM, dehydrated in a graded acetone series, and em- bedded in Poly Bed 812 resin (Polysciences, Inc.). Ultrathin sec- tions were obtained, counterstained with 7% uranium acetate 479 Gallo MBC et al.

Western blotting Proteins were loaded at 20 µg/lane, electrophoresed on 8% SDS- polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% milk in PBS Tween, and immunoblotted with mouse monoclonal anti-TMSB4X (clone 4H7; Abnova), mouse monoclonal anti-STAT1 (clone 1A8; Abnova), mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin (T0198, Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal anti-gamma actin (F-3022, Sigma) at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated over- night at r.t., followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Abcam) or HRP-conju- gated goat anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG (Abcam) secondary anti- bodies at a dilution of 1:25000 for 1 h. The development was car- ried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amer- sham Pharmacia). Acknowledgements !
