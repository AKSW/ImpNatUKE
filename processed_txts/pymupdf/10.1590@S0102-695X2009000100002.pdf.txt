Nesse trabalho foi avaliada a atividade inibitória sobre a enzima  glicossomal gliceraldeído-3-fosfato desidrogenase de T.	 cruzi (gGAPDH) de extratos vegetais  oriundos de plantas das famílias Meliaceae e Rutaceae, na concentração de 100 mg/mL. Foram  testados 46 extratos, dos quais 15 apresentaram atividade inibitória significativa (% AI ≥ 50).  A maioria dos extratos de plantas da família Meliaceae (Cedrela	fissilis, Cipadessa	fruticosa e  Trichilia	ramalhoi) apresentou grande potencial em inibir a atividade enzimática. O fracionamento  do extrato hexânico dos galhos de C.	fruticosa permitiu o isolamento de três flavonóides: flavona,  7-metoxiflavona e 3’,4’,5’,5,7-pentametoxiflavona. Os dois últimos foram ativos na inibição da  atividade de gGAPDH. Desta forma, as três espécies de Meliaceae testadas podem ser consideradas  promissoras na busca de compostos protótipos para o controle da doença de Chagas.

ABSTRACT: The inhibitory activity of crude extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on  glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) enzyme from Trypanosoma	 cruzi	 was evaluated at 100 mg/mL. Forty-six extracts were tested and fifteen of them showed  significant inhibitory activity (IA % ≥ 50). The majority of the assayed extracts of Meliaceae plants  (Cedrela	fissilis, Cipadessa	fruticosa and Trichilia	ramalhoi) showed high ability to inhibit the  enzymatic activity. The fractionation of the hexane extract from branches of C.	fruticosa led to  the isolation of three flavonoids: flavone, 7-methoxyflavone and 3’,4’,5’,5,7-pentamethoxyflavone.  The two last compounds showed high ability to inhibit the gGAPDH activity. Therefore, the  assayed Meliaceae species could be considered as a promising source of lead compounds against  Chagas’ disease.  Keywords: Rutaceae, Meliaceae, flavonoids, gGAPDH, Trypanosoma	cruzi, inhibitors. INTRODUCTION Chagas’ disease, caused by the protozoan  Trypanosoma	cruzi, affects some 16-18 million people,  mostly from South and Central America, where 25 % of  the total population are at risk of contamination (WHO,  2007). Control of the insect vector (Triatoma	infestans)  in endemic areas has led to the virtual elimination  of transmission by insect bites, and as consequence,  blood transfusion and congenital transmission are the  major causes for the spread of the disease (Dias, 1993).  Its treatment is still a challenge, since the only drug  commercially available (benznidazole) has strong side  effects (De Castro, 1993).  The bloodstream form of parasites of the  family Trypanosomatidae possesses a microbody-like  Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 19(1A): Jan./Mar. 2009 2 Ana C. Leite, Alessandra R. P. Ambrozin, Marcelo S. Castilho, et al. organelle, where glycolysis takes place, the glycosome  (Opperdoes & Borst, 1977). The bloodstream form of  the parasite T.	cruzi has no functional tricarboxylic acid  cycle, and it is highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP  production. This great dependence on glycolysis as a  source of energy makes the glycolytic enzymes attractive  targets for trypanocidal drug design (Souza et al., 1998).  Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH)  is a glycolytic enzyme which catalyzes the oxidative  phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP)  to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BGP). The three dimensional  structure of T.	 cruzi gGAPDH previously determined  shows differences, when compared to the homologous  human enzyme that could be exploited for selective  inhibition (Souza et al., 1998).  The need for the development of more efficient  drugs against Chagas’ disease has stimulated us to initiate  a project aiming at the discovery of lead compounds  from several plants of Rutales order. In this way, we  have proposed the utilization of the glycolytic enzyme  gGAPDH as a target for the search of new natural  trypanocides (Tomazela et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001;  Pavão et al., 2002; Moraes et al., 2003). In this paper,  we report the gGAPDH inhibition activity of 46 crude  extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants, along with  three flavones isolated from an active fraction.  MATERIAL AND METHODS Plant material The fruits, branches, stems, roots, and leaves of  Cedrela	fissilis Vell. were collected in 01/06/01 in São  Carlos (São Paulo, Brazil) and identified by Dr. Maria  Inês Salgueiro Lima from the Department of Botany,  Universidade Federal de São Carlos, where a voucher  specimen (6701) was deposited. The fruits, branches  and leaves of Cipadessa	 fruticosa Bl. were collected  in 01/20/01 in Viçosa (Minas Gerais, Brazil) and  identified by Dr. José R. Pirani from the Department of  Botany, Universidade de São Paulo and deposited at the  herbarium from this department with a voucher number  110.664. The branches of Almeidea	coerulea A. St.-Hil.,  stems, and leaves of A.	rubra A. St.-Hil., Conchocarpus	 heterophyllus (A. St.-Hil.) Kallunki & Pirani, Galipea	 carinata Pirani (sp. nov.) and Trichilia	ramalhoi Rizzini  were collected in Southeastern Brazil, and identified  by Dr. José R. Pirani from the Department of Botany,  Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. The specimens  were deposited at the Herbarium of that Department.  The voucher numbers and the dates of collection were  described in Ambrozin et al. (2004). Preparation of crude extracts The powdered air-dried plant material (branches,  fruits, leaves, roots, and/or stems) was extracted by  maceration three times with hexane, at room temperature  for 72 h. This process was repeated with dichloromethane  and methanol for C.	fissilis and C.	fruticosa, and only with  methanol for the other species. The solvent was removed  under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and the  extracts obtained were assayed on T.	 cruzi gGAPDH  enzyme. Isolation of compounds The hexane extract from branches of C.	fruticosa  (12.2 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography  over silica gel using a hexane-dichloromethane-ethyl  acetate-methanol gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction  (6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with  a hexane-dichloromethane-acetone gradient to give 9  fractions. Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using  hexane-dichloromethane-acetone (6:3:1), affording 9  fractions. Fraction 5 was three times chromatographed  through column chromatography on silica gel, eluting  with hexane-dichloromethane-methanol (7:2.5:0.5) to  afford compounds 1 (16.7 mg) and 2 (8.2 mg). Fraction  6 was twice submitted to column chromatography  with  hexane-dichloromethane-methanol  (6:3:1)  giving compound 3 (30.6 mg). Compounds 1-3 were  characterized by comparison of 13C NMR data with the  literature (Kingsburry & Looker, 1975; Passador et al.,  1997) and submitted to the enzymatic assay. Preparation and purification of recombinant T. cruzi  gGAPDH TcGAPDH was overexpressed and purified as  reported by Souza et al. (1998). It is maintained in the  Crystallography Laboratory of the Universidade de São  Paulo, São Carlos, SP, Brazil. T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitory activity gGAPDH activity was determined according  to a previously reported procedure (Barbosa & Nakano,  1987; Vieira et al., 2001). Reduced NADH was  spectrophotometrically measured at 340 nm during 30 s.  The reaction medium contains 50 mmol L-1 Tris-HCl pH  8.6 buffer, 1 mmol L-1 EDTA, 1 mmol L-1 b-mercapto- ethanol, 30 mmol L-1 Na2HAsO4, 2.5 mmol L-1 NAD+,  0.3 mmol L-1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 0.15 mg  protein, in a total volume of 500 mL. The reaction was  initiated by the addition of substrate. The extracts were  tested at a final concentration of 100 mg/mL. RESULTS In this work, we evaluated the inhibitory activity  of 46 extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on T.	cruzi  gGAPDH enzyme (Table 1). Fifteen of them showed high  ability in inhibit the enzyme (IA % > 50) at 100 mg/mL.  Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 19(1A): Jan./Mar. 2009 3 Screening of Trypanosoma	cruzi	glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme inhibitors The hexane extract from branches of C.	fruticosa (CFGH)  and the methanol extracts from Meliaceae plants were the  most active ones, whereas the extracts from Rutaceae did  not present significant results. The  investigation  of  the  ethyl  acetate  fraction (inhibitory activity = 81.9 % at 100 mg/ mL) from the hexane extract from branches of  C.	 fruticosa (CFGH) led to the isolation of three  flavonoids: flavone (1), 7-methoxyflavone (2) and  3’,4’,5’,5,7-pentamethoxyflavone (3). The flavones 1 and  2 were assayed (Table 2) and the results showed that only  2 presented high inhibitory activity against gGAPDH  enzyme.  DISCUSSION The results indicated that, among the assayed  species, C.	 fissilis, C.	 fruticosa and Trichilia	 ramalhoi  are promising sources of lead compounds for the rational  design of new trypanocidal drugs. The inhibitory activity  of the flavones 1 and 2 against gGAPDH has been  reported for the first time. Recently, Ambrozin et al.  (2004) published their activity against trypomastigote  forms of T.	cruzi and Tadesmir et al. (2006) described  the trypanocidal activity of some flavones. A previous  study showed that compound 3 completely inhibited  the gGAPDH activity at 268.8 mmol/L (Tomazela et al.,  2000). Thus, the activity of the studied extract (CFGH)  (Table 1) is probably related to the presence of the active  flavones 2 and 3. However, their enzymatic activity  were considered weak, particularly in comparison with  chalepin, a coumarin isolated from Pilocarpus	spicatus  (Rutaceae), which reduced the gGAPDH activity by 75  % at 93 mmol/L (IC50 = 64 mmol/L) (Vieira et al., 2001;  Pavão et al., 2002; Menezes et al., 2003; Moraes et al.,  2003; Leitão et al., 2004).  Similar studies involving the enzyme gGAPDH  have been reported by our group. Vieira et al. (2001)  showed the enzymatic activity of several plants of  Rutaceae and Meliaceae families and thirteen coumarins  isolated from different species, which are considered as one  of the most promising class of substances with gGAPDH  inhibitory activity. Moreover, the gGAPDH activity of  several flavonoids isolated from Meliaceae, Rutaceae  and Leguminosae plants, including pyrano chalcones,  flavones, flavanones, flavonols and isoflavones, have also  been reported (Tomazela et al., 2000; Moraes et al., 2003).  Recently, Januário et al. (2005) described the activity of  7-hydroxy-4’,6-dimethoxyisoflavone on gGAPDH. All  these data support the hypothesis that highly oxygenated  flavones possess the structural requirements to inhibit  gGAPDH. The family Meliaceae is characterized by the  frequent occurrence of limonoids (da Silva et al., 1984).  This class of compounds has been attracted considerable  interest because of their biological properties and  diversity of structures (Champagne et al., 1992).  Previous studies of C.	 fissilis showed the  isolation of limonoids and triterpenes (Taylor, 1984;  Zelnik, 1966, 1970; Leite et al., 2005a; Ambrozin et  al., 2006) and C.	fruticosa has been reported to contain  ent-clerodanes and labdanes diterpenoids (Rojatkar and  Nagasampagi, 1994; Rojatkar et al., 1994), limonoids,  steroids,  sesquiterpenoids,  heneicosene  derivatives  and one coumarin (Luo et al., 2000, 2001; Leite et al.,  2005a,b). There are no phytochemical studies about T.	 ramalhoi, but several compounds have been isolated  from the Trichilia genus, such as, limonoids (Cortez et  al., 1992; Garcez et al., 1997; Garcez, et al., 2000; Cortez  et al., 2000), lignan glycosides (Cortez et al., 1998),  w-phenyl alkanoic and alkenoic acids (Pupo et al., 1996),  terpenoids, steroids (Pupo et al., 2002; Pupo et al., 1996)  and g-lactones (Pupo et al., 1998). Phytochemical studies  with other active extracts from these plants are in progress  and shall reveal molecules that can be used as potential  lead compounds in the search for potent and selective T.	 cruzi gGAPDH inhibitors. In conclusion, most of the active extracts belong  to the family Meliaceae. New investigations with these  extracts are undertaken in order to find inhibitors that  could act as potential lead molecules on the described  assay. Moreover, the isolated flavonoids bring about the  enzymatic inhibition, showing that these compounds are  potential lead molecules for the development of new  drugs against Chagas’ disease.
