The absolute conﬁguration of the resolved enantiomers was determined by the analysis of optical rotations and CD spectra. The ﬁnding of a ra- cemic mixture instead of an enantiomerically pure metabolite raises questions about the ﬁnal steps in the biosynthesis of this class of natural products, suggesting that the intramolecular chromane ring formation step may not be enzymatically controlled at all in P. obtusifolia.

KEY WORDS: natural products; enantioseparation; circular dichroism; optical rotation; absolute conﬁguration INTRODUCTION The Piperaceae family comprises �3800 species distrib- uted in four genera: Piper L., Peperomia Ruiz and Pavon, Manekia Trel., and Zippelia Blume.1 The Peperomia spe- cies accumulate several bioactive secondary metabolites such as lignans, secolignans, prenylated phenolic com- pounds, and chromanes. Among these, chromanes pos- sess signiﬁcant antiparasitic activity and have been shown to be important chemical markers in this genus.2,3 Despite their well-known bioactivity, there are no reports concern- ing the stereochemistry of these natural products.4,5 In this work, we report for the ﬁrst time the isolation as a ra- cemic mixture of the known bioactive metabolite 3,4-di- hydro-5-hydroxy-2,7-dimethyl-8-(3@-methyl-2@-butenyl)-2-(40- methyl-10,30-pentadienyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (1) from leaves of Peperomia obtusifolia, its resolution using chiral chromatography, and the assignment of its absolute conﬁguration at C-2 in the benzopyran skeleton, by analyzing its optical rotation and circular dichroism (CD) spectra. MATERIALS AND METHODS General Analytical and semipreparative HPLC enantiosepara- tions were performed using stainless-steel Chiralcel OD-H columns (250 mm 3 4.6 mm and 250 mm 3 10 mm I.D., 5 lm; Daicel Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan). Mobile phases for chromatography were prepared from HPLC grade solvents. Ethanol and n-hexane were obtained by J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ) and Tedia (Fairﬁeld, OH), respectively. HPLC enantioseparations were carried out by using a Shimadzu LC-10 pump equipped with a Rheodyne (Cotati, CA) injector with a 20-ll or 1-ml sample loop and a Shimadzu SPD-10 UV–vis detector. Speciﬁc rotations of the single enantiomers dissolved in chloroform were measured on a Perkin Elmer 241 polarimeter equipped with a Na lamp operating at 589 nm. The volume of the cell was 1 ml and the length of the optical path was 10 cm. Spectra were recorded at 258C. The CD spectra of the resolved enantiomers dissolved in chloroform (concentra- tion about 1.0 mg/mL) in a quartz cell (1.0 cm path length) were recorded by direct injection using a Jasco CD-2095 detector (Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo, Japan). The spectra are average computed over three instrumental scans and the intensities are presented in terms of elliptic- ity values (mdeg). *Correspondence to: Maysa Furlan, Organic Chemistry Department, Insti- tute of Chemistry, Sa˜o Paulo State University - UNESP, Francisco Degni Street s/n.

CHIRALITY 21:799–801 (2009) V V C 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Plant Material Leaves from Peperomia obtusifolia A. Dieter were col- lected in Poc¸os de Caldas, MG, Brazil, and identiﬁed by Dr. Ineˆs Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil). The voucher specimen (KATO 070) has been de- posited at the Herba´rio do Estado ‘‘Maria Eneyda P. Kauf- mann Fidalgo’’ (Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil). Specimens were cultivated under greenhouse conditions at the Institute of Chemistry-UNESP-Araraquara, SP, Brazil. Isolation of Compound 1 Fresh leaves from P. obtusifolia were frozen in liquid N2 and subsequently extracted with hexane at room tempera- ture. The organic extract was evaporated to dryness under vacuum and then submitted to prep. TLC over silica gel using hexane/ethyl acetate (70:30%, v/v) as eluent, affording com- pound 1 (Rf 5 0.3; [a]25 D 5 08, c 5 0.25, CHCl3). The spectral data (NMR and MS) were compared with literature values and were consistent with the structure described.5 HPLC Analysis The hexane extract and compound 1 were submitted to analytical chiral HPLC under the following conditions: iso- cratic elution using hexane/ethanol (99.5:0.5%, v/v), ﬂow rate of 0.7 mL/min, and UV detection at 254 nm. Before injection, the hexanic extract was cleaned up using a silica Sep-Pak1 cartridge (part no. 51900) Waters (Milford, MA), employing hexane and hexane/acetone (50:50%, v/v) as mobile phases. The hexane/acetone fraction was analyzed. Racemic Resolution The HPLC enantioseparation of 1 was carried out under isocratic elution using hexane/ethanol (99.5:0.5%, v/v), ﬂow rate of 3.5 ml/min, and UV detection at 254 nm. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The absolute conﬁgurations at C-2 have been estab- lished using Snatzke’s helicity rule for chromane deriva- tives, which belongs to the benzene chromophores with a chiral second sphere.6 The M-helicity of the chromane ring gave a positive Cotton effect (k 5 270–290 nm) for the enantiomer assigned as R (solid line) and the P-helic- ity a negative Cotton effect, considering the same band for the enantiomer assigned as S (dashed line) (Fig. 1). The R enantiomer (6.0 mg, Rt 5 33.0 min) showed [a]25 D 5 26.08 (c 5 0.3, CHCl3) and the S enantiomer (10.0 mg, Rt 5 37.0 min) presented [a]25 D 5 16.08 (c 5 0.3, CHCl3). The hexane extract, when analyzed by chiral chroma- tography, corroborated the presence of the racemic mix- ture of 1 (Fig. 2) from the initial extract step. This result conﬁrms that the racemic mixture of 1 was not produced by extraction and/or puriﬁcation conditions. Although there are some reports of chromanes isolated as racemic mixtures ([a]25 D 5 08) from plants and marine organisms,4,7 these results are opposite to the majority of reports concerning natural benzopyranes which have been isolated as enantiomerically pure compounds, e.g., tocopher- ols, chromenes from Rhododendrom dauricum,8 Piper gaudi- chaudianum,9 and Peperomia blanda,10 besides chromanols from Psammocinia sp.7 The ﬁnal ring closure step in these compounds is believed to be enzymatically controlled. The most well-characterized enzyme is tocopherol cyclase, which plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the chromanol sub- structure of the vitamin E family of compounds.11 The ﬁnding of a racemic mixture instead of an enantiomeri- cally pure metabolite raises questions about the ﬁnal steps in the biosynthesis of this class of natural products, suggesting that the intramolecular chromane ring formation step may not be enzymatically controlled at all in P. obtusifolia. Further studies are required to determine the biosynthetic pathways involved in the chromane ring formation and the relevance of the stereochemistry for the antiparasitic activity.
