Abstract--Six coumarins, four furoquinoline alkaloids, one glycosylflavonoid, two triterpenes, and one  steroid have been characterized from stems, leaves and fruit of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium Lam. var.  petiolulatum Engler (Fagara rhoifolium), of which one furoquinoline alkaloid is a new compound. The  composition is very different from other reported studies of Z. rhoifolium. The structures of the compounds  isolated were determined by spectroscopic methods.  Introduction  Zanthoxylum rhoifolium is widely distributed in South America, growing from French  Guiana to Brazil and Argentina. Z. rhoifolium shows cardiorespiratory activity [1] as  part of its pharmacological activity. It has also been used popularly against toothache  [2].  Zanthoxylum rhoifolium from Argentina, south of Brazil and Colombia has  previously been investigated. Tertiary and quaternary alkaloids, flavonoids and  triterpenes have been isolated [3-9].  The subject of the present paper is to report the presence of a new compound from  Z. rhoifolium collected in Anchieta, ES, Brazil. We also wish to show the difference in  the distribution of the metabolites depending on the organ and the region where the  plant was collected.  Materials and Methods  Plant material. Zanthoxylum rhoifolium was collected in Anchieta, ES, Brazil and a voucher (SPF 38205) is  deposited at the herbarium of the Instituto de Bioci~ncias, Universidade de S~o Paulo, SP.  Extraction and isolation of compounds. The fruits, leaves and stems plus bark were dried and extracted,  respectively, with petrol, CH2CI 2 and MeOH at room temperature during seven days [fruit 186 g, petrol 10.7 g  (EX-1), CH2CI 2 8.2 g (EX-2), MeOH 8.4 g (EX-3); leaves 781 g, petrol 18.7 g (EX-4), CH2CI 2 17.3 g (EX-5), MeOH  22.1 g (EX-6); stems+bark 773 g, petrol 1.6 g (EX-7), CH2CI ~ 2.2 g (EX-8), MeOH 11.4 g (EX-9)]. Extract 1 (EX-I)  was defatted as usual and 4.1 g of this extract was chromatographed on a conventional silica gel column  eluting with a mixture of hexane, CH2CI ~ and MeOH of increasing polarity. Each of the resulting fractions was  rechromatographed on Si gel TLC and the substances isolated are shown in Table 1. The extracts EX-2 (8.0 g),  EX-4+EX-5 (15.0 g) and EX-7 (1.0 g) were chromatographed on dry column over Si gel (50-380 g) deactivated  with 10% of water, using hexane: EtOAc (1:1, EX-2); CH2CI~: acetone (95:5, EX-4+EX-5), and CH~CI 2 (EX-7) for  elution. The columns were cut and the fractions were chromatographed by CC and/or TLC to yield the  compounds shown in Table 1. EX-3 and EX-6 were submitted to classical alkaloid extraction, crystallizing  skimrnianine. The rnethanolic solution was rechromatographed in CC of Si gel as described for EX-1 (Table 1).  EX-8 has the same composition as EX-7 by TLC. EX-9 was treated with pyridine and acetic anhydride under  reflux. The acetates (4.5 g) were chromatographed on a Bi gel column (150 g) using a mixture of CHiCle,  (CH3)2CO, MeOH as eluent, affording lupeol acetate and hesperidin acetate (Table 1).

CHEMISTRY OF ZANTHOXYLUM RHOIFOLIUM  175  Results and Discussion  The chromatographic separation of the extract of fruits, leaves and stems of Z.  rhoifolium allowed us to identify a total of 14 components (Table 1), of which  isopimpinellin (1) [10, 11], phellopterin (2) [11, 12], imperatorin (3) [10, 11], aurapten (4)  [11, 13], umbelliferone (5) [10, 14], 5'-hydroxyaurapten (6) [15], skimmianine (7) [16, 17],  haplopine (8) [18, 19], lupeol [20], lupenone [20], ~-sitosterol [21], and hesperidin (9)  [22] had already been described in the literature. A classical test for alkaloids was  carried out for the methanolic extract of leaves and was positive. The route for  isolation of quaternary alkaloids [23] was carried out but gave only skimmianine and  hesperidin.  The new natural substance, Z-dimethylrhoifolinate (10) is an amorphous solid, mp  99-101°C, with IR absorption at 1720, 1640, 1570, 1335, 1090 cm -1. Its high resolution  MS showed [M] + 291.07429 confirming the molecular formula (C14H13NO6).  Compound 10 possesses a seco ring A, having two methoxycarbonyl groups at C-7  and C-8 (13C NMR: ~ 166.03, 165.99 C-7, C-8 and ~ 50.27, 51.18 CO2Me), as well as an  0¢,~-unsaturated ester. The IR showed only one absorption (1720 cm -~) characterizing a  Rt  1- R I=OMe,R 2=Me  ~ O   2- R 1 =OMe,R 2=R !  3- R! = H,  R 2 = R 1  OR 2  OMe  4-R= R 2  5-R=H  6-R= R 3  RO  OMe  7-R-- Me  8-R= H  .2;  ~OMe  Rut O , ~   0~,,,..." ~  ~'OH  OH  O  9  OMe  MeO~  Me 0-~/ "N  u-  0  10  0  OMe  O  H o ~ M e 3   11  12  176  M.S.P.

In the 1H NMR an AX coupling system 6  6.16 and 7.26 (d, J=11.8 Hz) was attributed to H-5 and H-6 of Z-0c,~-unsaturated ester.  The 13C NMR for 10 showed signals ((~ 137.74 and 121.70) attributed to C-5 and C-6  which are in agreement with the structure proposed.  Compound 11, which is different from 10 only in the stereochemistry of the double  bond, trans in the latter, was detected in very small amounts as a contaminant of 10.  It was observed that there are important differences in the chemical composition of  Z. rhoifolium collected in different regions. Thus, mainly quaternary and tertiary  alkaloids were found in some areas, whereas in others coumarins and terpenoids were  found. Tables 1 and 4 show these data. It is also important to note that the chemical  composition of each plant organ is very different. In the present study coumarins were  found to occur in the leaves and fruits, but they were not found in the stems. The  opposite occurs with terpenes, which were observed in the fruits and stems (Table 1).  Conclusion  The structure of the new compound 10 is reinforced by its probable formation from  and co-occurrence with 7 and 8. The biosynthesis of 10 probably involves the  CHEMISTRY OF ZANTHOXYLUM RHOIFOLIUM  177  TABLE 4. COMPOUNDS OF ZANTHOXYLUM RHOIFOLIUM LAM. (ENGL.)* AND Z RHOIFOLIUM VAR. PETIOLULATUM (ENGL.)

Compound 11 is obtained by isomerization of 10.  The difference in the composition among each organ of the plant and the region  where they are collected is very important, especially when it is intended to use them  for pharmacological screening. It is also probable that the plant tested by Barros et al.  [1] contained mainly coumarins and skimmianine, as we have obtained in the present  study, in reason of proximity of the place of collection.  The isolation of secofuroquinoline alkaloids, together with the normal furoquinoline  alkaloids, represent a significant enlargement of the patterns of furoquinoline alkaloids  production previously noted in the Rutaceae. The reduction of the benzene ring of the  furoquinoline followed by ring-opening extends the pattern seen previously in  Haplophyllum [24].The compounds we have isolated from Z. rhoifolium reinforce its  position in the Rutaceae [25].
