Their structures were determined by IR, HRESIMS, and 1D and 2D NMR experiments, and their antioxidant activities, evaluated by assaying the free radical scavenging capacity using the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-pic- rylhydrazyl) radical as substrate. The antioxidant activities of 3 and 4 (IC50 values of 15.0 and 19.2 lM, respectively) were comparable to that of the standard positive control caﬀeic acid, whilst 2 and 5 were only weakly active and 1 was inactive. � 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Although Coussarea is considered to be only a small genus within the taxon Rubiaceae, it is well represented in the main Brazilian biomes including the Amazoˆnia and the Cerrado. Coussarea hydrangeifolia, commonly know as ‘‘falsa-quina’’, is characteristic of the vegetation of the Cerrado and of the semi-deciduous forests of Brazil, where it is considered to be a pioneer species (Cor- rea, 1974). In the course of our studies concerning the bioactive principles of Brazilian plants, with special emphasis on the vegetation of the State of Sa˜o Paulo (Pauletti et al., 2003; Hamerski et al., 2003), we found that the aqueous extract of the leaves of C. hydrangeifolia showed antioxidant activity, as determined by a prelimin- ary test with b-carotene, and strong free radical scaveng- ing activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH). Fractionation of this extract provided ﬁve phe- nylpropanoid glycosides including two new compounds, 1 and 2, which had their structures determined by spec- troscopic methods. 0031-9422/$ - see front matter � 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated from the aqueous extract of C. hydrangeifolia as an amorphous powder with an ½a�30 D of �44.3�. A quasimolecular ion peak [M � H]� for 1 was observed at m/z 415.1610 in the high-resolu- tion electrospray ionisation mass spectrum (HRESIMS; negative mode) suggesting a molecular formula of C19H28O10. The IR spectrum exhibited strong absorp- tion bands at 3430 and 1042 cm�1 suggesting the pres- ence of hydroxyl groups. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) displayed signals that could be attributed to a monosubstituted benzene ring [d 7.54 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-2,6), 7.30 (m, H-3,5), 7.23 (m, H-4)], a b-D-glucosyl moiety [d 4.90 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-10), 4.06 (dd, J = 7.5, 8.0 Hz, H-20), 4.19 (t like, J = 8.0 Hz, H-30), 4.12 (m, H-4), 4.20 (ddd, J = 9.5, 7.5, 2.5 Hz, H-50), 4.18 (dd, J = 11.0, 7.5 Hz, H � 60 a), 4.64 (dd, J = 11.0, 2.5 Hz, H � 60 b), and a rhamnosyl group [d 5.55 (d, J = 1.0 Hz, H-100), 4.62 (m, H-200), 4.55 (dd, J = 3.5, 9.0 Hz, H-300), 4.26 (t like, J = 9.0 Hz, H-400), 4.97 (m, H-5), 1.62 (d, J = 6.0 Hz, H-600). Additionally, the signals at d 4.85 (d, J = 11.5 Hz) and 5.15 (d, J = 11.5 Hz) could be as- cribed to benzylic oxymethylene hydrogens, thus cha- racterising the aromatic portion of 1 as a benzylic system. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed sig- nals at d 137.8, 128.2 (2·), 127.9 (2·), 127.2 and 70.9, which were consistent with the presence of a monosub- stituted benzylic ring. Two anomeric methine carbons at d 103.7 and 102.6, several hydroxymethines, one hydroxymethylene carbon at d 68.4 and one methyl group at d 18.7 resembled those of glucose and rham- nose, respectively, and clearly suggested that 1 possessed glucopyranosyl and rhamnopyranosyl units. Data from COSY and TOCSY experiments revealed the hydrogen sets belonging to the glucosyl and rhamnosyl moieties. The complete assignment of hydrogen and carbon sig- nals and the positions of the bonds of the sugar moieties in 1 were determined by an HMBC experiment which showed long-range correlations between H-60 and C-40 and the anomeric C-100, between H-100 and the methylene C-60, and between H-7 of the benzylic system and C-10 Table 1 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data of hydrangeifolin I (1), hydrangeifolin II (2) and 1,6-di-O-caﬀeoyl-b-D-glucopyranose (3) in pyridine-d5 Position 1 2 3 d 1H d 13C d 1H d 13H d 1H d 13C 1 – 137.8 (s) – 126.6 (s) – 127.6 (s) 2 7.54 d (7.5) 128.2 (d) 7.53 d (2.0) 115.8 (d) 7.05 m 111.7 (d) 3 7.30 m 127.9 (d) – 147.0 (s) – 148.8 (s) 4 7.23 m 127.2 (d) – 148.7 (s) – 149.5 (s) 5 7.30 m 127.9 (d) 7.16 d (8.0) 116.7 (d) 6.80 m 116.2 (d) 6 7.54 d (7.5) 128.2 (d) 7.10 dd (2.0; 8.0) 122.2 (d) 6.99 m 124.1 (d) 7 4.85 d (11.5) 70.9 (t) 7.97 d (15.5) 145.5 (d) 6.64 d (16.0) 114.8 (d) 5.15 d (11.5) 8 6.56 d (15.5) 114.4 (d) 7.93 d (16.0) 147.4 (d) 9 – 165.3 (s) – 169.6 (s) 10 4.90 d (7.5) 103.7 (d) 6.20 d (8.0) 96.1 (d) 4.48 d (7.4) 104.3 (d) 20 4.06 dd (7.5) 75.1 (d) 4.27 t (9.0) 78.8 (d) 4.04 t (9.0) 74.4 (d) 30 4.19 t (8.0) 77.2 (d) 4.34 m 78.5 (d) 3.95 t (9.0) 76.9 (d) 40 4.12 m 71.9 (d) 4.36 m 71.1 (d) 3.93 t (9.0) 71.0 (d) 50 4.20 ddd (9.5, 7.5, 2.5) 78.5 (d) 4.08 m 79.5 (d) 4.10 m 77.5 (d) 60 4.18 dd (11.0, 7.5) 68.4 (t) 4.40 d (12.0) 62.3 (t) 4.29 m 66.5 (t) 4.64 d (11.0, 2.5) 4.60 d (12.0) 4.39 m 100 5.55 d (1.0) 102.6 (d) 5.90 d (3.5) 94.2 (d) – 127.5 (s) 200 4.62 m 72.3 (d) 4.20 dd (3.5; 9.0) 74.6 (d) 7.05 m 111.7 (d) 300 4.55 dd (3.5; 9.0) 72.8 (d) 4.08 m 72.7 (d) – 148.8 (s) 400 4.26 t (9.0) 74.1 (d) 4.75 t (9.0) 75.5 (d) – 149.4 (s) 500 4.97 m 69.8 (d) 4.54 dd (2.5; 11.5) 63.1 (t) 6.80 m 116.2 (d) 4.42 dd (5.5; 11.5) 600 1.62 d (6.0) 18.7 (d) 6.99 m 124.1 (d) 700 6.52 d (15.5) 114.7 (d) 800 7.87 d (15.5) 147.1 (d) 900 – 169.7 (s) 1000 5.35 d (7.5) 99.6 (d) 2000 4.29 t (8.5) 74.3 (d) 3000 4.14 t (8.5) 76.9 (d) 4000 4.25 t (8.5) 72.2 (d) 5000 4.03 ddd (2.5; 5.5; 9.0) 78.6 (d) 6000 4.39 d (11.5) 63.3 (t) 4.58 d (11.5) 1928 L. Hamerski et al. / Phytochemistry 66 (2005) 1927–1932 of the glucosyl moiety and C-2/C-6 of the aromatic system. Consequently, the structure of 1 was established to be 10-O-benzyl-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(100 ! 60)-b-D- glucopyranoside, and this new compound has been named hydrangeifolin I. Compound 2 exhibited a quasimolecular ion peak [M � H]� at m/z 635.1828 in the HRESIMS (negative mode) suggesting a molecular formula C26H36O18. MS/MS analysis of the quasimolecular ion revealed a signiﬁcant fragment ion at m/z 502.1321 assigned to [M � H � deoxyhexose]�. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) clearly showed the presence of three sugar moieties together with nine additional signals that could be attributed to the aglycone moiety. Data from the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) indicated the pres- ence of an (E)-caﬀeoyl system [1H, d 7.97 (d, J = 15.5 Hz, H-7), 6.56 (1H, d, J = 15.5 Hz, H-8), 7.53 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2), 7.16 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-5), 7.10 (1H, dd, J = 2.0, 8.0 Hz, H-6)] together with three anomeric protons, two of which [5.35 (d, J = 7.5 Hz) and 6.20 (d, J = 8.0 Hz)] were as- signed to the two b-glucose units, and one [d 5.90 (d, J = 3.5 Hz)], to an a-xylose moiety. From the 13C NMR spectrum it could be established that the aro- matic unit was an ester of (E)-caﬀeic acid [d 165.3 (C-9), 145.5 (C-7), 114.4 (C-8), 126.6 (C-1), 115.8 (C- 2), 147.0 (C-3), 148.7 (C-4), 116.7 (C-5), 122.2 (C-6)]. Complete assignment of the protons in each sugar sys- tem was achieved by considering the 1D and 2D TOCSY, 1D and 2D NOESY, and the 1H–1H COSY spectra, while the carbons were assigned from HMQC and HMBC data. A 1D TOCSY experiment obtained by irradiating at the well-resolved anomeric proton at d 5.35 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) revealed a set of coupled oxymethine protons (d 4.29, 4.14, 4.25 and 4.03) and a methylene proton (d 4.39). These data, when ana- lysed with the correlated 13C NMR signals in the HMQC spectrum, led to the identiﬁcation of a b-D- glucosyl moiety. Its position at C-3 of the caﬀeic acid moiety was established unambiguously by HMBC cor- relations observed between the anomeric proton H-1000 at d 5.35 and C-3 (d 147.0), and from the proton at d 7.10 (H-6) to C-2 (d 115.8) and C-4 (d 148.7). A 1D TOCSY experiment obtained by irradiating at the well-resolved anomeric proton at d 6.20 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz) showed a set of coupled oxymethine pro- tons (d 4.27, 4.34, 4.36 and 4.08) and oxymethylene protons (d 4.40 and 4.60). Analysis of the correlated 13C NMR signals in the HMQC spectrum led to the identiﬁcation of an additional b-D-glucosyl moiety. From the HMBC correlation observed between the signals at d 6.20 (H-10) and d 165.3 [the carbonyl of the (E)-caﬀeoyl group], the site of esteriﬁcation with the (E)-caﬀeoyl acid unit was determined to be at C- 10 of the glucopyranosyl. The downﬁeld shift of C-20 (d 78.8) together with the upﬁeld shift of C-10 (d 96.1) of the b-glucopyranosyl unit also suggested that the a-xylopyranosyl unit was attached to C-20 of the glucopyranosyl moiety. The cross peak in the HMBC experiment between d 4.27 (t, J = 9.0 Hz, H-20) and d 75.5 (C-400), and the correlation in the NOESY experiment between the signals at d 4.27 (t, J = 9.0, H-20) and at d 4.75 (t, J = 9.0, H-400), conﬁrmed the (400 ! 20) linkage of the disaccharide moiety. Acid hydrolysis of 2 aﬀorded glucose and xylose, which were identiﬁed by TLC by comparison with authentic samples. Consequently, the structure of 2 was estab- lished as a-L-xylopyranosyl-(400 ! 20)-(3-O-b-D-gluco- pyranosyl)-10-O E-caﬀeoyl-b-D-glucopyranoside, and this new compound has been named hydrangeifolin II (see Fig. 1). Compound 3 was identiﬁed as 1,6-di-O-caﬀeoyl-b-D- glucopyranose from physical and spectroscopic data (Akhmedov and Litvinenko, 1968). Although this com- pound was ﬁrst isolated from Scrophularia grossheimi (a traditional medicinal plant used in Russia for the treat- ment of jaundice, hepatitis and rheumatism), to the best of our knowledge its 13C NMR spectroscopic data re- main unreported. The assignment of the 13C NMR sig- nals of 3, based mainly on 1D and 2D NMR experiments, is provided in Table 1. Compounds 4 and 5 were identiﬁed as 1-O-(E)-caﬀeoyl-b-D-glucopyranose and 1-O-(E)-feruloyl-b-D-glucopyranose, respectively (Birkofer et al., 1961, 1969). Preliminary TLC autographic test using b-carotene as revealing agent (Silva et al., 2001) evidenced several anti- oxidant compounds in the aqueous extract from leaves of C. hydrangeifolia. Compounds 1–5, isolated from this ex- tract, were evaluated for their free radical scavenging activity towards the stable free radical DPPH (Pauletti et al., 2003), and compared to standard antioxidants O O O HO HO OH O OH OH OH O O O HO O H H OH H OH H HO H H H H H H O H OH H H OH H HO O H HO OH H OH H H HO H 1 2 O HMBC NOESY Fig. 1.

As shown on Table 2, compounds 3 and 4 exhibited strong antioxidant activities, comparable with that of caﬀeic acid, probably due to the presence of the 3,4-dihy- droxy (catechol) moiety in their structures. Compounds 2 and 5, which bear only one free hydroxy group, showed weak free radical scavenging activities towards DPPH and compound 1 was inactive. 3. Experimental 3.1. General IR and UV spectra were obtained using Perkin–El- mer model 1600 series FTIR and Lambda 14P UV/ VIS spectrometers, respectively. ES-MS were measured on a VG Platform Fisons instrument and HRESIMS on a VG Autospec (40 eV) spectrometer. 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (125 MHz) and 2D NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Inova model 500 spec- trometer. The NMR data were measured in pyridine- d5 or DMSO-d6 and chemical shifts are expressed in d (ppm) values with reference to TMS. Preparative HPLC was conducted using a Phenomenex Luna ODS column (250 · 21.20 mm i.d.; 10 lm) coupled to a Varian Prep- Star S0-1 pump with ﬂow rate of the mobile phase set at 10 mL/min; and a Varian ProStar 320 UV/VIS detec- tor set at 254 nm.

Plant material Leaves of C. hydrangeifolia were collected in Mogi- Guac¸u (Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil) in December 1997 and identiﬁed and authenticated by Dr. Ines Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil). A vou- cher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Sa˜o Paulo (number SP 167423). 3.3. Antioxidant assay The b-carotene test was performed on TLC plates according to a previously described method (Pratt and Miller, 1984;Silva et al., 2001). The stable radical DPPH� was used for the determination of free radical scaveng- ing activity: a methanolic solution (200 lM, 2 mL) of DPPH was added to methanol (1 mL) containing an appropriate amount of each test compound in order to yield a ﬁnal concentration of 100, 80, 40, 20, 10 or 5 lM. Caﬀeic and p-coumaric acids were used as stan- dard positive controls, whilst a solution of DPPH (200 lM, 2 mL) in methanol (1 mL) served as blank. All samples were evaluated as triplicates (n = 3). Each reaction mixture was shaken thoroughly and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The amount of the reduced form of the radical (DPPH-H) generated in situ was determined from the measured de- crease in current (I) in the electrochemical cell of the ElCD (Son and Lewis, 2002). The area measured on each chromatogram was normalised and compared with that obtained for the blank. The radical scavenging activity of each sample was expressed in terms of IC50 (the concentration in lM of test compound required to produce a 50% decrease in I caused by the formation of DPPH-H) (Pauletti et al., 2003). 3.4. Extraction and isolation Dried and powdered leaves (2.70 kg) of C. hydrangei- folia were extracted with EtOH (3.0 L) for 24 h at room temperature, followed by solvent evaporation under re- duced pressure to yield the crude extract (65.80 g). This extract was suspended in water (3.0 L) and partitioned with n-BuOH (3.0 L): the aqueous solution was evapo- rated to dryness and the resulting residue (2.0 g) sub- jected to gel ﬁltration on a Sephadex LH-20 column (3.0 · 120 cm) eluted with MeOH. Fractions (10 mL each) were collected and analysed by TLC (CHCl3/ MeOH 6:4). On the basis of their TLC proﬁles, fractions 6–10 were combined (380.8 mg) and further subjected to over Sephadex LH-20 CC with MeOH as eluent. Frac- tions 8–12 from this second column fractionation were combined (54.3 mg) on the basis of their TLC proﬁles and puriﬁed by HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2 O (1:9) to yield 1 (12.0 mg; tR 12.54 min). Fractions 13–14 from the ﬁrst Sephadex column were combined (500 mg) and subjected to CC over C-18 eluted with a MeOH/H2O step gradient (in ratios 1:19, 3:17 and 3:2, successively) to yield fractions A, B and C. Fraction A (132.7 mg) was further puriﬁed by HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2O (7:93) to yield 2 (35.8 mg: tR 10.25 min). Fraction B (67.5 mg) was subjected to HPLC on an ODS column eluted with MeCN/H2O (1:9) to yield, 3 (6.1 mg; tR 22.38 min) and 4 (16.9 mg; tR 14.64 min). Fraction C (145.9 mg) was puriﬁed under the same conditions and aﬀorded 5 (8.4 mg, tR 18.91 min). 3.4.1.
