Additionally, 19 known compounds such as benzoic acids, chromenes, and flavonoids were isolated and identified. The antifungal activity of these compounds was evaluated by bioautographic TLC assay against Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum. Piperaceae species have been extensively investigated as a source of new natural products with potential anti- tumoral, antimicrobial, antifungal, and insecticidal activi- ties.1-3 The phytochemical profile in Piper species is characterized by the production of typical classes of com- pounds such as amides, benzoic acids, and chromenes in addition to lignans, neolignans, and a few alkaloids.4-6 As part of our research aiming to uncover new antifungal compounds in Brazilian Piperaceae species, we have previ- ously reported the occurrence of pyrrolidine amides in P. hispidum7 and piperidine, isobutyl, and pyrrolidine amides in P. tuberculatum8 and P. arboreum.9 Additionally, anti- fungal prenylated hydroquinones and flavanones from leaves of P. crassinervium10 have been described as well. The search for new antifungal compounds will contribute to establish a model for further investments in this field in order to preserve, to study, and to exploit rationally the remaining flora of Sa˜o Paulo State. In the course of the Biota Program (http://www.biota.sp), a large number of Piper species collected in the state of Sa˜o Paulo had their extracts assayed by means of bioau- tography using Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig). Since the extracts of Piper crassinervium Kunth, P. aduncum L., P. hostman- nianum (Miquel) C. DC., and P. gaudichaudianum Kunth showed high growth inhibitory activity, they were subjected to dereplication procedures using chromatographic tech- niques associated with the bioautographic assay. Thus, the major aim of this paper is to describe the isolation and structural determination of the new antifungal compounds from Piperaceae species. Results and Discussion The MeOH extract from leaves of P. crassinervium yielded three prenylated 4-hydroxybenzoic acids [4-hy- droxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethyl-3′-hydroxy-1′-oxo-6′-octenyl)benzo- ic acid (crassinervic acid, 1), 4-hydroxy-(3′,7′-dimethyl-1′- oxo-octa-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid11 (2), and 4-hydroxy- (3′,7′-dimethyl-1′-oxo-octa-2′-Z-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid11 (3)], 3,4,5-trimethoxydihydrocinnamic acid12 (4), 1,4-dihydroxy- 2-(3′,7′-dimethyl-1′-oxo-octa-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzene10 (5), and two flavanones [5,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavanone13 (nar- ingenin 4′-methyl ether, 6) and 5,4′-dihydroxy-7-methoxy- flavanone14 (sakuranetin, 7)]. The CH2Cl2- and hexane-soluble parts of the MeOH extract of the leaves of P. aduncum yielded one new prenylated benzoic acid [methyl 2-methoxy-5-(3′-methyl- 1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)benzoate (aduncumene, 8)], four known chromenes [methyl 2,2-dimethyl-8-(3′-methyl-2′-butenyl)- 2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (9), methyl 2,2-dimeth- yl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (10), methyl 8-hydroxy- 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylate (11), and 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid15,16 (12)], 4-methoxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), and two dihydrochalcones [2′,6′-dihydroxy-4′-meth- oxydihydrochalcone15 (14) and piperaduncine B17 (15)]. The CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extract of the leaves of P. hostmannianum yielded methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-ben- zopyran-6-carboxylate16 (10), three prenylated methyl hy- droxybenzoate derivatives [methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl- 2′-butenyl)benzoate18,19 (16), methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl- 2′-hydroxy-3′-butenyl)benzoate16 (17), and the new derivative methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(2′,3′-dihydroxy-3′-methylbutyl)ben- zoate (hostmaniene, 18)], and pinocembrin20,21 (19). The CH2Cl2-MeOH (2:1) extracts of the leaves and roots of P. gaudichaudianum yielded two chromenes [2-methyl- 2-(4′-methyl-3′-pentenyl)-8-(3′′-methyl-2′′-butenyl)-2H-1- benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (gaudichaudianic acid, 20) and methyl 2,2-dimethyl-1-oxo-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carbox- ylate22 (21)], three prenylated benzoic acids [4-methoxy-3- (3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid15 (13), 4-hy- droxy-3-(3′,7′-dimethylocta-2′-E-6′-dienyl)benzoic acid23 (22), and methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(3′-methyl-1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)ben- zoate24 (methyl taboganate, 23)], and pinocembrin20,21 (19). Compound 1 was isolated from the leaves of P. crassin- ervium as a white amorphous solid. Its molecular formula was established as C17H22O5 by analysis of its HREIMS spectrum (m/z 306.1459, calcd 306.1467). The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3380 cm-1), two carbonyl groups (1696, 1611 cm-1), and an aromatic ring (1489, 1421 cm-1).

Nat. Prod. 2004, 67, 1783-1788 10.1021/np030530j CCC: $27.50 © 2004 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 10/26/2004 for three aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.93 (d, J ) 8.9 Hz), 8.11 (dd, J ) 8.9 and 2.4 Hz), and 8.56 (d, J ) 2.4 Hz), indicative of a 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. Additional signals included three methyl singlets (δ 1.37, 1.50, 1.58), two doublets at δ 2.77 (1H, J ) 16.5 Hz) and 2.64 (1H, J ) 16.5 Hz), characteristic of an isolated R-carbonyl methylene group, and a triplet at δ 4.98 (1H, J ) 7.2 Hz), indicating the presence of a double bond in the side chain. The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) showed signals for 17 carbon atoms assigned as two carbonyl (δ 191.5, 170.6), six aromatic (δ 163.7, 137.3, 129.9, 122.1, 119.9, 118.8), two olefinic (δ 132.5, 122.9), three methyl (δ 25.6, 23.9, 17.5), one tertiary carbinolic (δ 82.3), and three aliphatic meth- ylenic carbons (δ 47.2, 39.3, 22.2). The assignments of the signals for aromatic carbons were based on comparison with 1H and 13C NMR data reported for known benzoic acids analogues.11 The connectivity between aromatic and aliphatic moieties was revealed by analysis of the HMBC spectrum. The correlations between signals at δ 8.56 (H-2)/2.77 (H-2′a)/2.64 (H-2′b) with 191.5 (C-1′) as well as between δ 8.56 (H-2)/8.11 (H-6) with 170.6 (CO2H) (Figure 1) indicated that compound 1 contains one carbonyl group at C-1′ and one carboxyl group attached to C-1. The double bond at the side chain was assigned on the basis of the observed cross-peaks between δ 4.98 (H-6′) and 25.6 (C-8′)/17.5 (C-9′) in the HMBC spectrum and between signals at δ 4.98 (H-6′), 2.03 (H-5′), 1.58 (H-8′), and 1.50 (H-9′) in the DQF-COSY spectrum. Thus, the hydroxyl group on a tertiary carbon atom was placed at C-3′ of the side chain, in agreement with the HMBC correlations observed between the hydrogen signals at δ 2.77 (H-2′a)/ 2.64 (H-2′b), 1.70 (H-4′), and 1.37 (H-10′) with the carbon signal at δ 82.3 (C-3′). Analysis of the DQF-COSY, HMQC, and HMBC NMR spectra allowed full assignment for all hydrogen and carbon atoms, and thus, the structure of crassinervic acid (1) was elucidated as 4-hydroxy-3-(3′,7′- dimethyl-3′-hydroxy-1′-oxo-6′-octenyl)benzoic acid. Compound 8 was isolated from the leaves of P. aduncum as a yellow amorphous solid. The molecular formula C14H16O4 was determined by LRESIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 1700, 1610, and at 1445 cm-1, assignable to two carbonyl groups and aromatic double bonds, respectively. The structure of the prenylated benzoic acid derivative was recognized by analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum, which showed signals at δ 8.18 (1H, d, J ) 1.9 Hz), 8.06 (1H, dd, J ) 8.5 and 1.9 Hz), and 6.93 (1H, d, J ) 8.5 Hz). This spectrum also showed a set of signals including two methyl groups at δ 1.96 (3H, d, J ) 1.5 Hz)/2.20 (3H, d, J ) 1.5 Hz) and a multiplet at 6.53 (1H), which are characteristics of an isoprene unit, and additionally, two methoxyl groups at δ 3.90 (3H, s) and 3.86 (3H, s). The 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) exhibited, in the low-field region, one carbomethoxyl group at δ 166.6, six aromatic carbons at δ 161.2, 134.1, 132.0, 131.2, 122.9, 111.4, and two signals corresponding to the double-bond carbons at δ 125.1 (CH) and 156.7 (C). These two signals, associated with the carbonyl signal at δ 192.7, indicated an R,�-unsaturated carbonyl system.22,25,26 The high-field region exhibited signals assignable to two methyl groups at δ 28.3 and 21.6 and two methoxyl groups at δ 52.5 and 56.2. The assign- ment of all signals observed in the 13C NMR spectrum of 8 was corroborated by HMQC and HMBC experiments (Figure 1). The HMBC spectrum showed the correlation of the signal at δ 192.2 (C-1′) with the hydrogens at δ 8.18 (H-6), 8.06 (H-4), and 6.53 (H-2′) and between δ 166.6 (C-6′) and 8.18 (H-6) and also with 3.86 (OCH3). Finally, the cross-peaks observed between δ 156.7 (C-3′) and 2.20 (H-4′) and 1.96 (H-5′) confirmed the structure of 8 as methyl 2-methoxyl-5-(3′-methyl-1′-oxo-2′-butenyl)benzoate, named aduncumene. Compound 18 was obtained from the leaves of P. host- mannianum, as a white amorphous powder. Its LRESIMS data associated with 13C NMR spectra (BBD and DEPT 135°) and elemental analysis indicated a molecular formula of C13H18O5. The IR spectrum indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups (3463 cm-1), an aromatic ring (1613, 1440 cm-1), and a carbonyl group (1715 cm-1). The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals assignable to three coupled aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.76 (d, J ) 9.0 Hz), 7.72 (dd, J ) 9.0 and 2.0 Hz), and 7.77 (d, J ) 2.0 Hz), characteristic of the 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acid derivative. In addition, this spectrum displayed three singlets at δ 1.27 (3H), 1.30 (3H), and 3.80 (3H) assigned, respectively, to two methyl groups attached to an oxygen-bearing carbon and to one methoxyl group. The presence of an oxymethine hydrogen at δ 3.77 (dd, J ) 6.0 and 4.5 Hz), associated with the signals at δ 3.02 (1H, dd, J ) 17.0 and 4.5 Hz) and 2.73 (1H, dd, J ) 17.0 and 6.0 Hz), suggested a hydroxylated isoprene side chain at C-3 of the benzoic acid nucleus. The HMBC spectrum of 18 (Figure 1) showed correlation between the signals at δ 31.1 (C-1′) and 7.77 (H-2), between δ 69.2 (C-2′) and 1.27 (H-4′)/1.30 (H-5′)/3.02 (H-1′a)/2.73 1784 Journal of Natural Products, 2004, Vol. 67, No. 11 Lago et al. (H-1′b), between δ 25.0 (C-4′) and 1.30 (H-5′), and between δ 22.0 (C-5′) and 3.77 (H-2′)/1.27 (H-4′), confirming the positioning of the vicinal hydroxyl groups at C-2′ and C-3′. The methoxyl group was determined as a methyl ester, considering that a cross-peak between the signals at δ 166.9 (C-6′) and 3.80 (OCH3) was observed in the HMBC spectrum. Therefore, the structure of 18 was determined as methyl 4-hydroxy-3-(2′,3′-dihydroxy-3′-methylbutyl)ben- zoate, named hostmaniane. Compound 20 was isolated from the leaves of P. gaud- ichaudianum as an amorphous solid. The molecular for- mula C22H28O3 was deduced by LREIMS and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3500, 1681, and 1601 cm-1 assignable to a hydroxyl, conjugated carbonyl, and aromatic ring, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum showed two doublets at δ 5.58 (1H, J ) 10.0 Hz) and 6.38 (1H, J ) 10.0 Hz) and four singlets at δ 1.41 (3H, s), 1.67 (3H, s), 1.56 (3H, s), and 1.73 (6H, s), which were associated with the chromene/isoprene moi- eties.15,27 Two low-field doublets at δ 7.59 (1H, J ) 2.1 Hz) and 7.75 (1H, J ) 2.1 Hz), assignable to the meta aromatic hydrogens, indicated a 3,4,5-trisubstituted benzoic acid derivative, which was corroborated by analysis of the 13C NMR spectra. A carboxyl group, with a signal at δ 172.1, was placed between the two aromatic hydrogens (C-6). The chromene moiety was confirmed by the presence of signals at δ 79.9, 129.5, and 121.9 assignable to the carbons C-2, C-3, and C-4, respectively.27 The DEPT 135° spectrum confirmed these previous assignments and showed the presence of three methylenes at δ 41.9 (C-1′), 22.7 (C-2′), and 28.2 (C-1′′), which were associated with the respective protons at δ 1.78 (H-1′), 2.25 (H-2′), and 3.28 (H-1′′) by means of the HMQC spectrum. The linkage positions of the two isoprene side chains to the chromene/aromatic ring were determined by an HMBC experiment (Figure 1), in which correlations between the signals at δ 128.9 (C-8) and 5.28 (H-2′′), between δ 131.8 (C-7) and 3.28 (H-1′′), between δ 41.9 (C-1′) and 1.41 (H-9), and between δ 123.9 (C-3′) and 1.78 (H-1′) were observed. Thus, the complete assign- ments of NMR data of 20 were made by analysis of HMQC and HMBC data and by comparison with those obtained for similar compounds isolated from P. lhotzkyanum and P. aduncum.11,28 Therefore, the structure of 20 was deter- mined as 2-methyl-2-(4′-methyl-3′-pentenyl)-8-(3′′-methyl- 2′′-butenyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid, named gaud- ichaudianic acid. The optical rotation, [R]25D +21 (c 0.1, CHCl3), was similar to that observed for sargatriol,29 but this compound has two additional chiral carbons (C5′ and C6′) in its side chain and is not appropriate for a direct comparison. Nevertheless, the CD curve obtained for 20 was fully opposite to that described for sargatriol including the positive Cotton effect at 260-280 nm (styrene chro- mophore). Thus, despite the differences in the substitution pattern in the aromatic ring for 20, the S configuration at C-2 was suggested. The antifungal activities of compounds 1-23 isolated from these four Piper species were evaluated against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum7 (Table 1). The fungitoxic potential for the compounds 5, 6, 7, 17, 19, and 21 has been previously reported.10,22,26,27 As can be seen, the chromene 9, crassinervic acid (1), and hostmaniane (18) showed high potential as antifungal compounds and should be further evaluated against other fungi. Several com- pounds, 2, 3, 5, 7, 16, and 19, showed potency (1.0 µg) similar to that of the control. In the prenylated benzoic acid series (1-3) the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the side chain, as in the case of 1, doubled the activity, while the changes in the double-bond configuration (2 and 3) did not cause significant improvement. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures.

The resulting extract (28.3 g) was dissolved in CHCl3 (100 mL) and partitioned with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (3 × 50 mL). The NaHCO3 solution was neutralized with HCl (6 M), extracted with EtOAc (3 × 50 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated, yielding 764 mg of residue.

Part of the extract from the leaves (4.5 g) was suspended in MeOH-H2O (8.5:1.5), filtered in a bed of Celite, and concentrated in vacuo to yield 2.5 g of the chlorophyll- free leaves extract. This extract was subjected to fractionation on a silica gel column using hexane with increasing amounts of EtOAc as eluent, yielding 15 fractions (1-15). Fraction 7 (50 mg) was subjected to preparative TLC [CH2Cl2-hexane- EtOAc-AcOH, 7.7:1.5:0.5:0.3, three elutions] to yield 20 (15 mg) and 23 (3 mg). Part of the crude CH2Cl2-MeOH extract from leaves (0.9 g) was dissolved in EtOAc (50 mL) and partitioned with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (3 × 50 mL). The NaHCO3 fraction was neutralized with HCl (6 M), extracted with EtOAc (3 × 50 mL), and dried over Na2SO4, yielding a residue (20 mg). This residue was subjected to preparative TLC [hexane-EtOAc, 9:1, three elutions], yielding 13 (4 mg) and 22 (7 mg). Part of the extract from roots (245 mg) was separated by circular chromatography (layer of 4 mm) and eluted with hexane with increasing amounts of EtOAc, yielding 23 (77 mg) and 21 (35 mg).

The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays, C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491, have been maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. For the antifungal assay 10.0 µL of solutions corresponding to 100.0 µg of crude extracts or semipurified fractions were applied to precoated Si gel TLC plates, developed with hex- ane-EtOAc (7:3), and dried for complete removal of solvents. For the pure compound 10.0 µL of solutions corresponding to 50.0, 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1 µg were applied to precoated Si gel TLC plates. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. cladosporioides or C. sphaerospermum in glucose and salt solution and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 °C, following the previously reported procedure.10,30,31 Fungal growth inhibition appeared as clear zones against a dark background, indicating the minimum amount of compounds 1-25 required for it (Table 1). Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls, whereas ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used as negative controls. Acknowledgment.
