Abstract-Secoisolariciresinol  monomethyl  ether and lariciresinol-4-methyl  ether were isolated  from the knots of  dead trees of Araucariu  angustifolia.  On the basis of spectral evidence,  the position  of the OH group was located in  these compounds.  The 13C NMR  spectra  of the phenyltetralin  lignans  galbulin,  galcatin,  isogalcatin  and cyclo-  galgravin  have also been recorded  and the signals assigned,  based on the methyl shifts of cyclogalgravin.  INTRODUCTION  Continuing  our investigations  on the constituents  of the  knots of Araucuriu  ungustifoliu 0. Ktze [l], we have now  isolated  pinoresinol  la and its monoMe  ether  lc, pre-  viously reported  from the same source by Anderegg  and  Rowe [2]* and two new monophenolic  lignans, secoiso-  lariciresinol  monoMe  ether  2a and lariciresinol-4-Me  ether  3ct.  The determination  of the position  of the  phenolic OH groups of 2a and 3c, deduced by comparison  of their O-Me derivatives  with known  products  and by  application  of spectroscopic  techniques,  together  with  some comments  on the effects of acetylation  on the 13C  NMR shifts of la and lc and the 13C NMR analysis of  some  phenyltetralin  lignans,  forms  the basis  of this  report.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  MS fragmentation  pattern,  M+, and ‘H NMR spec-  trum  of 2a indicate  a secoisolariciresinol  lignan-type  skeleton.  The base peak at m/e 151 and the peak at  m/e 137, together  with the OMe proton  signals (6 3.80  (6H) and 3.85 (3H)), suggested the presence of a dimethoxy  group and a methoxyhydroxybenzyl  group. On acetyla-  tion, 2a yielded a triacetyl derivative  2b, whose ‘H NMR  signals confirm the above observations  and further show,  on the basis of the doublet  at 6 6.87 (J = 7 Hz), that a  guaiacyl unit is present in 2a. Further  confirmation  of the  structure  of the secoisolariciresinol  monoMe  ether was  obtained  by analysis of its 13C NMR spectrum.  The car-  bon shifts of 2a, its triacetyl derivative  2b, the O-Me ether  2c and its diacetyl  derivative  2d (Table 1) show the ex-  pected effects in comparison  with the previously  reported  ones for secoisolariciresinol  and its tetraacetate  [ 11.  * This reference, in which the isolation of la, lb, pinoresinol  diMe ether, hinokiresinol,  isolariciresinol  and secoisolarici-  resin01 from the knots of A. angu@lia  is described, was not  cited in [l] since our main interest was the 13C NMR spectral  analysis of this group of natural products.  tThe nomenclature and numbering are those used in our  previous publication [l].

Further  con-  firmation  of the position  of the phenolic  OH function  in  3c was obtained  by preparation  of the alternative  struc-  ture 3e by careful methylation  of 3a. The shifts showed by  C-4 of 3e and its diacetyl  derivative  3f are the expected  ones, in agreement  with the above results. The carbon  shifts of compounds  3c-3f, together  with the shifts of the  acetate  of lariciresinol  diMe  ether  3g, not previously  reported,  are listed in Table 2.  An analysis of the shifts of C-l and C-l’ of lariciresinol  3a and its derivatives--mainly  the diacetates  3d and 3f-  indicates  that  our previous  assignments  at 133.7 and  131.6 ppm, respectively  [I], based on a comparison  with  the shifts of related  carbons  of the guaiacyl  units  of  secoisolariciresinol  and the neolignan  licarin A, were not  correct.  As shown  in Table 2, by reversal  of these two  assignments  a more consistent  set of shifts is obtained.  Further  support  for the new assignment  is obtained  by  comparison  of C-l’ shift of 3a (Table  2) with related  carbons  of the  benzofurans  4a (134.5 ppm)  and  4b  (134.3 ppm) [3]. Although  the stereochemistry  of 4a and  4b is not indicated  in reference  [3], they probably  repre-  sent better models  than the previously  selected  one for  C-l’.  That the phenolic  OH in 3c is located at C-4’ was con-  firmed by comparative  ‘H NMR and MS analysis of 3c  and 3e, and  their  corresponding  diacetyl  and  O-Me  derivatives  3d, 3f and 3g, respectively.  As was previously  observed  in sanshodiol  5 [4], acetylation  of the OH at  C-4’ induces  small, but significant  changes  on the ben-  zylic proton  signal at C-7’ of 3c (deshielding  of cu 5 Hz  and decrease  of J value), while the comparable  proton  signal of3e is unaffected  in the transformation  (3e -+ 3f).  *The designation 8.8’, 7.2’-neolignan has also been suggested  for the members  of this group  of natural  products.  In agreement  with these results, the MS of the diacetate  3d shows as its base peak the ion m/e 151, assigned  by  accurate  mass  measurements  to the ions 6a and 7a,  arising via benzylic (a) and path b cleavages, 8 [5], with  ketene  elimination,  respectively.  The benzylic  cleavage  of 3g also gives rise to a base peak at m/u 15 1, as expected  from the presence  of a dimethoxybenzyl  moiety, while in  3b and 3f, the same benzylic cleavage with loss of ketene  produces  base peaks at m/e 137, 6b. Further,  in 3f and  3g the fragment  at m/e 165, 7b, arising by path b is also  detected.  The observed  effects of acetylation  on the ‘H NMR  signal of the benzylic  protons  adjacent  to the guaiacyl  units of 2,6-diaryl-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.O]octane  lignans,  such as pluviatilol  and xanthoxylol[4;  61, prompted  us to  compare  the 13C NMR shifts of those carbons  of pino-  resin01 la, its monoMe  ether lc and the acetyl derivatives  lb and Id, hoping to detect features that could be used to  supplement  previous studies [6,7] for the structure  eluci-  dation  of other members  of this group  of natural  pro-  ducts. However,  as in the case of the monoMe  ethers of  Iariciresinol  3c and 3e, acetylation  of the phenolic  OH  produces  the known effects on the aromatic  carbons  of  la and lc, while the benzylic  ones are practically  un-  affected.  The carbon shifts of compounds  la--ld, assigned  on the basis of previous  results [6, 71, on 13C-‘H long-  range couplings  and on specific proton  decoupling  data,  are listed in Table 3.  Following  our “C NMR spectral  studies on lignans  183, the analysis  of the natural  phenyltetralins  with  identical  relative  configurations  at C-7, C-8 and C-8’,  galbulin 9a, galcatin 9b and isogalcatin  9c [9]*, together  with cyclogalgravin  10, easily obtained  by acid treatment  of tetrahydrofuran  lignan  galgravin  [lo],  was carried  out.

As expected, and according  to the  known effects of an OH group on the a, fi and y carbons,  C-9, C-9’, C-8 and C-8’ are shielded  while C-7 and C-7’  are deshielded  in 9a, 9b and 9c in comparison  to related  sites of 11. The replacement  of the 3’,4’-dimethoxy  groups  of 9s and 9c by the methylenedioxy  unit of 9b, produces  the expected  changes  on the ring A carbon  shifts, i.e.  shielding  of C-3’, C-4’, C-2’ and C-5’ and deshielding  of  C-l’ and C-6’ by magnitudes  similar to those previously  observed  [l 11.

Comparison  of the aromatic  shifts  of 9a with those found for isolariciresinol  diMe ether 11  shows significant  differences  for the shifts at 131.7 and  137.6 ppm assigned  to C-l and C-6, respectively  [l]. It  then seems reasonable,  on the basis of the present results,  to reverse the previous  assignment.  The carbon  shifts of cyclogalgravin  10, based  on a  comparison  with those of 9a, on the analysis of the sford  spectrum  and on the effects produced  by the introduction  of a double bond on the endocyclic  homoallylic  positions  [12], are listed  in Table 4. Distinction  of some close  resonances  like those of C-6 and C-7’, and C-l and C-8’  was made  by specific  proton  decoupling  and “C-‘H  long-range  couplings,  while  the signals  at 126.9 and  127.1 ppm remain  for C-l’ and C-6’ or vice versa.

Galbulin, 9a, and its relatives 9b and 9c, possess the  same relative configuration  of the substituents  on ring B  and it would be expected to prefer a half-chair conforma-  tion with the phenyl and both methyls  at pseudoequa-  torial positions,  as was shown by ‘H NMR spectroscopy  [13]. On the assumption  that a neighbouring  double  bond does not affect the chemical  shift of a Me group  [14], it could be expected  that the flattening  of ring B,  because of the introduction  of the double bond between  C-7’ and C-8’ in 10, will induce a shielding  effect on the  Me groups as a consequence  of the decrease in the dihe-  dral angle between them. In cyclogalgravin  10, however,  the Me groups  are deshielded  compared  with those of  9a, 9b and 9c, indicating  a preferred  conformation  pre-  viously  suggested  for 1,2_dihydronaphthalenes  by ‘H  NMR spectroscopy  [ 151, in which C-9 and ring C are at  i)Me  10  II  pseudoaxial  positions.
