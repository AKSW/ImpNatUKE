© 2011 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen · http://znaturforsch.com Introduction In the last decades considerable efforts have  been devoted to the discovery of new sources of  botanical insecticides and antifeedants. Among  the plant families studied, Meliaceae and Ruta- ceae are perhaps the most promising (Schoon- hoven, 1982), at least partly due to the presence  of limonoids and triterpenoids characteristic of  the Rutales order. The biological activity of limo- noids from Rutales has been reviewed (Cham- pagne et al., 1992). Some neem-based botanical  insecticides have already been developed and  marketed (Schmutterer, 1990, 1995, 2005). Carapa guianensis Aublet, also called andiroba,  andiroba-saruva, iandirova, carapá, and nandiro- ba (Lorenzi and Matos, 2002), is a tall Meliaceae  tree growing wild throughout South America,  West India, and South Africa. In Brazil, it can be  found prevalently in ﬂ ooded areas of the Ama- zon rainforest (Ambrozin et al., 2006). From the  nuts of this plant an oil, called andiroba oil, is ex- tracted, which has a long history of traditional use  in South America, as analgesic, anti-inﬂ ammatory,  insecticide, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and as an  anticancer remedy (Bickii et al., 2000; Gilbert et  al., 1999; MacKinnon et al., 1997; Moura et al.,  2002). Andiroba oil is rich in fatty acids such as  oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids, together  with 2 – 5% of unsaponiﬁ able material. In addi- tion, from several parts of Carapa guianensis li- monoids, triterpenes, steroids, coumarins, ﬂ avo- noids, and diglycerides have been isolated (Lavie  et al., 1973; Marcelle and Moto, 1975; Ollis et al.,  1964, 1970; Qi et al., 2003, 2004). Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. (Meliaceae)  (“canjarana”) is a native tree of economic impor- tance in Brazil. It is a dioecious tree with wide- spread distribution in the neotropics, extending  from Costa Rica to southern Brazil and northern  Argentina. According to Pennington et al. (1981),  it inhabits mainly nonﬂ ooded evergreen lowland  or lower hill rain forests. In the present paper, triterpenoids and limo- noids isolated from C. canjerana and C. guianensis  were examined for their effects on the fall army- worm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepi- doptera: Noctuidae). S. frugiperda is a major pest  of many crops in the Americas and one of the  most important pests of tropical maize, causing  up to 34% reduction in the overall productivity  of this crop in Brazil (Cruz et al., 1996).

Gedunin was used as a  positive control. 7-Deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin and β-photogedunin reduced the pupal weight  as occurred with gedunin. Cabraleadiol, 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide, and 7-deacetoxy-7-oxoge- dunin prolonged the larval phase similar to the control (gedunin) of approximately 1.2 days  at 50.0 mg kg–1. The highest insecticidal activity was obtained for β-photogedunin. Key words: Spodoptera frugiperda, Limonoids, Triterpenoids Unauthenticated Download Date | 9/2/15 2:05 PM 246 A. L. F. Sarria et al. · Triterpenoids and Limonoids against Spodoptera frugiperda Material and Methods Plant material Cabralea canjerana was collected at the Univer- sidade Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, MG, Brazil, and  identiﬁ ed by T. D. Pennington from the Royal Bo- tanic Garden, Kew, UK. A voucher (1842; 1983) is  deposited in the herbarium of Departamento de  Engenharia Florestal Dendrologia, Universidade  Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The arillus of the Carapa guianensis seeds were  supplied by Cognis Brasil Ltda., Av. Nações Uni- das 10989, 4° andar, São Paulo, SP, Brazil. Compounds isolation Fruits (460 g) and seeds (200 g) from C. can- jerana were extracted with ethanol, at room tem- perature for three times. The ethanolic extract  (88.3 g) of the fruits was submitted to liquid-liquid  partition with 120 ml methanol/water (3:1, v/v)  solution. This solution was partitioned with dif- ferent solvents to give fractions in n-hexane (fr- Hex, 47.4 g), dichloromethane (fr-CH2Cl2, 5.4 g),  ethyl acetate (fr-EtOAc, 4.4 g), and methanol (fr- MeOH, 11.9 g). The fraction fr-Hex (2.8 g) was  submitted to a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh,  4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 45 fractions of 50 ml) using n- hexane/dichloromethane/ethyl acetate/methanol  of increasing polarity as mobile phase, yielding  nine fractions (fr-Hex.1 to fr-Hex.10) after TLC  analysis. The fraction fr-Hex.2 (102 mg) was re- chromatographed by column chromatography  using Sephadex LH-20 as stationary phase (col- umn 3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., 26 fractions of 10 ml each)  with isocratic elution (methanol/dichloromethane,  1:1, v/v), yielding three fractions (fr-Hex.2.1 to fr- Hex.2.3) after comparison by TLC analysis. The  fraction fr-Hex.2.2 (88.6 mg) was rechromato- graphed on a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh,  3.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 10 fractions of 5 ml each) eluted  with n-hexane/acetone (9:1, v/v) to afford ocotil- lone (1, 16.3 mg) and cabraleadiol (2, 24.4 mg). The ethanolic extract (14.3 g) of the seeds of  C. canjerana was chromatographed on microcry- stalline cellulose-D and silica gel (column 5.0 x  22.0 cm i.d., fractions of 250 ml each) using n-hex- ane (250 ml) followed by dichloromethane (1 l),  acetone (1 l), and methanol (1 l) as mobile phas- es yielding 13 fractions (EES-1 to EES-13). The  fraction EES-2 (1.72 g) was chromatographed on  a silica gel column (230 – 400 mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm  i.d., 69 fractions of 10 ml each) using n-hexane/ acetone/methanol of increasing polarity as mobile  phase to yield eleven fractions (EES-2.1 to EES- 2.11) which were joined based on TLC. The frac- tion EES-2.6 (293.4 mg) was rechromatographed  by column chromatography using a Sephadex LH- 20 column (3.2 x 64.0 cm i.d., fractions of 10 ml  each) with isocratic elution (methanol), yielding  ﬁ fteen fractions (EES-2.6.1 to EES-2.6.15). The  fraction EES-2.6.7 afforded methyl angolensate (3,  48.2 mg). The fraction EES-2.7 (230.6 mg) was re- chromatographed on a silica gel column (230 – 400  mesh, 4.0 x 16.0 cm i.d., 35 fractions of 10 ml each),  using n-hexane/ethyl acetate (8:2, v/v) as mobile  isocratic phase, yielding seventeen fractions (EES- 2.7.1 to EES-2.7.17). The fraction EES-2.7.9 af- forded 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide (4, 63.7 mg). The arillus ethanolic extract (10.0 g) of C. gui- anensis was submitted to vacuum chromatography  using silica gel as stationary phase (70 – 230 mesh,  column 30 x 5 cm i.d.) and n-hexane followed by  CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH (1 l each) as mobile  phases, yielding four fractions (H, D, Ac, Me).  The fraction Ac (3.8 g) was submitted to column  chromatography over silica gel (230 – 400 mesh, 30  x 4 cm i.d., n-hexane and acetone gradient as elu- ent, starting with pure n-hexane and ﬁ nishing with  pure acetone, 32 fractions of 200 ml each) to give  ﬁ ve fractions (Ac1 to Ac5). The fraction Ac3 (3.0 g)  was rechromatographed on a silica gel column  (230 – 400 mesh, 10 x 3 cm i.d.) eluted with solvents  of increasing polarity (CH2Cl2 to MeOH, 28 frac- tions of 50 ml each) to yield ten fractions (Ac3.1 to  Ac3.10). The limonoids 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin  (5, 24.4 mg) and β-photogedunin (6, 14.4 mg) were  isolated from fraction Ac3.2 by recycling HPLC  (Asahipack polymeric column; eluent, methanol/ dichloromethane, 7:3, v/v; ﬂ ow, 4 ml min–1). Biological activity Larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith)  were obtained from the Insect Bioassay Labora- tory of Universidade Federal de São Carlos, São  Carlos, SP, Brazil, and reared on semi-artiﬁ cial   diets (Kasten et al., 1978; Parra, 1986). They were  maintained in an incubation chamber with a pho- toperiod of 12 h light/12 h dark, (70  5)% rela- tive humidity, and (25  1) °C. For each treatment and control, 30 neonate  larvae of S. frugiperda were used. A solution of  compound was added to ascorbic acid (1.56 g; an  Unauthenticated Download Date | 9/2/15 2:05 PM A. L. F.

After evaporation of the  solvent, the mixture was incorporated into the  semi-artiﬁ cial diet in which bean and wheat germ  are the basic ingredients (Kasten et al., 1978) at  ﬁ nal contents of 1.0, 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 mg kg–1  for 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (5), and 1.0, 10.0,  and 50.0 mg kg–1 for ocotillone (1), cabraleadiol  (2), methyl angolensate (3), 3-β-deacetylﬁ ssinolide  (4), and β-photogedunin (6). The diet for the con- trol was prepared similarly but without the tri- terpenoids or limonoids. Gedunin (7) was used as  positive control. The diets were placed in previously  sterilized glass tubes (8.5 cm × 2.5 cm), into which  larvae of S. frugiperda were introduced individu- ally. The pupae were weighed 1 d after pupation  and were transferred to plastics cups, where they  stayed until the emergence of adults. Daily obser- vations were made and the following parameters  were evaluated: (1) duration of larval and pupal  phases, (2) weight of pupae, and (3) percentage of  dead insects (mortality) at the end of each phase. Statistics Data were submitted to an analysis of variance  ANOVA (Zar, 1974), and the averages were com- pared applying the Tukey test (P  0.05). Each  tube containing one insect, independent of the  developed phase, was considered as one replicate,  therefore, the number of replicates was different  for each treatment. For evaluation of the mortal- ity of the larvae and pupae, the experimental unit  was constituted by the mean of ﬁ ve tubes contain- ing one larva each, with six replications by treat- ment. Results and Discussion The triterpenoids 1 and 2 and limonoids 3 and  4 were isolated from the fruits and seeds of C.  canjerana and the limonoids 5 and 6 from the aril- lus of C. guianensis (Fig. 1). Their structures were  conﬁ rmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and  comparison with data from the literature (Braga  et al., 2006; Ambrozin et al., 2006). Compounds 1 – 6 were incorporated in the  semi-artiﬁ cial diet. 2, 4, and 5 affected larval de- velopment (Table I), and only 6 affected pupal  development at concentrations of 10 and 50 mg  [(8.5  1.64) days and (8.9  1.25) days, respec- tively, control (10.1  1.45) days].

Larvae fed with semi-artiﬁ cial diet treated with  2, 4, and 5 at 50.0 mg kg–1 prolonged the larval  time for approximately 1.2 days similar to gedun- in, suggesting that these compounds act as larval  growth inhibitors (Table I). Compounds 2 and 4 prolonged the larval phase,  although no alteration in pupal weight was ob- served. Tanzubil and McCaffery (1990) observed  that larvae treated with low doses of azadirachtin  produced pupae with a weight comparable to that  of the controls, suggesting that they did not expe- rience any severe feeding inhibition. Compound 5 also effected prolongation of the  larval phase followed by reduction of the pupal  weight. The larvae treated with 5 showed prolonga- tion of the larval phase by 1.4 days (at 50.0 mg  kg–1)  and 2.6 days (at 100.0 mg kg–1) when compared  with the control (14.9 days, Table I). The reduction  of the pupal weight was by 17.8 and 25.8 mg at 50.0  and 100.0 mg kg–1, respectively, when compared  with the control (262.5 mg, Table I). Larvae treated with 6 at 1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mg  kg–1 presented reduction of the pupal weight by  30.0, 31.1, and 31.5 mg, respectively, when com- pared with the control (272.7 mg, Table I).

Ocotillone (1) isolated from the leaves of  Dysoxylum malabaricum (Govindachari et al.,  1994) was tested against Spodoptera litura and  showed excellent PFI (percentage feeding in- dex) values comparable to those of azadiradione,  epoxyazadiradione, and limonin (Govindachari et  al., 1995). Methyl angolensate (3) exhibited insecticidal  activity against S. litura in no-choice tests (Ab- delgaleil and Nakatani, 2003; Suresh et al., 2002;  Powel et al., 1991), and this result agrees with  that observed in the present work. Isolated from  diethyl ether and acetone extracts of the stem  bark of Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae) 3 showed  antifeedant activity by the conventional leaf disc  method on the third-instar larvae of Spodop- tera littoralis (Boisd., Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  at 500 μg ml–1 (Abdelgaleil and Nakatani, 2003;  Suresh et al., 2002) in a study examining struc- ture-insect antifeedant relationships of plants  belonging to the Rutales order. In a dual-choice  antifeedant bioassay against Spodoptera litura L.  (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), methyl angolensate (3)  showed a PFI of 65.3, near to that of cedrelone  (51.5). Two limonoids (sandoricin and 6-hydroxy- sandoricin) isolated from seed extracts of Sando- ricum koetjape Merr. (Meliaceae), which possess  chemical structures similar to that of methyl an- golensate (3), showed signiﬁ cant antifeedant ac- tivity against the fall armyworm (S. frugiperda),  incorporated in diet at 25 ppm, and similar activ- ity against the European corn borer (ECB), Os- trinia nubilalis Hübner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae),  at 200 ppm. Toxicity results for both insects indi- cated that continued feeding on diets containing  sandoricin or 6-hydroxysandoricin at the 200 ppm  level would result in nearly 100% mortality prior  to pupation (Powell et al., 1991). β-Photogedunin (6) presented the highest in- secticidal activity against S. frugiperda causing  mortality of 53.3% in the larval stage and 20.0%  in the pupal phase at 50 ppm. These results agree  with those of Céspedes et al. (2000), who tested  an epimeric mixture of photogedunin and their  corresponding acetates and observed that these  compounds caused signiﬁ cant mortality of S. fru- giperda larvae (45% to 100% at 10.0 to 52.0 ppm)  after 7 days, as well as growth reduction, and pho- togedunin acetates showed the highest insecticid- al activity at 10.0 ppm with 17% survival. Compounds 1, 3, 5, and 6 showed moderate in- secticidal activity at 50.0 mg kg-1 with 40.0, 40.0,  33.3, and 53.3% mortality, respectively, for the lar- val phase. Although the compounds tested here  were less active than the positive the control ge- dunin (7, 63.3%), the use of these compounds,  in particular 6, is suggested for the control of S.  frugiperda. Comparison of the activities of 6 and  7 suggests that oxidation of the furan ring led to  a decrease in the insecticidal activity.
