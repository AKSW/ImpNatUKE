Abstract-Evolution  of limonoids in the Meliaceae appears to be consistent with the resistance of Melioideae  against the shoot borer Hypsipyla. The limonoid chemistn/ of Toona, which has shown absence of attacks of  H. grandella, is reminiscent of Melioideae. An investigation of ?I cilafa, has led to the identification of two  novel meliacin butenolides, 21-hydroxycedrelonelide  and 23-hydroxycedrelonelide,  two known limonoids,  cedrelone and 23_hydroxytoonacilide,  and sitosterol, a-amyrin and fi-amyrin acylated with fatty acids. Three  known coumarins, siderin, scopoletin and isofraxidin were also isolated. All structures were established from  spectral data. Some ‘X NMR signals for cedrelone are reassigned.  Introduction  Efforts to establish large-scale homogeneous plantations of native Meliaceae have  almost invariably failed due to larval attacks by the shoot borer Hypsipyla  (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The host range of thrs oligophagous pantropical genus is  limited principally to the Swietenioideae. Of this sub-family, important species of the  genera Khaya and Entandmphmgma in Africa, Swietenia and Cedrela in Latin America  and Toona in Asia and Australia are attacked. However, Toona ciliata introduced to  Brazil shows excellent growth and an absence of attacks by H. grandella, in contrast to  the native Cedrela odorata. The latter has been grafted to stems of b cilata and the  resistance has been translocated from the Mona stock to the Cedrela graft (Grijipma,  1970).  To determine the phytochemical basis of this resistance we have now undertaken a  further investigation of the stem of the exotic Z cilata.  Materials and Methods  General NMR spectra were run at 25’C using a 5 mm ‘H or 13C probe with observation frequencies of 200 and  50 MHz, respectively, containing TMS as internal standard, ‘H-“C COSY long-range correlation: 3,/c,, = 7 Hz.

The stems  (640 g, l&year old tree and stems worked with a diameter of 3 cm) were dried, powdered and extracted with  hexane, CH,CI, and MeOH. The hexane extract (32.0 g) was chromatographed  on silica gel eluting with  hexane, then hexane containing increasing amounts of CH,CI, and finally with EtOAc yielding in order 4 (400  mg), 23-hydroxytoonacilide  (40 mg), a mixture of sitosterol, a-amyrin and fi-amyrin acylated with fatty acids,  and a mixture of 2 (5 mg) and 3 (27 mg). The last compound was then purified by TLC (MeOH-lsopropanol-  tAuthor to whom correspondence  should be addressed.  (Received 26 August 1993)  323  324  S.M.M. AGOSTINHO ETAL.  hexane, 4:10:30). The triterpenes and sitosterol, obtained by hydrolysis, were acylated with acetic anhydride  in pyridine prior to analysis by low resolution GC-MS.

Results and Discussion  Evolution of limonoids in the Cedreloideae  Chemically, the family Meliaceae is distinguished by the frequent occurrence of  extremely characteristic limonoids which are easily connected by mechanistically  justifiable biogenetic reasoning from a common precursor (Scheme 1). This precursor,  1, suffers oxidative opening of rings B/D to give 1.1 and 1.1.1, or of rings A/B/D to 1.1.2,  or of rings A/B to 1.2 and 1.2.1, or of ring C to 1.3.  Genera of Swietenioideae contain meliacins formed along only one biosynthetic  route (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1,2, Scheme 1). In contrast, genera of Melioideae, the other major  TABLE 1.1H NMR CHEMICAL SHIFTS FOR 2-4 AND SELECTED PROTONS IN 5 AND 6  H  2  3*  4  5  6  1  6.91 d  6.80 d  6.89 d  (9.9)  (9.9)  (9.9)  2  6.14 d  6.99 d  6.08 d  (9.9)  (9.9)  (9.9)  9  2.66 m  11/16~  1.72-1.97 rn  12o~  2.06 br dd  (12)  12~]  1.66 br dd  (12)  15  3.83 s  3.65 s  3.77 s  16¢  2.27 dd  (14, 6.5)  17  2.76 dd  (14, 6.5)  18  0.87 s  0.71/0.661" s  0.73 s  19  1.25 s  1.16 s  1.27 s  21  5.84 brs  7.12 brs  5.93 m  22  5.90 brs  6.95 brs  6.16 brs  6.02 m  6.95 m  23  6.09 brs  7.34 brs  6.14 m  28  1.58 s  1.46 s  1.55 s  29  1.50 s  1.37 s  1.47 s  30  1.12 s  0.98 s  1.10 s  OH  6.42 s  6.60 s  6.46 s  Resonances in 4 were confirmed by 1HPH, 1H/~ZC and 1H/lZC LR shift-correlated two-dimensional spectra.

The situation regarding the Cedreloideae, represented by Cedrela and Toona, is  more complex. Pennington and Styles, in their more recent monograph, include  Harms' Cedreloideae into the Swietenioideae and particularly the Cedreleae (Harms,  1940; Pennington and Styles, 1975), The known limonoids (1, 1.1, Scheme 1) from  Cedrela are typical of the Swietenioideae subfamily (Silva et al., 1984). On the other  hand, the limonoid chemistry of Toona (1, 1.2, Scheme 1) is reminiscent of Melioideae,  since the known compounds comprise intact ring-D and ring-A/ring-B dilactones, a  feature typical of Trichilia limonoids (1, 1.2.1, Scheme 1) (Silva et al., 1984; Silva and  Gottlieb, 1987). Thus, the affiliation of Toona to the Swietenioideae is rather  problematic.  The difference in meliacin composition in Pennington's tribe Cedreleae appears to  be consistent with the resistance of exotic Toona to native H. grandella. The  elucidation of the toxicant(s) present in Toona could clarify the basis for resistance.  Isolation of compounds  The hexane extract from the stem of T. ciliata, afforded two new meliacin  butenolides  2  and  3,  besides  two  known  limonoids  cedrelone (4)  and  23-hydroxytoonacilide, and a mixture of sitosterol, 0¢-amyrin and ~amyrin acylated  with fatty acids. The known compounds were characterized by comparison with  published spectral data (Halsall and Troke, 1975; Kraus and Grimminger, 1980).  Compound 2 exhibited similar spectral data to cedrelone (4). The 1H NMR  spectrum (Table 1), instead of signals for a furan unit, showed two broad singlets  326  S.M.M.

The codes (1, 1.3 etc) refer to the position of the structural types on a  comprehensive biogenetic map [13].  (G 5.90 and 5,84) suggesting a y-hydroxybutyrolactone. This was corroborated by the  13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which showed signals for a hemiacetal carbon (G 98.2  C-21) and an ¢,l~-unseturated-7-1actone (G 151.9, C-20; 119.8, C-22 and 168-2, C-23).  These signals indicate the presence of a 21-hydmxy-20(22)-ene-21,23-h'-Iactone by  comparison with the 1H and 13C NMR data published for isonimocinolid (5) and  nimocinolid (6) (Siddiqui et al., 1986). Moreover, the chemical shifts of the ring A-D  carbons were comparable with those reported for cedrelone (Halsall and Troke, 1975)  (Table 2). The new natural product is therefore 21-hydmxycedrelonelide (2).  Compound 3 showed spectral characteristics close to those of 2. The principal  change observed in the ~HNMR (Table 1) of 3 was the deshielded resonances (G 6.80  and 5.99) for a y-hydroxybutyrolactone. This was also supported by the ~3C NMR  spectrum (Table 2) which agreed closely with published date for a 23-3'-hydroxy-  butenolide moiety related to that of 6. The structure of the new natural product was  thus established as 23-hydroxycedrelonelide (3). As a further confirmation of the  assignments, cedrelone was oxidized to a mixture of 2 and 3 by a photo-oxidation  reaction. The mixture was separated by preparative TLC. Compounds 2 and 3 could  be artefacts of the isolation procedures. However, the stem examined here gave  23-hydroxytoonacilide  and  no 21-hydroxytoonacilide. Thus, this observation  suggested that both 2 and 3 are naturally occurring.

The 1H-13C COSY and DEPT experiments on cedrelone, permitted minor corrections  to previous 13C NMR assignments (Halsall and Troke, 1975) (Tables 1-3). Table 2 shows  that the signals for C-9, 11, 12, 17, 21, 23 and 28 were reassigned.  The methanol extract from the stem of T. ciliata gave three coumarins which were  identified by comparison with published data as scopoletin (Wagner and Bladt, 1975),  siderin (Nagasampagi et al., 1975) and isofraxidin (Borris et al., 1980). This appears to  be the first record of isofraxidin from Meliaceae or from the allied families of the order  Rutales (Rutaceae, Simaroubaceae, Cneoraceae and Burseraceae).  As a result of this study T. ciliata has been shown to have a chemical profile that is  closely comparable to that of Trichilia (Silva et aL, 1984; Silva and Gottlieb, 1987). The  occurrence of the meliacin butenolides is a feature of both Toona (Kraus and  Grimminger, 1980) and Trichilia (Arenas and Hahn, 1990; Cortez et al., 1992]. Thus, the  TABLE 3.

The resistance of exotic T. ciliata and Trichilia species to native Hypsipyla may well  be owing to the presence of the A,B-seco limonoids (1.2, 1.2.1). The B-seco limonoids,  toonacilin and its 6-acetoxy derivative and their oxidized furan derivatives, isolated  from T. ciliata, have shown activity as feeding repellents against the Mexican bean  beetle Epilachna varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (Champagne et al., 1992).  However, it is premature to draw any conclusions about the role of limonoids in a  possible coevolutionary relationship between Meliaceae and Hypsipyla, until isolated  limonoids can be evaluated in direct bioassays with this insect.
