Abstract--From the seeds of Toona ciliata were isolated, besides toonacilin, two novel limonoids: 12-deacetoxytoona-  cilin and 6~-acetoxy-14fl,15fl-epoxyazadirone. These results do not seem to support the affiliation of Toona to the  Swietenioideae.  INTRODUCTION  Toona was originally described by Endlicher (1840) as a  section of Cedrela [11. However, Roemer later (1846)  recognized that they could be separated by a number of  sound morphological characters, raising Toona to generic  rank and most monographers have followed this lead [11.  Thus, the old world species of Cedrela were transferred to  Toona (Endlicher) M. J. Roemer. The two genera were  placed by Harms (1940) in the tribe Cedreleae under  Cedreloideae [21. Pennington and Styles, in their more  recent monograph, include the Cedreleae in the Swieten-  ioideae [3].  As reported in previous papers [4, 51 genera of Swie-  tenioideae explore limonoid chemistry along only one  route which leads to the mexicanolide group. In contrast,  genera of Melioideae should form the more primitive  taxon, split off from the common ancestral lineage before  synthesis of the mexicanolide types. The ring B-seco  limonoids then persisted into the Melioideae with devel-  opment of the ring C-seco limonoids. The known limon-  oids from Cedrela are typical of the Swietenioideae [4, 51.  On the other hand, Toona appear to be peripheral  Melioideae as well as Swietenioideae [4, 5].  Recently, we have described the isolation and identi-  fication of two novel meliacin butenolides, 21-hydroxy-  cedrelonelide and 23-hydroxy-cedrelonelide from the  stem of T. ciliata [6]. These limonoids are very closely  related to those isolated from the melioid genus Trichilia  [7, 81, showing that the affiliation of Toona to the Swie-  tenioideae is still rather problematic. Clearly much more  *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.  detailed phytochemical investigations of Toona species  will be essential for a better understanding of its chemo-  taxonomic position in the Meliaceae.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The dichloromethane extract from the seeds of T.  ciliata, afforded three typically Meliaceous limonoids.  The limonoid I showed all the spectral data (Tables 1 and  2) of toonacilin which have previously been isolated from  the bark of T. ciliata [9, 101. Toonacilin can assume any  of several rotations, although the rotamer I appears to be  sterically the most favourable, since very strong correl-  ations between H-5 and H-11, and between Me-19 and H-  30b were revealed from NOESY experiments (Table 3).  Moreover, there was a strong correlation between H-9  and H-30b.  The limonoid 2 showed spectral data (Tables 1 and 21  suggestive of a structure similar to toonacilin, but having  only one ct-acetoxyl substituent in ring C (3 5.23 br s, 70.9).  The tH-1H COSY spectrum revealed the oxymethine  proton to be coupled only to the tH signal at tS1.89 (H-  12). The signal for H-9 was still visible as a broad single!  at t52.46 as in l, so placing the ~-acetoxyl substituent at C-  11. This was supported by the NOESY spectrum which  showed a very strong correlation between H-11 and H-. ~  (Table 3). The correlations between H-30b and H-9, and  between H-30a and H-15 confirm their assignments and  are consistent with the stereochemistry as in 2 (ct-H at C -c  and ~t-H at C-15).  A  1H-13CCOSY  experimenl  permitted the assignments of all the protonated carbon,  including the tertiary methyl groups. The quaternar 3  carbons were assigned on the basis of the 1H-t3C lon$  range correlations listed in Table 4. Thus, the observec  397  398  J.O. NETO et al.

The new natural  product is, therefore, 12-deacetoxytoonacilin (2).  Compound 3 exhibited similar spectral data to surenin  (4), which has previously been isolated from the leaves of  Toona sureni (Blume) Merill [11]. The 13CNMR spec-  trum (Table 2) showed signals at 6157.6 (C-l), 126.1 (C-2)  and 204.6 (C-3), characteristic era ring A 1-en-3-one, as in  the model compound 5 [12], instead of an ~t,fl-  unsaturated 6-1actone. Moreover, the chemical shifts of  the ring B-D carbons were comparable with those re-  ported for surenin (Table 2). From several 2D experi-  ments it was possible to assign the chemical shifts for  many protons and all carbons in the molecule (Tables 1  and 2). The assignment of the stereochemistry of the  acetoxy groups received further support from NOESY  experiments which showed very strong correlations of H-  6 and H-7 with Me-30, and H-6 with Me-29. The new  natural product is, therefore, 6~t-acetoxy-14fl, 15fl-epoxy-  azadirone.  The chemical evidence to hand strongly supports  Roemer's taxonomic conclusions. However, limonoids  (ring B-seco) of Toona can be considered to be biogenetic  precursors of the mexicanolide types which are common  in Cedrela, suggesting a direct derivation of this latter  from Toona-like ancestors.

Isolation of constituents. Toona ciliata was collected in  Viqosa, MG, Brazil, and a voucher is deposited in the  Herbarium of Departamento de Engenharia Florestai,  Universidade Federal de Vi¢osa, Vigosa, MG. The seeds  were dried, powdered and extracted with hexane, CH2CI 2  and MeOH. The CH2Clz extract (77.5 g) was submitted  to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using hexane,  hexane-CH2Cl 2 (1 : 1), CH2CI 2, CH2CI2-EtOAc (1 : 1),  EtOAc and MeOH. The CHzCI2-EtOAc fr. was chro-  matographed on a DCCC (hexane-EtOH-EtOAc-H20,  5: 4: 2: 1, ascending method). The organic fr. yielded a ppt.  of 1 (150 rag) and 2 (90 mg) which was purified by 2 prep.  TLC (silica gel, hexane-CH2CI2-MeOH, 12.5:12.5:0.5;  silica gel, hexane-EtOAc-MeOH, 20:5:0.5). The re-  maining organic fr. was rechromatographed over silica  gel using hexane-CH2Cl 2 (1:1), CH2Clz, EtOAc and  MeOH at different ratios of increasing polarity, yielding  25 frs. Frs 8-12 were purified by prep. TLC (silica gel,  bexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 12.5:12.5:0.5) to yield a new ft.  containing 3 (20 mg). The latter was then repurified by  prep. TLC (silica gel, bexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 20:5: 0.5).  Toonacilin (1).
