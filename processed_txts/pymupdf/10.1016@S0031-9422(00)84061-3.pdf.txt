Abstract-Two  new alkaloids have been isolated from root bark and leaves of Aspidosperma pyrifolium and identified  as ( + )-aspidospermine and 6-demethoxypyrifoline.  INTRODIJCCION  Several studies on Aspidosperma pyrifolium have reported  the isolation of pyrifoline (1) [l, 21 and pyrifolidine (2) [l,  33 from trunk bark, and aspidofiline (3) [4,5] from leaves.  As part of a chemical and pharmacological screening of  Brazilian plants a strong hypotensive effect of the crude  alkaloids from root bark and leaves of A. pyrgofolium was  detected on the arterial blood pressure of the dog.  As the roots of the plant have not been investigated  before, it was decided to carry out a chemical investigation  of these parts as well as to reinvestigate the alkaloids in the  leaves because of their pharmacological properties.  RESULTSANDDISCUSSION  A. pyrifolium, a tree popularly known as ‘pereiro-preto’,  is widely distributed  in north-east  Brazil. The plant  studied was collected in Sobral, Cead in .4ugust 1980. The  crude alkaloids were isolated from an ethanolic extract of  the leaves and three alkaloids were purified by prep. TLC  on Si gel. The major alkaloid was identified as pyrifoline  (1) by comparison of its ‘H NMR and mass spectra with  those recorded for pyrifoline previously isolated from the  trunk bark of the same species [l, 21.  The second substance presented spectral data similar to  pyrifoline,  except for the absence in the ‘H NMR  spectrum of the aliphatic methoxyl peak (6 3.31), suggest-  ing the structure 6-demethoxypyrifoline  (4) for this al-  kaloid. The mass spectrum exhibited a M+’ 352 in  agreement with the molecular formula, C,2H2,N,0,,  and peaks at m/z 324 [M+ - 28]+‘, 309,281,124 and 109  (base peak) all characteristic of the aspidosperma alkaloid  skeleton.  The third alkaloid was identified as aspidofiline (3) by  analysis of spectral data and by comparison  with an  authentic sample.  From a chloroform extract of the roots was isolated  aspidospermine  identified by its spectral data (mass  and  ‘H NMR spectra) and mp [6]. To establish the configur-  ation of 6-demethoxypyrifoline  (4), it was necessary to  Taken in part from the M.Sc. thesis of Leila MBriam Serur  presented to the Universidade Federal do Cearti.  Presented at the 1982 Meeting of the American Society of  Pharmacognosy, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.  compare its ORD curve with similar data from (+)-  pyrifoline with a known configuration  [7]. The ORD  curve of (+)-aspidospermine  was also obtained  and  compared with data recorded for (-)-aspidospermine  [8]. The three alkaloids exhibited positive Cotton effects  and showed almost superimposable  curves. From these  observations  it is possible to conclude  that the as-  pidospermine isolated from A. pyrSfolium belongs to the  (+) series and that it is the antipodal isomer of the known  (-)-aspidospermine  (6). Determination  of [a]?  gave a  value of + 92” whereas the lit. value for the laevo isomer is  - 92”. The occurrence of the new aspidosperma-type  6-  demethoxypyrifoline  could be biosynthetically associated  with the presence of pyrifoline, which is the major base  present in the leaves of A. pyr$olium.  Although  the isolation  of aspidospermine  from A.  pyrifolium has already been reported [6], on the basis of its  optical rotation it is now possible to report the natural  occurrence of the dextrorotatory isomer for the first time.  In spite of the fact that (-)-and  (+)-quebrachamine  (7)  are biosynthetic precursors of the aspidospermine  skele-  ton presumably by C-12 + C-19 ring closure [9-l l] it is  surprising that only ( -)-aspidospermine  is reported in the  lit. The present isolation of the dextro aspidospermine (5)  gives a strong support for the above hypothesis.  EXPERIMENTAL  Leaves of A. pyriJolium  Mart. (lOkg, dry wt) were extracted  with EtOH in a Soxhlet apparatus.  The EtOH extract was coned  at 45-50” in a rotatory  evaporator.  To the residue was added 1 N  H,S04  (5OOml) with stirring. The aq. phase was extracted  with  Et,0  at different  pH values (3,5,7,9 and 12). The Et,0  extracts  obtained  at pH 9 and 12 were combined  and coned under red.  pres. giving  54 g of a dark  residue.  This residue  (log)  was  chromatographed  on prep. Si gel H + PFzs4+ 366 (3: 1) plates  using C,H,-Me&O-MeOH  (9:2.5: 1) as eluent. Three fractions  of prepurified  alkaloids  were obtained.  Each fraction  was further  chromatographed  by prep. TLC at pH 6 with Pi buffer. From ca  500 plates were isolated  three pure alkaloids  (1 g each).  (+)-Pyrifoline  (1). White crystals from petrol, mp 138-140” (lit.  [l],  141-144”).
