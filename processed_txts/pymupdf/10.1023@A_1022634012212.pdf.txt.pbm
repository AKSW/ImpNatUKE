Washington Luiz Km 235 CEP 13565-905 S˜ao Carlos-SP, Brazil (Received March 21, 2002; accepted October 10, 2002) Abstract—Comparative gas chromatographic analyses of airborne volatiles produced by males and females of the sugarcane weevil Sphenophorus levis, showed one male-speciﬁc compound. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry data indicated an aliphatic alcohol that was identiﬁed as 2-methyl-4-octanol. Both optical isomers were synthesized in ﬁve steps by employing commercially available (R)- and (S)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol as starting ma- terial. Enantiomeric resolution by gas chromatography with a chiral column demonstrated that the natural alcohol possessed the S conﬁguration. Prelimi- nary indoor observations suggested that the alcohol elicited aggregation behav- ior among adults. The same compound has been previously described as an aggregation pheromone in several other curculionid species.

INTRODUCTION Sphenophorus levis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a weevil found in northern Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil and develops mainly on sugarcane (Vanin, 1988). This species was described as a pest in 1977 and was classiﬁed as a new species in 1978 (Precetti, and Arrigoni, 1990). In Brazil it has been detected in sugarcane only in the state of S˜ao Paulo, with an endemic incidence in a southwestern region of the state (Vanin, 1988). The use of synthetic insecticides for control of this insect has been unsuccessful due to its behavior at the larval stage. During this time, similar to other species of this family, S. levis tunnels in sugarcane stalks, destroying tissues and weakening the plant. (Cerda et al., 1999). The increasing economic and agricultural importance of this pest in Brazil led us to investigate the feasibility of using its pheromone system for pest management. Male-produced aggregation pheromones have been described in several cur- culionidae belonging to the same subfamily (Rhynchophorinae) as S. levis (Rochat et al., 1991; Hallett et al., 1993; Oehlschlager et al., 1995; Giblin-Davis et al., 2000). A similar species also found in Brazil, Metamasius hemipterus, produces six male-speciﬁc compounds (Ramirez-Lucas et al., 1996a; Perez et al., 1997) but only two of them seem to be essential as attractants (Ramirez-Lucas et al., 1996b; Perez et al., 1997). M. hemipterus and S. levis belong to the same taxonomic class; however, huge morphological and behavioral differences have been found between them. Here we are compiling the ﬁrst results of our studies on the chemical ecology of S. levis, reporting the identiﬁcation, synthesis, and absolute conﬁguration of a male-speciﬁc chiral compound that we believe to be the aggregation pheromone of this species. METHODS AND MATERIALS Collection of Insect Volatiles. Adult weevils of mixed age, sex, and mat- ing status were collected in a sugarcane plantation at the Centro de Tecnologia da Copersucar, Piracicaba, in December 1999 and January 2000. They were provided with sugarcane stalks and transported to Curitiba. Weevils were sep- arated by sex and kept in the laboratory at 25◦C under a 14 L:10 D photope- riod. Groups of 60 males and females were placed in different all-glass aera- tion chambers (Zarbin et al., 1998a), and the volatiles were trapped on Super Q (Alltech, Deerﬁeld, Illinois, USA) columns for 6 days. A humidiﬁed charcoal- ﬁltered airstream (1 liter/min) was maintained through the aeration apparatus. The columns were washed with distilled hexane, and the extracts were concentrated to 10 insect equivalents (10 IE/� L) under an argon stream in a clean conical bottom vial. (Zarbin, 2001).

Gas chromatographic analyses were per- formed on a Varian 3800 GC equipped with FID, eletronic pressure control, and operated in splitless mode. The following capillary columns were used: VA-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 � m), oven temperature 50◦C for 3 min, programmed at 5◦C/min to 150◦C, held for 1 min, then rising 10◦C/min to 270◦C and held at this temperature for additional 10 min; and VA-Wax (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 � m), oven temperature 50◦C for 3 min, increased to 220◦C at a rate of 7◦C/min, and held for 10 min. Mass spectra were recorded on a Varian Saturn 2000 GC-MS-MS ion trap detector using the same type VA-5 capillary column under the same condi- tions as described above. The equipment was operated in the electron impact (EI) ionization mode (70 eV) and in the chemical ionization (CI) mode (CH3CN). Chi- ral separations were obtained on a cyclodextrin-based capillary column [heptakis (2,6-di-O-methyl-3-O-phenyl)-� -CD, 20% in OV-1701, w/w, 25 m, 0.25 mm ID] using helium as carrier gas (38 psi) at 60◦C. The IR spectra refer to ﬁlms and were measured on a Bomem M-102 spectrometer. The 1HNMR spectra were recorded with TMS as an internal standard at 400 MHz on a Bruker ARX 400 spectrometer. The 13CNMR spectra were recorded with TMS as an internal standard at 100 MHz on a Bruker ARX 400. Optical rotations were measured on a Bellinghan + Stanley Ltd model D polarimeter. Puriﬁcation of Male-Speciﬁc Compound. Crude male aeration extracts were subjectedtopuriﬁcationonsilicagelcolumnselutedwithhexane–ethermixturesof increasing polarities (100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 50:50, 20:80, 0:100). The male- speciﬁc compound was recovered along with a small amount of other impurities in the hexane–ether 70:30 fraction. This sample was again carefully fractionated by eluting with hexane:ether mixtures (90:10, 85:15, 80:20, 75:25, 70:30, 65:35, 60:40). In the hexane–ether 75:25 fraction, the compound was isolated in good purity to be submitted to chiral analyses. Synthesis. All reagents and solvents used in the syntheses were of high- est commercially available standard. Chromatographic puriﬁcations were car- ried out on silica gel 60, Merck, 230–400 mesh. Racemic 2-methyl-4-octanol (1) (Scheme 1) was prepared by reaction of butyl magnesium bromide with SCHEME 1. Synthesis of (±)-2-methyl-4-octanol (1) and (±)-3-methyl-4-octanol (2).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Gas chromatographic (GC-FID) analysis of the airborne volatiles produced by males and females of the sugarcane weevil S. levis showed the presence of one male-speciﬁc compound (Figure 1). The base peak observed on GC-EI mass P1: GDX Journal of Chemical Ecology [joec] pp751-joec-459299 February 18, 2003 19:13 Style ﬁle version June 28th, 2002 382 ZARBIN ET AL. FIG. 1.

The m/z 126 was deduced to be due to a M−18 peak, resulting from loss of water, indicating a possible molecular ion (M+) at m/z 144 (Figure 2). However, even employing chemical ionization with CH3CN, the molecular ion of the compound could not be detected. The hypothesis that the target molecule was a linear and symmetrical structure such as 5-nonanol was ruled out, since the MS of the compound gave an ion at m/z 111, typical M−33 of methyl branched alcohol that results from loss of CH3 and H2O (Silverstein et al., 1991). Moreover, the retention time (Rt) of FIG. 2. Mass spectra of the male-speciﬁc compound of S. levis. Inset: major fragmentation patterns of the molecule.

At this point, the data suggested only two possible chemical structures for this com- pound; 2-methyl-4-octanol (1) or 3-methyl-4-octanol (2). In order to determine unambiguously the correct structure of this male-speciﬁc compound, both alco- hols were synthesized as racemates and used as authentic references (Scheme 1). The mass spectrometric characteristics of both standards were identical to those of the natural product, but only the 2-methyl-4-octanol (1) exhibited identical retention times on two different GC columns (VA-5 and VA-Wax). Thus, the chemical structure of the male-speciﬁc compound was deduced as 2-methyl-4- octanol. While the carbon skeleton was determined, nothing was known about the conﬁguration of the stereogenic center. One way to investigate the stereochem- istry of chiral volatiles is to obtain enantiomeric resolution on a chiral column. The assignments of the peaks can be carried out with samples of known stere- ochemistry, and the absolute conﬁguration of the natural product is determined by comparison of its retention time under the same conditions (Leal et al., 1996). In order to determine the absolute conﬁguration of naturally occurring 1, we developed a short enantioselective synthesis for both enantiomers, as described in Scheme 2. Our route utilized commercially available (R)- and (S)-2,2-dimethyl- 1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol (3) as a starting material, which were transformed into the tosylates (4) in 88% yield (Perkins et al., 1992). Compounds (5) were ob- tained by coupling tosylates (4) with n-propyl magnesium bromide, catalyzed by CuBr · Me2S, in 55.6% yield (Zarbin et al., 2000). Hydrolysis of ketals (5) under acidic conditions furnished the diols (6) in 99% yield. The highly volatile epoxides (7) were obtained in “one pot” from diols (6) in 37% isolated yield, by reaction with tosyl chloride and powdered KOH (Francke et al., 1995; Jurczak et al., 1986; Kuwahara et al., 1997). Finally, the epoxides (7) were reacted with 1-methylethyl magnesium bromide catalyzed by CuI, affording the target compounds (1) in 82% yield (Takenaka et al., 1996; Baraldi et al., 2002). SCHEME 2.

At present, the biological role of the compound identiﬁed in this work is unknown or, at least, uncertain. However, preliminary laboratory observations employing rubber septa as releaser suggest that the racemic compound elicits aggregation behavior among both males and females of this species. As already mentioned, the same compound has been identiﬁed as a male-produced aggre- gation pheromone in several other curculionidae species (Perez et al., 1997; Ramirez-Lucas et al., 1996a,b; Giblin-Davis et al., 2000).
