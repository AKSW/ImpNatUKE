Cassia spectabilis, Leguminosae). Two semi-synthetic analogues (7 and 9) inhibited rat brain acetylcholinesterase, showing IC50 of 7.32 and 15.1 lM, and were 21 and 9.5 times less potent against rat brain butyrylcho- linesterase, respectively. Compound 9 (1 mg/kg, ip) was fully eﬃcacious in reverting scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice. The two active compounds (7 and 9) did not show overt toxic eﬀects at the doses tested in vivo. � 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Alzheimer�s disease (AD) is a late-onset, progressive and eventually fatal neurodegenerative disorder whose prev- alence is increasing together with the life expectancy throughout the world. Because cognitive deﬁcits in AD are associated with the disruption of central cholinergic transmission, cholinergic-boosting drugs have been the mainstay of current therapy.1 Tacrine (THA, Cognex�, 1) was the ﬁrst synthetic drug approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration for AD treatment. This substance is a centrally-acting cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) that shows moderate eﬀect in relieving AD symptoms of mild and medium intensity. However, its application became limited due to serious side eﬀects, like hepatotoxicity that forced patients to discontinue the treatment.2 Besides THA, currently there are three other ChEI drugs available in USA and Europe for AD treatment: donepezil (2, Aricept�), rivastigmine (3, Exelon�), and galanthamine (4, Reminyl�) (Fig. 1). Of these, compounds 1, 2, and 4 are reversible inhibitors, while 3 acts pseudo-irreversibly. These compounds also diﬀer with regard to selectivity for acetyl- (AChE) versus butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and central versus peripheral activity.3 Galanthamine (4) is a natural prod- uct that has the additional eﬀect of allosterically poten- tiating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and it has been used as a prototype in anti-cholinesterase drug development.2,4 The structural diversity of known ChEIs and the possi- bility to explore distinct modes of action have stimulated phytochemical studies with plant and microorganism species that can furnish new anti-cholinesterase struc- tural motifs. In this context, various species have been investigated as possible sources of ChEIs based on ethn- obotanic data or reports of their popular use.5 In the search for new bioactive agents, we have recently isolated the new piperidine alkaloid, (�)-3-O-acetyl- 0968-0896/$ - see front matter � 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This observation led us to design derivatives that could be active as ChE inhibitors. In this paper we report the semi-synthetic preparation of ﬁve piperidine alkaloid derivatives (compounds 7–11) and the pharmacological study by using Ellman�s assay,9 tests of scopolamine-in- duced amnesia and acute toxicity. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Chemistry For the preparation of the target derivatives 7–11 from O-acetyl-spectaline (5) and (�)-spectaline (6) we fol- lowed the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 1. Carbon- ate derivative 12 was obtained in 60% yield after its column chromatography puriﬁcation from a 2:1 mixture with carbamate 13, resulting from treatment of 6 with (Boc)2O/Et3N in CH2Cl2.10,11 On the other hand, chemoselective reduction of keto-carbonyl group of derivative 5 with NaBH4 in MeOH furnished the diaste- reomeric mixture of alcohols 14, in 97% yield. Next, treatment of the piperidine derivatives 5, 6, 12, and 14 with HCl in CH2Cl2, under anhydrous conditions, yielded almost quantitatively the corresponding hydro- chlorides 7, 8, 9, and 10. Additionally, tertiary ammo- nium derivative 11 was prepared in 50% yield by treatment of acetate 5 with methyl iodide in acetone at reﬂux. Alternatively, compound 7 could be prepared in 95% yield from more abundant natural (�)-spectaline7 (6) through its direct treatment with acetyl chloride in anhydrous chloroform. All structures were in agreement with analytical and spectral data.12 2.2. Pharmacology The bioactivity of compounds 7–11 as inhibitors of mammalian central nervous system cholinesterases was investigated in rat brain tissue, as previously de- scribed.13 Concentration-response curves were obtained Figure 2.

Chem. 13 (2005) 4184–4190 4185 for all new compounds 7–11, and their mean inhibitory concentration (IC50) was estimated (Table 1). Com- pounds 7 and 9 were eﬀective inhibitors of AChE, show- ing mean IC50�s of 7.32 and 15.1 lM, respectively. On the other hand, compounds 8 and 10–11 achieved less than 50% inhibition at the highest concentration tested (200 lM), therefore their IC50�s should be considered rough estimates. The presence of the acetyl group in 7 conferred a 30-times gain in potency with respect to (�)-spectaline hydrochloride (8), prepared from the more abundant natural alkaloid (6). The anti-cholines- terase activity of 7 is consistent with the hypothesis of an acetylcholine-mimicking property of the molecule (Fig. 2). Thus, the N-methyl substitution in the piperi- dine ring in 11 would be expected to increase potency, because of the greater similarity with the ammonium group in acetylcholine. However, the inhibitory potency was markedly reduced in 11, suggesting that the methyl group introduced steric hindrance to the ionic interac- tion of the charged nitrogen. This unfavorable behavior might occur with 11, but not with acetylcholine, because of conformational con- straints imposed by the ring structure. Addition of the t-Boc group to the acetyl moiety in 9 slightly reduced the potency in comparison with 7. The diﬀerence be- tween 7 and 9 may be analogous to that between acetyl- choline and butyrylcholine with respect to AChE.14 Compounds 7 and 9 were then chosen for testing in a rat brain BuChE assay, in order to assess their selectivity and to further explore the analogy with the choline es- ters. Compounds 7 and 8 showed similar IC50 in the BuChE assay, both being less potent than in the AChE assay. Their selectivity indices (SI) of 21 and 9.5 (for 7 and 9, respectively) are higher than that of the standard centrally acting inhibitor, THA (1) (Table 1) or galan- thamine (4).15 The observation that brain BuChE did not distinguish the compounds with and without the t- Boc subunit is further evidence that the choline ester-like motif may interact with the enzyme by mimicking the substrates. The selected compounds 7 and 9 were tested in vivo for their ability to prevent scopolamine-induced amnesia in Scheme 1. Synthesis of piperidine derivatives 7–11.

Chem. 13 (2005) 4184–4190 two tasks, passive avoidance and water maze.16,17 In the passive-avoidance test, the step-down latency in the training session was around 5 s in all experimental groups (4.8 ± 0.3 s for all animals). Mice were tested for retention of the avoidance task 24 h after the train- ing procedure. The control animals showed a 15-fold in- crease in the step-down latency in this test session, remaining on the wooden platform for 79.3 ± 10.6 s (n = 22). Animals given the centrally acting muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine showed amnesia, with a step-down latency of 16.8 ± 6.4 s (n = 19) in the test session. This amnesia was reverted by pre-treatment with the potent cholinesterase inhibitor THA (1) (5.6 mg/kg), and animals remained on the platform for 67.5 ± 13.9 s (n = 13). Compound 9 (1 mg/kg) was able to revert the amnesia induced by scopolamine, and the observed step-down latency was 41.6 ± 10.9 s (n = 13) (p < 0.05). Mice treated with compound 7 also showed increased step-down latency, but the eﬀect did not reach signiﬁcance at the dose tested (1 mg/kg; Table 2). In the spatial memory test (water maze), in the fourth day of test, control animals were able to localize the hid- den platform after 42.3 ± 13.2 s (n = 10), and this ability was disrupted by scopolamine. Treated animals could not remember the position of the platform, showing an escape latency of 115.8 ± 17.2 s (n = 8; maximum time: 150 s). Scopolamine-induced amnesia was antago- nized by pre-treatment with THA (1) and compound 7, and rats had an escape latency of 5.5 ± 4.5 s (n = 4) and 32.2 ± 6.3 s (n = 4), respectively (p < 0.001) (Table 2). Therefore, compound 7 and 9 are eﬀective in antagoni- zing the amnesia-induced by scopolamine in the water maze and passive-avoidance test, respectively, suggest- ing that these compounds also act as potent AChE inhibitors in tests in vivo. Interestingly, none of the animals treated with com- pound 7 or 9 (up to 10 mg/kg in mice) showed choliner- gic side eﬀects like tremor, salivation, diarrhea, or lacrimation. However, we observed diarrhea in 70% of rats and mice treated with THA (1 and 5.6 mg/kg), 15 min after the administration. THA (1) in concentra- tions of 30 and 50 mg/kg (up to 10 times the concentra- tion eﬀective in reversing the amnesia in mice) also produced splayed hindlimbs and lacrimation in 100% of mice, with moderate to severe tremor and salivation, after 30 min of administration. We also found that THA (1) (30 mg/kg) was lethal to 60% of mice, showing a nar- row therapeutic window. 3. Conclusion Our results show that semi-synthetic piperidine alka- loids designed from natural spectaline, such as com- pounds 7 and 9, act as cholinesterase inhibitors in vivo with a signiﬁcant selectivity toward brain acetylcholines- terase. Whether such selectivity is a desirable property in AD has been a matter of considerable debate, because of the evidence of a possible role of BuChE, particularly in late stages of the disease.3 However, recent pre-clinical studies support the earlier belief that AChE-selective inhibitors produce less peripheral side eﬀects.18 The compounds described herein, which can be eﬃciently prepared from abundant plant material, seem worth developing as candidate drugs for treating patients with Alzheimer�s disease. 4. Experimental 4.1. Chemistry Melting points were determined with a Microquimica MQAPF-301 apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were determined in dimethylsulfox- ide-d6 and methanol-d4 with a Varian INOVA 500 spec- trometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively. Splitting patterns were as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; dq, double quadruplet; br, broad; m, multiplet. 1H and 13C NMR assignments were conﬁrmed by gHMQC, gCOSY, and gHMBC experiments. IR spectra were ob- tained with a Nicolet-1400 FTIR spectrometer using KBr pellets. Prior to concentration under reduced pres- sure, all organic extracts were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate powder. The progress of all reactions was monitored by TLC performed on 2.0 · 6.0 alumi- num sheets precoated with neutral aluminum oxide (HF-254, Merck) to a thickness of 0.25 mm. The devel- oped chromatograms were viewed by spraying with iodo- chloroplatinate reagent (Merck). For column chromatography Merck neutral aluminum oxide (70– 230 mesh) was used. Solvents used in the reactions were dried, redistilled prior to use, and stored over +3�4 A˚ molecular sieves. Reaction mixtures were generally stir- red under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. 4.2.

One-pot preparation of acetyl hydrochloride 7 from natural spectaline (6). Compound 6 (0.44 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of AcOEt and then, 0.6 mL of 4188 C. Viegas, Jr. et al. / Bioorg. Med. Chem. 13 (2005) 4184–4190 concentrated HCl were added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated, the hydrochloride formed was dried under vacuum and dissolved in 8 mL of CHCl3. An excess of acetyl chloride was added, and the reaction was kept at 60 �C overnight. The reaction mixture was concen- trated, furnishing the acetyl hydrochloride 7 in 95% yield. 4.4. Pharmacology 4.4.1. Cholinesterase activity assays. Ellman�s colorimet- ric method9 was adapted for determination of total cho- linesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities in rat brain homogenates. Brain tissue from adult Wistar rats was homogenized at 8% w/v (or 40%, for butyrylcholin- esterase) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buﬀer, pH 7.4, with added NaCl 58.5 g/L and Triton X-100 0.05% v/v. Ali- quots of homogenate (5–20 lL) were incubated with anti-cholinesterase compounds for 10 min in phosphate buﬀer pH 7.4 before addition of 5,50-dithiobis(2-nitro- benzoic) acid and either acetylthiocholine iodide or butyrylthiocholine iodide (0.5 or 10 mM ﬁnal, respec- tively). The reaction was run at room temperature (22– 25 �C) in a ﬁnal volume of 200 lL in 96-well microplates and was followed at 412 nm for 5 min with a plate reader (SpectraMAX 250, Molecular Devices, USA). In every experiment, cholinesterase-independent (nonspe- ciﬁc) substrate hydrolysis was determined by including one experimental group treated with THA 20 lM; appropriate tissue and reagent blanks were also included. Reaction velocities were determined in three repli- cates per condition; these were averaged and expressed as percent activity relative to control (solvent), after sub- tracting the rate of nonspeciﬁc hydrolysis. All com- pounds were tested in nine concentrations from 0.5 to 200 lM. The IC50 based on a single-site model was determined by nonlinear regression. Results are re- ported as mean ± SEM of IC50 obtained independently from 2 to 4 animals. 4.5. Behavioral studies 4.5.1. Animals and drugs. The study was performed on 80 adult male Swiss albino mice (25–30 g), and 30 adult three-month old Wistar rats (200–250 g) for the passive avoidance and water maze tests, respectively. Animals were obtained from our facility center following ap- proved guidelines for animal care. Animals were allowed to acclimate to the behavioral experimental room for at least four days before procedures began, in a tempera- ture-controlled environment (20 ± 2 �C), relative humid- ity, with lights on from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. (12 h-diurnal light/12 h-dark cycles) and ad libitum access to food and water, 15 per cage for mice and 4 per cage for rats. Injection volumes were 10 mL/kg for mice and 1 mL/kg for rats. THA and (�)-scopolamine hydrobromide were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Saint Louis, MO). 4.5.2. Passive-avoidance test. The methods used were a modiﬁcation of those outlined by Cumin et al.16 Brieﬂy, in the ﬁrst day of testing, mice were individually trans- ferred from plastic cages to the passive avoidance box (20 · 20 cm), where they could freely explore it during 10 s and immediately removed to the cage (acclimation session). After 24 h, animals were injected ip with saline, THA (5.6 mg/kg), compound 7 (1 mg/kg), or compound 9 (1 mg/kg), and after 15 min, saline or scopolamine (1 mg/kg) was injected ip. After 30 min of the scopol- amine administration, animals were placed at a wooden platform (4 · 4 · 4 cm) inside the passive avoidance box, and the step-down latency computed when touching a grid ﬂoor with their four paws and receiving an aversive stimulus, an electric shock of 0.6 mA/3 s. This session was called training session, and the animals, which had shown a step-down latency superior to 15 s were not included in the experiment. After 24 h of the training session, the pharmacological procedure was repeated with selected mice, and the step-down latency once more obtained (test session). 4.5.3. Spatial memory test. Spatial memory in rats was assessed using an adaptation of the Morris water maze,17 carried out in the same behavioral room in which the rats were acclimated under the conditions of temperature, humidity, and light cycle described above. A circular pool (180 cm in diameter, 50 cm high) was ﬁlled to a depth of 30 cm with opaque water at a temper- ature of 20 ± 2 �C, and divided into four quadrants of equal area. A platform with 8 cm diameter was placed 1 cm below the water surface, midway between the cen- ter and the rim of the pool in one of the quadrants. The rat was placed into the pool facing the rim, and its es- cape latency, time taken by the rat to ﬁnd the platform, measured by an observer. If the rat failed to ﬁnd it with- in 150 s, the animal was placed on the platform for 20 s and then removed from the pool. The rat was given two trials a day for four days with an inter-trial interval of 15 min. The location of the escape platform remained unchanged, but the point of entry of the rat into the pool was diﬀerent on each day. During the four days of spatial memory testing, rats were injected ip with sal- ine, THA (1 mg/kg), compound 7 (1 mg/kg), or com- pound 9 (1 mg/kg), and after 15 min, were treated ip with saline or scopolamine (1 mg/kg). After 30 min of the last ip injection, animals were challenged to localize a hidden escape platform (ﬁrst trial). 4.5.4. Evaluation of cholinergic side eﬀects and toxicity. THA (1), compound 7, or compound 9 was injected ip in doses up to 10 times higher than those capable of reversing the amnesia in rodents in our study. Animals were placed in novel individual cages, and the presence or absence of signs of cholinergic hyperactivity was ob- served 10, 30, and 60 min after injection of the cholin- esterase inhibitors. At these times, the intensity of whole body tremor and salivation was scored from 0 to 3 (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe). Splayed hindlimbs, diarrhea, and lacrimation were evaluated as percentage of animals showing those symptoms. 4.5.5. Statistical analysis. Results were expressed as mean ± SEM and diﬀerences in means were estimated using ANOVA followed by Dunnet�s post-hoc test. Re- sults were considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. C.
