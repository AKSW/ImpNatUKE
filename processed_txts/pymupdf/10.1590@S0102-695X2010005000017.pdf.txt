706 RESUMO: “Atividade antimicrobiana de Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, contra fungos  oportunistas”. No contexto de nossas pesquisas por novos agentes antifúngicos obtidos da flora  brasileira, oito extratos e doze frações de Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, foram submetidos ao  ensaio antifúngico pelo método de microdiluição, contra quatro espécies de fungos oportunistas,  Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis e Cryptococcus neoformans. Este trabalho  revelou que os extratos e frações de P. nitens foram mais ativos contra C. krusei e C. parapsilosis  quando comparados a C. neoformans, sendo que o crescimento de C. albicans foi moderadamente  afetado por todos os extratos e frações. As atividades mais potentes foram observadas para  as frações n-butanólica dos galhos (CIM = 15,6 µg/mL) e raízes (CIM = 31,2 µg/mL) contra  C. krusei. Adicionalmente, a fração n-butanólica dos galhos foi submetida ao fracionamento  cromatográfico, resultando no isolamento de quatro alcaloides guanidínicos, sendo N-1,N-2,N-3-tri- isopentenilguanidina (1), descrito pela primeira vez em espécies da família Fabaceae e nitensidinas  A-C (2-4), os quais apresentaram atividade antifúngica moderada contra C. krusei (CIM = 62,5 µg/ mL) e C. parapsilosis (CIM = 31,2 µg/mL). Unitermos: Pterogyne nitens, alcaloides guanidínicos, antifúngico, fungos oportunistas, Candida  spp., Cryptococcus neoformans. ABSTRACT: As part of our ongoing research on antifungal agents from Brazilian flora, eight  extracts and twelve fractions from Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were screened for antimicrobial  activity against four opportunistic fungi species (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida  parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans) using a broth microdilution method. The present  investigation reveals that P. nitens extracts and fractions were more effective against C. krusei and  C. parapsilosis than against C. neoformans. The growth of C. albicans was moderately affected  by all tested extracts and fractions. The strongest effects were observed for n-butanol fractions  from branches (MIC = 15.6 µg/mL) and roots (MIC = 31.2 µg/mL) against C. krusei. Additionally,  the chromatographic fractionation of the n-butanol fraction from branches afforded four guanidine  alkaloids; N-1,N-2,N-3-triisopentenylguanidine (1), described for the first time in the Fabaceae  family, and nitensidines A-C (2-4), which showed moderate activity towards C. krusei (MIC = 62.5  µg/mL) and C. parapsilosis (MIC = 31.2 µg/mL). Keywords: Pterogyne nitens, guanidine alkaloids, antifungal, opportunistic fungi, Candida spp.,  Cryptococcus neoformans.

INTRODUCTION   The clinical relevance of opportunistic fungal  infections have increased at an alarming rate in the second  half of the twentyth century, including individuals infected  with HIV, transplant recipients and patients with cancer  (Clark & Hajjeh, 2002; Hage et al., 2002). The most  frequent causing agents of such infections are Candida,  Aspergillus species, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor  and some unusual genera such as Fusarium, Trichosporon,  707 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn.  Braz. J. Pharmacogn.  20(5): Out./Nov. 2010  Antimicrobial activity of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, against opportunistic fungi and Scedosporium (Guarro et al., 2006; Nucci & Anaissie,  2007). Furthermore, the most common treatment for these  infectious diseases involves azoles and polyene macrolides,  which are limited in their spectrum, and presenting severe  side effects (Helmerhorst et al., 1999). For this reason,  there is a need for new antifungal compounds which  can serve as lead compounds for further development in  antifungal chemotherapy. In this way, plants have been  proven to be a rich source of antimicrobial agents (Vieira et  al., 2005, Alves et al., 2006; Dias et al., 2006; Sena Filho et  al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2007; Batista-Júnior et al., 2008;  Cardoso-Lopes et al., 2008; Lopes et al., 2008; Tempone et  al., 2008; Bertucci et al., 2009; Costa et al., 2009; Regasini  et al., 2009a; Silva-Júnior et al., 2009).   Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, is popularly  named in South America as “tipa”, “yvi-raró”, “cocal”,  “amendoinzeiro”, “bálsamo” and “amendoim-bravo”  according to the region where this plant grows. It is a  sole beautiful legume tree from Pterogyne genus, which  is distributed mainly in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and  Argentina, reaching 5-12 m height (Burkart, 1952; Lorenzi,  1998). Cold aqueous preparations using stem barks has been  used as folk medicine for treating of ascaridiasis (Crivos,  2007). Previous chemical and biological studies have  demonstrated the presence of guanidine alkaloids, which  exhibited cytotoxic activity against to human cancer cell  lines (Bolzani et al., 1995; Ferreira et al., 2009; Regasini  et al., 2007, 2009b,c) and phenolics with myeloperoxidase  inhibitory and radical scavenging activities (Fernandes et  al., 2008; Regasini et al., 2008a,b,c; Souza et al., 2009;  Souza et al., 2010).   Thus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate  the antimicrobial activity of extracts and fractions from  branches, green fruits, roots and stem barks and isolated  terpene guanidine alkaloids from P. nitens against four  opportunistic human yeasts (Candida albicans, C. krusei,  C. parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans), by using  broth microdilution test. MATERIAL AND METHODS Plant material   Roots, branches, green fruits and stem barks of  Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, were collected in the  Botanic Garden of São Paulo (São Paulo, Brazil) by Ph.D.  Maria C. M. Young in January 2005 and identified by  Ph.D. Inês Cordeiro (IBt-SMA). A voucher specimen (SP  204319b) was deposited at the State Herbarium "Maria  Eneida Kaufmann" of Institute of Botany (São Paulo,  Brazil). Extraction   The powdered shade-dried plant material was  extracted three times (72 h) by maceration with hexane  and, subsequently with ethanol. The solvent was removed  under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation yielding  a thick syrup. The crude ethanol extracts were further  reconstituted in methanol-water (7:3) and then partitioned  with ethyl acetate and n-butanol, successively. Samples  from hexane and ethanol extracts, ethyl acetate, n-butanol  and lyophilized hydroalcoholic fractions, were submitted  to antimicrobial tests. Isolation of antifungal compounds 1-4   The n-butanol fraction (2.5 g) from the ethanol  extract of branches was subjected to gel permeation  column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20, eluted  with methanol to afford nine fractions (B1-B9), which  were combined after comparison of their TLC profile  [chloroform:methanol (9:1)] revealed with Dragendorff´s  reagent. The alkaloidal fraction (B2, 587 mg) was  subjected to reversed-phase C-18 silica gel CC eluted with  acetonitrile:water gradient that afforded eight fractions  (ALK1-ALK8). Purification of fraction ALK5 (121 mg)  by repeated CC over silica gel (230-400 mesh) eluted with  chloroform:methanol in a gradient ranging from 0 to 35%  methanol, furnished N-1,N-2,N-3-triisopentenylguanidine  (1, 7 mg) and nitensidine B (3, 12 mg). Fraction ALK-8  (88 mg) was subject to preparative TLC developed with ch loroform:methanol:triethylamine (87:12.5:0.5), developed  three times to yield nitensidine A (2, 7 mg) and nitensidine  C (4, 3 mg).    The molecular structures of these guanidine  alkaloids were identified through 1H NMR, 13C NMR and  MS data. The spectral data were in agreement with those  published in the literature (Bolzani et al., 1995; Conegero  et al., 2003). N N N H H N H H N NH N H N NH H N Me Me N NH 1 2 3 4 708 Rev. Bras.

Microorganisms and growth conditions   The test organisms C. albicans ATCC 90028, C.  krusei ATCC 6258, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 and C.  neoformans ATCC 90012 were originally obtained from  the Mycology Laboratory of the Department of Clinical  Analysis, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at São Paulo  State University (UNESP). The yeasts were grown and  maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 to 48 h at  room temperature. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing   The antifungal activity tests were performed  using broth microdilution method as described in the  M27-A2 document of Clinical and Laboratory Standards  Institute  (CLSI)  with  modifications  (Rodriguez- Tudela et al., 2003). The medium used was RPMI 1640  with L-glutamine buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165 M  morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), supplemented  with 2% glucose. Samples were diluted in DMSO and each  well of a 96-well U-bottomed culture plate were added 100  µL culture together with 100 µL of 2-fold serial diluted test  compound. The cell suspension was prepared in 0.85%  saline with an optical density equivalent to McFarland  0.5 and diluted 1:100 in RPMI for the final concentration  to be 1 x 105 to 5 x 105 CFU/mL. This suspension was  inoculated on the microdilution plate previously prepared  with the extracts, fractions and compounds 1-4 diluted  at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 µg/mL. The  plates were incubated with agitation at 37 °C for 24 h for  Candida spp. and 48 h for C. neoformans. Amphotericin B  and fluconazole were used as positive controls exhibiting  a MIC value ranging from 2.00 to 0.06 and 64.00 to 2.00  µg/mL (Table 1).   The MIC values were calculated as the lowest  concentration of the test samples which shows complete  growth inhibition of the fungi strains. Results were  analyzed visually and spectrophotometrically. All assays  were performed in triplicate. The extracts and fractions  showing a MIC lower than 100, ranging from 100-500,  500-1000 and over 1000 µg/mL were considered potent,  moderated, weak and not active, respectively (Holetz et  al., 2002). Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC)   All tested samples in antifungal study showing  MIC<1000 µg/mL, were transferred to plates of Sabouraud- dextrose agar. The plates were incubated at 35 oC for 48 h  (yeast). The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration  of the extract that did not permit any visible fungal colony  growth on the appropriate agar plate after the period of  incubation. All assays were performed in triplicate. RESULTS   In this work, eight extracts and twelve fractions  as well as four guanidine alkaloids (1-4) were tested at  concentrations ranging from 1000 to 0.48 µg/mL against  four human opportunistic yeasts (C. albicans, C. krusei,  C. parapsilosis and C. neoformans). These results were  summarized in Table 1.   All extracts and fractions from Pterogyne nitens  Tul., Fabaceae, were weakly active against the yeast C.  albicans with MIC values ranging from 1000 to 250 µg/ mL, which were considered moderate to weak according  to Holetz et al. (2002). The hexane extract from roots was  not active to C. albicans and C. neoformans (MIC>1000  µg/mL). The extracts and fractions from roots and green  fruits demonstrated moderate activity against C. krusei,  except the n-butanol fraction from roots, which presented  strong activity (MIC 31.2 µg/mL) against this yeast.  Additionally, branches and stem barks exhibited potent  activity against C. krusei with MIC values ranging from  15.6 to 62.5 µg/mL and the best result was observed for  the n-butanol fraction from branches (MIC = 15.6 µg/ mL). Furthermore the hexane extracts and hydroalcoholic  fractions from branches and stem barks showed moderate  to weak activity against this yeast. All the samples had  weak to moderate activity against C. parapsilosis and C.  neoformans, except for the ethanol extract, ethyl acetate,  and n-butanol fractions from stem barks, which exhibited  potent inhibition of C. parapsilosis (MIC = 62.5 µg/mL).   Compounds  1-4  isolated  from  n-butanol  fraction of branches from P. nitens inhibits the growth of  opportunistic fungi with MIC values of 62.5 and 31.2 μg/ mL against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, respectively.   Additionally, minimal fungicidal concentration  (MFC) of all extracts, fractions and guanidine alkaloids  (1-4) were also evaluated against the four yeasts and  showed MFC values higher than 1000 µg/mL, indicating a  fungistatic behavior. DISCUSSION   Several Fabaceae species have been evaluated  for their antifungal properties (Scorzoni et al., 2007)  among them Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, a typical  leguminous plant from Brazilian flora has been studied  for antimicrobial activity. Previous biological studies have  demonstrated that extracts from the barks of P. nitens did  not show antibacterial activity (Salvat et al., 2001).   The bioactivity presented for compounds 1-4  indicated that antifungal activity observed in the extracts  and fractions may be at least partially due to guanidine  alkaloids. It was also observed that the strongest antifungal  effects of the tested samples were on strains of C. krusei  and C. parapsilosis when compared with C. albicans and  C. neoformans.   P. nitens and isolated compounds displayed  709 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn.  Braz. J. Pharmacogn.  20(5): Out./Nov. 2010  Antimicrobial activity of Pterogyne nitens Tul., Fabaceae, against opportunistic fungi activity against C. krusei, which is very significant because  this yeast has natural resistance against commercial drug  fluconazole (Rex et al., 1995), suggesting its potential  application for treating C. krusei infections, considering a  possible mode of action different from those azole drugs.   The current study suggests that P. nitens have  antimicrobial activity against opportunistic yeasts.  Therefore, it could be an important source of antifungal  compounds which can be useful for developing new lead  compounds, including compound 1, which was described  for the first time in the Fabaceae family. Further chemical  and pharmacological investigations are thus needed in  order to isolate and identify additional constituents and  establish the potential mechanisms of action.
