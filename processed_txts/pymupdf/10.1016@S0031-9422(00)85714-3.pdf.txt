Plant. Rheedia gara!neriana PI. k Tr., trivial name “bacupari”, family Guttiferae.  Source. Dois Irmlos forest, Recife, Pernambuco State, Brazil.  Bark. The benzene extract (155 g, 5 %) was chromatographed  on a silica column. From  fractions eluted with benzene-CHCl,  crystallized lupeol (10 g), and from fractions eluted  with CHCl, crystallized betulin (30 mg).  Wood.  The benzene extract (57 g, 0.7%) was chromatographed  on a silica column.  The fraction eluted with CHC& was crystallized from EtOH. First crop: Aliphatic ester,  m.p. 80-83” (184 mg); second crop: @itosterol  (1 g). The residue of the mother-liquor  was chromatographed  on a silica column. Elution with benxene-CHCI 3 (1: 1) produced a  fraction which was crystallized from CHCl,-light  petroleum, affording l &dihydroxy-5-  methoxyxanthone  (30 mg) (buchanaxanthone),  isolated previously from Garcinia buchananii  Baker2 and CalophylIum fragrans Ridley.3 The residue of the mother-liquor was crystallized  from EtOH yielding 1,5-dihydroxyxanthone  (10 mg) isolated previously from G. buchananii  Baker,2 Mammea americana L.,4 M. africana G. Don’ and Mesua ferrea L.6 Elution with  chloroform produced 1,7-dihydroxyxanthone  (9 mg) (euxanthone), widespread in Guttiferae  species.’  All substances were identified by direct comparison (co-chromatography,  mixed m.p.,  U.V. and i.r. spectra) with authentic samples.2s8  Acknowledgements-The authors wish to thank the Fund@0  de Amparo a Pesquisa do E&do de Spa  Paul0 for flnaneial support, Dr. Gerald0 Mariz, Universidade Federal de Pemambuco, for the collection ad  the classifkation of the plant, Dr. F.
