Abstract-An  investigation  of three species of burner,  R. u~e~lata, R. lanc~~~u and R. guyuuensis, has led to the  identification  of three terpeno-~-hydroxy~nzoic  acids, 3-geranyl-4-hydroxy-5~~,~-~methyl~lyl)-~nzoi~  acid;  S-carboxy-7-(3”,3”-dimethylallyl)-2-(l’-hydroxy-l’,5’-dimethylhex-4’-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenan  and 6-carboxy&  (3”,3”-dimethyiaUy1)-3a-hydroxy-2a-methy1-2-~~-methy1~n~-3‘-eny1)-3,4-dihydrobenzop~an  and two triterpenoids  which appear to be novel. The two new compounds were identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis as 24(E) -3-  oxo-dammara-2~,2~dien-26-~  and 2qE)-3a-hydroxycy~lo~-24-en-26-~.  IhTRODWCTION  The family Myrsina~ae  has usually been considered to  contain about 33 genera and nearly 1000 species. This  plant family is characterized by the presence of a group of  3,6-dihydroxy-2-alkylbenzoquinones  and a number  of  triterpenoids  based on the oleananeiursane  skeleton  [l-5].  However, many of the species are little known  chemically.  Recently, we have described the isolation and identi-  fication  of 3-geranyl-4-hydroxy-5-(3”,3”-dimethylallyl)-  benzoic  acid,  S-carboxy-7-(3”,3”-dimethylallyl)-2-  (l’-hydroxy-1’,5’-dimethylhex-4’=enyl)-2,3-dihydro-  benzofuran  and  6-~boxy-8-(~‘,~~imethyl~lyl)-3a~  hydroxy-2a-me~yl-2-(~-methyl~nt-~-~yl~3,~dihy-  drobenzopyran  from the dichloromethane  extract of the  leaves of Myrsinaceae  species Rapanea umbeilata Mez.  (syn. Myrsine umbellata Mart.) [6]. The three acids were  purified as their methyl esters. These compounds  re-  presented a novel group of ter~no-p-hydroxy~nzoic  acids.  The isolation of this interesting  group of new com-  pounds combined  with our taxonomic  interest in the  Myrsinaceae stimulated an investigation of other organs  of R. umbellata and other plants of the Rapanea genus, i.e.  R. l~c~lia  Mez. (syn. Myrsine ~~c~~ia  Mart) and  R. ~uya~~is  Albi. (syn. ~yrsi~  ~uya~~is  Kuntze).  Two new triterpenoids  (I, 2) have now been isolated  along with three known terpeno-phydroxybenzoic  acids  C61.  BESUL’IS AND DISCUSSION  In a continuation  of our investigation  of the leaves of  R. umbellata, we have isolated from the petrol extract a  single triterpenoid  derivative (1).  Compound  1, C30H4602 (MS), gave rise to an IR  spectrum which indicated  the presence of a terminal  methylene (888 cm-“), a carbonyl (1707 cm-‘) and an  a&unsaturated  carbonyl  (X653 cm-‘)  as functional  groups. ‘H NMR spectrum flable 1) showed signals for a  -CHO group, a vinylic methyl and three olefinic protons,  one of which was deshielded, typical of the p position on  an a&unsaturated  aldehyde. A significant fragment at  m/z 315 [CZZH3JOJ” for the tetracyclic nucleus required  the presence of the terminal  methylene  at C-21 and  -CHO at C-26 or C-27 of the C-17 sidechain. This was  corroborated  by the fragment m/z 123 [C,H,,O]+.  It is  well known that the signal of a &olefinic proton cis (66.4)  to the aldehyde group is significantly more deshielded  than the trans (66.1) [7]. Therefore, the downfield shift of  the signal of the fl-oletiic  proton in the ‘H NMR spec-  trum clearly suggested the E-configuration  of the double  bond. The ident~cation  of the nucleus as a dammarane  was supported by the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) which  agreed closely with published data for cabraleone (3) and  dammaradienol(4)  [8,9]. The signal of the C-27 methyl  (6 10.0) supported the E-configuration  of the double bond  as it is shielded by the steric interaction  with the C-23  methylene [lo]. The new natural product is, therefore,  24(E)-3-oxodammara-20,24-dien-26-al  (1).  The dichloromethane  extract of the stem and fruits  of R. umbellata and leaves of R. lancifolia, gave 3-  geranyl-4-hydroxy-S-(3”,3’‘-dimethylallyl)-~nzoic  acid  and  5-carboxy-7~~,3”-~methylallyl)-2-(l’-hydroxy-  l’,S-dimethylhex-~-enyl)-2,3-dihydro~~ofuran.  The  two acids were methylated with diazomethane  prior to  anaIysis. They were identified by comparison with auth-  entic samples and published data [6].  From the petrol extract of the leaves of R. guy~nensjs,  four #mpounds  were obtained. Three were characterized  as S-~rboxy-7~~‘,~-dimethylallyl~2-(  l’-hydroxy- l’,S’-  dimethyIhex-4’-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran  and  6-  carboxy-8-(3”,3”-dimethylallyl)-3a-hydroxy-2a-me~hyl-  2-(4’-methylpent-3’-enyl)-3,4_dihydrobenzopyran  and  phytol by comparison with published data and authentic  samples [6, 11-j.  The fourth compound (2) showed the spectral charac-  teristics of a viny& methyl and a trans a&unsaturated  1251  1252  A. H. JANU~~RIO et al.

In addition,  the ‘H NMR  showed  signals  for a secondary  hydroxyl  (63.45, br s,  H-3/?) and  a cyclopropane  methylene  (Table  1). The  ’ 3C NMR spectrum (Table 2) revealed resonances  for C-l  to C-22 in close agreement  with those for isomangiferolic  acid (5) [lo],  while signals for two olefinic carbons  at  S 139.1 and 155.6, -CHO  at 6 195.4 and methyl at 69.10  confirmed  the presence of the trans a&unsaturated  alde-  hyde. The mass spectrum  gave significant  fragments  for  m/r 315 [CZZH350]+  and 125 [CsH130]+  requiring  the  presence  of -CH=CMeCHO  in the sidechain.  The struc-  ture of the new natural  product  is therefore  24(E)-3~  hydroxycycloart-24-en-26-al  (2). The corresponding  C-3  epimer (63.23,3a-H;  66.47, H-24) has been reported  from  Mung@-a  indica, Anacardiaceae  [ 121.  2  CHO  5  C&H  If the same enzymes catalyse allylic oxidation  in both  triterpenoids  1 and 2, some connection  between R. umhel-  lata and R. guyanensis can be anticipated.  This appears to  be the first record of dammarane/cycloartane  triterpen-  oids from the Myrsinaceae.  We do not know how widely  the characteristic  Rapanea compounds  occur elsewhere in  the family  as many  of the species  are little known  chemically. It is, therefore, premature  to draw any conclu-  sions about  the link among  Rapanea  and its supposed  allies in the Myrsinaceae.

Extraction and isohon  from leaves of R. umbellata.  Ground  leaves (235 g) were extracted  with petrol.  The petrol  extract  (4.4 g) was subjected  to CC over slhca gel eluting with hexane,  then  hexane  containing  increasing  amounts  of CH,Cl,  and  finally with EtOAc to give a mixture of fatty acids followed by a  fraction  which was rechromatographed  as above,  to afford  a  fraction contalmng  l(5 mg). The latter was then purified by prep.  TLC on sdica gel using a soln of CH,CI,-EtOAc  (19 : 1).  Extraction and isolation from stem of R. umbellata.  Ground  stem (652 g) was extracted  with CH,CI,.  The CH,Cl,  extract  (6 6 g) was subjected  to CC over silica gel eluting with CH,Cl,  containing  increasing  amounts  of EtOAc to give more fatty acids  followed  by 2 fractions  which  were methylated  with CH,N,  yielding  the  corresponding  methyl  esters.  Both  fractions  were  chromatographed  as  above,  to  afford  3-geranyl-4-  hydroxy-5-(3”,3’‘-dimethylallyl)-benzoic  acid  methyl  ester  (133 mg)  and  ?-carbomethoxy-7-(3”,3’‘-dimethylallyl)-2-  (l’-hydroxy-1’,5’-dimethylhex-4’-enyl)-2,3-dihydro~nzofuran  (385 mg), respectively.  Extraction and isolation from fruits of R. umbellata.  Ground  frmts  (662 mg) were  extracted  with  CH,Cl,  to give 4.2g  Triterpenoids  from three Rapanea species  1253  Table  2. ‘%NMR  spectral  data for compounds  1 and 2 and  the model compounds  %S  C  1  3  4  2  5  1  40.0  40.0  39.2  27.5  27.4  2  32.1  34.1  27.5  28.5  28.5  3  218.0  218.0  78.9  77.0  77.1  4  48.4  41.4  39.0  39.5  39.5  5  55.4  55.4  55.9  41.0  41.1  6  19.9  19.7  18.3  21.1  21.0  7  34.7  34.7  35.5  28.2  28.1  8  40.4  40.4  40.5  48.0  48.0  9  50.2  50.2  51.0  19.8  19.8  10  36.9  36.9  37.3  26.4  26.4  11  21.9  23.4  21.4  26.2  26.2  12  25.0  25.8  25.0  32.8  32.9  13  45.5  43.4  45.3  45.3  45.3  14  49.4  50.0  49.5  48.9  48.9  15  31.3  31.5  31.4  35.4  35.5  16  27.6  27.8  27.1  26.0  25.9  17  47.4  49.8  47.8  52.1  52.1  18  16.1  16.1  16.0  19.3  19.3  19  15.4  15.2  15.7  29.7  29.8  20  151.1  86.4  152.7  35.9  35.9  21  108.4  24.1  107.6  18.1  18.0  22  32.7  34.9  34.1  34.1  34.8  23  29.7  27.1  28.9  25.6  21.0  24  154.4  86.5  124.5  155.6  145.7  25  139.0  70.3  131.4  139.1  126.7  26  195.3  26.4  25.7  195.4  173.0  27  10.0  26.8  17.7  9.1  11.9  28  26.1  27.2  28.1  18.1  18.1  29  21.0  21.0  15.4  21.2  21.2  30  15.8  16.3  16.3  25.8  25.8  of extract.
