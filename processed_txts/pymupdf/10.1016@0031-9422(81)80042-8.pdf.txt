Abstract-Analysis  of the petrol-diethyl  ether extracts of Pterocaulon balansae and P. lanatum aerial parts afforded,  besides puberulin, scopoletin- [2’,3’-dihydroxy-3’-methylbutyl-(  1 ‘)]ether, scopoletin- [2’,3’-epoxy-3’-methylbutyl-(1 ‘)I  ether and 7-(3-methyl-2,3-epoxybutyloxy)-5,6-methylenedioxycoumarin,  four new related coumarins. The isolation of  these coumarins may constitute a valid index for the chemotaxonomic  characterization  of genus.  INTRODUCTION  The genus Pterocaulon has 25-30 species. P. balansae  Chodat. and P. lanatum 0. Kuntze subshrubby  plants  from the Compositae family occur almost exclusively in  the central part of the South America [l]. P. balansae  species is very easily confused with P. alopecuroides  (Lam.) DC a synonym of Conyza alopecuroides Lam. [ 11.  Some ConVza species afford coumarin compounds  [2] as  well as P. sphacelatum Benth & Hook  [3], the only  Pterocaulon  species  already  studied.  The  present  communication  deals  with  the  isolation  of eight  coumarins  from the aerial parts of P. balansae and P.  lanatum.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The petrol-Et,0  extracts from the aerial parts of the  plants on chromatography  yielded substances 1 to 8.1,2  and 3 are common to both plants, 1 and 6 were first  isolated from Pteronia glabrata L.f. and P. ciliata Thunb.  respectively [4], 3 and 5 from Conyza obscura DC [2].  Compound 2, a new isomer of sabandinol  (9) [5], was  elucidated on the basis of spectral data and confirmed by  acidic epoxide cleavage of 1.  Of  the  remaining  three  compounds,  those  of  composition C16H1s06 and C,,H,,O,  have UV spectra  essentially superimposable  on that of 6, leading to the  conclusion  that all three have the same oxygenation  pattern. ‘H NMR spectra ofboth substances show signals  for C-4 protons  at J 7.57 and  6 7.63 respectively,  suggesting the lack of an oxygenated function at C-5. By  running ‘H NMR spectrain both CDCl, and C,D, it was  possible to locate OMe groups at C-6 and C-8 [7]. These  data are in agreement  with the structures  4 and 8  respectively, which were proved by epoxidation  of 6  followed by acidic cleavage of the epoxide.  The last coumarin with composition C15H1405 must  have a methylene-dioxy  group and dimethylallyloxy  group which is evident from ‘H NMR analysis (Table 1)  through the peaks at 6 6.08 and b 4.93 respectively. The  only aromatic proton must be located at C-S since the C-4  Table 1. ‘H NMR data of compounds 2,4,7 and 8 (60 MHz, CDCI, and C,D,)  2*  4  7  8  CDCI,  CDCI,  C,D,  CDCI,  C,D,  CDCI,  C,D,  H-3  6.26 d  6.40 d  6.05 d  6.25 d  5.98 d  6.45 d  6.10 d  H-4  8.05 d  7.65 d  6.75 d  8.04 d  7.66 d  7.75 d  6.81 d  H-5  --  6.75 s  6.12 s  6.81 s  6.11 s  H-8  6.63 s  -  -  6.60 s  6.34 s  H-l’  4.40 dd (6, 11)  4.26 d  4.26 dd  4.93 br. d  4.15 d  4.1 m  4.1 m  4.63 dd (4, 11)  (6)  (6, 10)  (8)  (8)  H-2’  3.85m  3.25 t  3.20 m  5.48 br. t  5.48 m  3.8 m  3.8 m  (6)  (8)  Me-3’  1.26 s  1.28 s  1.05 s  1.76 s  1.53 s  1.26 s  1.20 s  1.33 s  1.37 s  1.11 s  1.80 s  1.62 s  1.30 s  1.30 s  0-CH,-0  6.09 s  6.08 s  5.17 s  MeO-6  -  3.94 s  3.66 s  3.98 s  3.23 s  NeO-8  4.09 s  3.54 s  4.15 s  3.99 s  *Saturated soln in C,D, too dilute for reliable assignments of weak signals: 6 scale.

MAGALHAES  et al.  proton resonates at 68.04 [6]. These data suggest two  possible structures (7 and 10)  from which we choose 7  because of the pronounced  diamagnetic  shift of the  methylenedioxy  protons (0.91 ppm) when the ‘H NMR  spectrum is recorded in CDCI, and C,D, (Table 1) [4].  EXPERIMENTAL  General methods. UV were run in EtOH; IR in KBr pellets:  IHNMR spectra at 6OMHz; MS at 70eV; mps are uncorr.;  column chromatography  and TLC were performed with Si gel.  The identity  of the known products  was established  by  comparison  of their physical data with those of authentic  samples. Plant materials were collected at the surroundings of  UNICAMP in July 1979, and the fresh aerial parts, ground,  percolated with petrol-Et,0  (1:2), coned under red. pres. at  room  temp.  and fractioned  by column  chromatography  (elution: hexane-CHCl,  and CHCl,-MeOH).
