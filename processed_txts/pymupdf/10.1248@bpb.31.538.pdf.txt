The ﬂagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologi- cal agent of Chagas disease, affects more than 18 million people in Latin America and is responsible for approximately 400000 deaths per year.1) Only two drugs are commercially available for the treatment of this disease, namely, nifurtimox (a 2-nitrofuran derivative) and benznidazole (a 2-nitroimida- zole acetamide). These drugs are, however, not consistently effective and, moreover, exhibit serious side effects including cardiac and/or renal toxicity.2) There is thus particular inter- est in the discovery of natural products that might be devel- oped to generate safer and more efﬁcient chemotherapeutic agents against T. cruzi.3) A number of biologically-active chromenes have been  isolated from species of the genus Piper, including the prenylated chromene 1 from Piper gaudichaudianum4) and chromenes 2—5 (Fig. 1) from P. aduncum.5) Whilst these chromenes have been shown to exhibit anti-fungal4) and anti- tumour properties,5) no evaluation has yet been made with  respect to their activity against T. cruzi. The object of the present study was to examine a range of natural chromenes and chromene derivatives in order to determine their poten- tial for further development to treat Chagas disease. METHODS AND RESULTS General All reagents were of analytical grade. For methylation reactions, an ethereal solution of diazomethane (30 ml) was prepared by dissolving 2.14 g of N-methyl-N-ni- troso-p-toluenesulphonamide (Diazald; Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) in 10.0 ml of ethanol containing 4.0% potassium hydroxide.6) Hydrogenation reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of hydrogen in the presence of palladium (3.0 or 10.0%) on activated charcoal (Acros Organics, New Jer- sey, U.S.A.) as catalyst.7) The acetylated chromene was pre- pared by treatment with acetic anhydride (20.0 ml) and pyri- dine (20.0 ml) overnight.8) Benznidazole, employed as posi- tive control in the assays of trypanocidal activity, was ob- tained from Roche (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Plant Material Specimens of P. gaudichaudianum and P. aduncum were cultivated from seed under greenhouse con- ditions at the Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara-SP, Brazil. Plant material was authenticated by Dr. Guillermo E. D. Paredes (Universidad Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Lambayeque, Peru) and voucher specimens (with codes Kato 0093 and 0057, respectively) were deposited at the Herbarium of the 538 Vol. 31, No. 3 Notes Natural Chromenes and Chromene Derivatives as Potential  Anti-trypanosomal Agents João Marcos BATISTA Jr.,a Adriana Aparecida LOPES,a Daniela Luz AMBRÓSIO,b Luis Octávio REGASINI,a Massuo Jorge KATO,c Vanderlan da Silva BOLZANI,a Regina Maria Barretto CICARELLI,b and Maysa FURLAN*,a a Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP); Prof. Francisco Degni, 14801–970, Araraquara, SP, Brazil: b Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP); Rodovia Araraquara/Jaú Km 1, 14801–902, Araraquara, SP, Brazil and c Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo; Av.

Received September 18, 2007; accepted December 6, 2007; published online December 13, 2007 The aim of the study was to investigate the anti-trypanocidal activities of natural chromene and chromene derivatives. Five chromenes were isolated from Piper gaudichaudianum and P. aduncum, and a further seven de- rivatives were prepared using standard reduction, methylation and acetylation procedures. These compounds were assayed in vitro against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The results showed that the most of the compounds, especially those possessing electron-donating groups as sub- stituents on the aromatic ring, showed potent trypanocidal activity. The most active compound, [(2S)-methyl-2- methyl-8-(3�-methylbut-2�-enyl)-2-(4�-methylpent-3�-enyl)-2H-chromene-6-carboxylate], was almost four times more potent than benznidazole (the positive control) and showed an IC50 of 2.82 mM. The results reveal that chromenes exhibit signiﬁcant anti-trypanocidal activities and indicate that this class of natural product should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas dis- ease.

Evaluation of Trypanocidal Activity Assays of the anti- parasitic activities of the isolates and their derivatives were conducted by screening their effects on the proliferation of epimastigotes of T. cruzi Y-strain grown in axenic culture in LIT medium. Stock solutions (containing 1.0 mg/ml) of the natural chromenes and their derivatives were prepared in di- methylsulphoxide and serially diluted (1 : 3) in liver infusion tryptose medium to yield sample solutions with concentra- tions of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 mg/ml. The number of remaining viable protozoa was established by counting in a Neubauer chamber following incubation at 28 °C for 72 h with the test sample. All assays were con- ducted in triplicate. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined by linear regression analysis. The IC50 values for compounds 1—12 and for benznidazole (em- March 2008 539 ployed as positive control) are shown in Table 1. For the sta- tistical analysis, method of probits was employed. DISCUSSION As part of an on-going screening program for new anti- chagasic drugs, the prenylated chromene [(2S)-2-methyl-8- (3�-methylbut-2�-enyl)-2-(4�-methylpent-3�-enyl)-2H- chromene-6-carboxylic acid] (1), the major metabolite of the ethanolic extract of Piper gaudichaudianum,4) was evaluated with respect to its toxicity against epimastigotes of T. cruzi and exhibited a dose-dependent effect with an IC50 value of 33.8 mM. On the basis of this ﬁnding, the natural benzopyrans 2—5 (isolated from P. aduncum) were assayed for trypanoci- dal activity together with some novel chromene derivatives obtained from 1, 3, 4 and 5 by simple chemical transforma- tions. Speciﬁcally, hydrogenation7) of the isoprene units and of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring of 1 produced the derivative 6. The benzopyran ester 7 was obtained from 1 by methylation with diazomethane,6) and this ester was subse- quently reduced to 8 by catalytic hydrogenation. Similarly, derivatives 9 and 10 were obtained from chromenes 3 and 4, respectively, whilst derivative 11 was obtained by selective hydrogenation of 5. Finally the chromene 4 was acetylated to 12. Most of the isolates together with their derivatives showed signiﬁcant trypanocidal activities in comparison with the positive control benznidazole (IC50 of 10.3 mM). Compound 7 proved to be the most active with an IC50 value of 2.82 mM, i.e. almost four times more potent than benznidazole. All compounds that showed activity possessed electron- donating substituents. Within this group the prenylated com- pounds 1, 5, 7 and 11 were the most active, whilst the ester derivative 7 (containing two prenyl units) was an extremely powerful trypanocidal agent with a potency ca. 10-fold greater than that of the corresponding acid. This ﬁnding sug- gests that both prenyl and ester substituents are necessary for the strongest anti-parasitic activity. The lower activity exhib- ited by chromene 2 compared with 3 corroborates the impor- tance of an ester group, and indicates a direct correlation be- tween the electronic nature of the substituents and trypanoci- dal activity. Moreover, the observed reduction in activity of 12 occasioned by the introduction of an electron-withdraw- ing acetyl group at C-8 following acetylation8) of 4, substan- tiates the inﬂuence of the electronic nature of the substituents (Table 1). Reduction of the double bonds of the prenyl substituents (as in derivatives 6 and 8) gave rise to a signiﬁcant decrease in toxicity indicating their essential role in trypanocidal ac- tivity. Furthermore, reduction of the double bond at C-3 of the pyran ring (as in derivatives 9 and 10) resulted in the total loss of toxicity suggesting that a double bond conjugated with the aromatic ring is essential for trypanocidal activity. These results suggest that substituents on the aromatic ring that contribute to an increase in lipophilicity are also re- quired for activity (Table 1). In conclusion, several natural chromenes from P. gau- dichaudianum and P. aduncum, along with a series of semi- synthetic derivatives, have been shown to exhibit potential trypanocidal activities against epimastigotes of T. cruzi. The results suggest that chromenes should be considered further in the development of new and more potent drugs for use in the treatment of Chagas disease.
