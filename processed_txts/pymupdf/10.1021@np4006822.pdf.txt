Additionally, four known polyketides, austdiol (1), eugenitin (3), 6-methoxyeugenin (6), and 9- hydroxyeugenin (7), were also isolated. The structural characterization of compounds was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy, time- dependent density functional theory calculations, and X-ray crystallography. Compounds 1−9 were weakly active when tested in antileishmanial and cytotoxicity assays. E ndophytic microorganisms live inside the tissues of host plants without apparently harming them and are a promising source of bioactive compounds.1−4 Species of Mycoleptodiscus, such as M. indicus, M. terrestris, and M. sphericus, are commonly isolated as endophytes; they are probably latently phytopathogenic and may become phytopa- thogenic when the host plant is subjected to stress.5 M. indicus, a tropical to subtropical species, occurs in leaves of diﬀerent host plants, mainly monocotyledons. M. indicus is associated with large spreading lesions on leaves of Zamia spp., an American cycad, and other monocotyledonous plants.6 M. indicus has occasionally been reported to infect humans and canines, causing septic arthritis and skin infections.7 In this paper, the isolation, structural characterization, and biological activity of secondary metabolites from cultures of M. indicus, an endophytic fungus isolated from the leaves from Borreria verticillata (Rubiaceae), are reported. Three new azaphilones, named mycoleptones A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5), were isolated and fully characterized; in addition, four known polyketides, namely, austdiol (1), eugenitin (3), 6-methox- yeugenin (6), and 9-hydroxyeugenin (7), were isolated and identiﬁed, and the acetylated derivatives of austdiol (8) and mycoleptone A (9) were synthesized (Figure 1). ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Seven secondary metabolites of M. indicus were isolated, four of which were identiﬁed as austdiol, eugenitin, 6-methoxyeugenin, and 9-hydroxyeugenin by comparison of experimental spectro- scopic data with literature values.8−13 Austdiol ((7R,8S)-7,8- dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-6-oxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-isochromene-5- carbaldehyde) is the main toxic component of a mixture of compounds produced in moldy maize meal by Aspergillus ustus and belongs to a class of compounds known generically as azaphilones.14,15 Azaphilones are yellow or orange pigments produced by fungi: their pyran oxygen atoms are easily exchanged to nitrogen atoms with ammonia, and the name is derived from the ready reaction of these metabolites with ammonia to yield vinylogous γ-pyridones.16 The skeleton of austdiol is derived from a single pentaketide chain, composed of Received: August 22, 2013 Published: January 3, 2014 Article pubs.acs.org/jnp © 2014 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy 70 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np4006822 | J. Nat. Prod. 2014, 77, 70−78 head-to-tail acetate units, and possesses two C1 units introduced from S-adenosylmethionine.17 A wide range of interesting biological activities of azaphilones, such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, cytotoxic, nematicidal, and anti-inﬂammatory, have been reported in the literature;14,17 their nonselective biological activities may be related to the production of vinylogous γ-pyridones.18 Three of the isolated metabolites are previously unreported azaphilones and were named mycoleptones A, B, and C (2, 4, and 5). Mycoleptone A (2) was isolated as a yellow powder, and the complete structural characterization was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high- resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy, time-dependent density func- tional theory (TD-DFT) calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction studies (Figure 2). The UV spectrum of 2 displays maximum absorptions at 254 nm (log ε 2.90) and 361 nm (log ε 2.83), revealing the presence of an extended conjugated system, characteristic of azaphilones. Compound 2 displays similar 1H and 13C NMR spectra to austdiol,8,9 with the replacement of the aldehyde signals (δH 9.99 and δC 189.3) by methylene signals (δH 3.26 and δC 18.5) at position C-5. The 1H NMR spectrum exhibits two signals at δH 7.30 and 6.25 due to hydrogen atoms on the pyran ring, two hydroxyl hydrogens at δH 5.66 (OH, d, J = 4.6 Hz) and 4.93 (OH, s), a methine signal at δH 4.22 (1H, d, J = 4.6 Hz), a methylene signal at δH 3.26, and two methyl signals at δH 2.07 and 0.91. The 13C NMR spectrum displays signals for 12 carbons atoms, 11 of which refer to two atoms each: two signals due to methyl carbon atoms (δC 19.2 and 18.8), ﬁve signals from the skeleton of the pyran rings (δC 157.8; 143.5; 141.0; 120.7 and 104.6), and four signals from the skeleton of the cyclohexenone, with one signal due to ketone carbonyl groups (δC 197.8; IR νmax 1667 cm−1), one due to quaternary unsaturated carbon atoms (δC 112.7), and two due to oxygenated carbon atoms (δC 75.6 and 71.0). The remaining signal refers to a methylene group (δC 18.5). The heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) spec- trum shows key correlations of CH2-10 to C-4a, C-5, C-6, C- 4a′, C-5′, and C-6′, revealing the attachment of two azaphilone units through a methylene bridge at position C-5 (Table 1). Furthermore, the presence of four hydroxyl groups was conﬁrmed by acetylation with pyridine−Ac2O to aﬀord the tetraacetylated derivative (9). NMR spectroscopy identiﬁes the structure of 2 as being formed by two austdiol units linked by a methylene group, generating a compound with the molecular formula C23H24O8 as determined by HRMS ([M + H]+ at m/z 429.1543). The chemical structure explains the simplicity of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, in which the signal intensities are doubled, except for the methylene group. Compound 2 is a chiral molecule having four asymmetric carbons and a formal binary symmetry axis. An accurate analysis of the eight enantiomeric pairs of 2 reveals that two pairs are formed by nonoptically active meso structures and two more pairs are repeated twice; as a result, four pairs of enantiomers and two meso structures are possible. Since the reliable assessment of the absolute conﬁguration of a compound is achieved when the theoretical chiroptical properties19 of all the possible optically active diastereomers are determined,20 quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations were performed on four diastereomers of 2 (Figure 3): (7R,8S,7′R,8′S)-2 (2A), (7R,8S,7′R,8′R)-2 (2B), (7R,8S,7′S,8′S)-2 (2C), and (7S,8S,7′S,8′S)-2 (2D). QM calculations were carried out Figure 1. Mycoleptones A−C and polyketides from Mycoleptodiscus indicus. Figure 2. ORTEP representation of mycoleptone A (atom displace- ment at 30% probability).

Prod. 2014, 77, 70−78 71 using density functional theory (DFT) and its time-dependent extension (TD-DFT); detailed results are reported in the Supporting Information. DFT geometry optimization (Table 2) yielded two equilibrium conformers having ΔEQM ≤ 2 kcal mol−1 for diastereomers 2A, 2B, and 2C, while a single equilibrium conformer within the same threshold energy was found for diastereomer 2D. The most populated conformers of 2A (Figure 4) display similar geometric features: the azaphilone units are oriented in an “open folder” conformation, the pyran oxygen atoms are pointing toward opposite directions, and all the hydroxy groups are equatorial and form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with each other and with the ketone carbonyl groups. The main diﬀerence lies in the direction of the axial methyl groups on C-7 and C-7′, which point outside the molecular cavity for 2A-e and inside for 2A-b. The experimental ECD spectrum of 2 in methanol (Figure 5) shows four bands. The broad positive band centered at 372 nm has a strong contribution from the n → π* transitions of the ketone carbonyls, which are aﬀected by the chiral environment around these groups. The positive band at 311 nm with a shoulder around 285 nm, the sharp negative peak at 252 nm, and the positive peak at 228 nm are due to π → π* transitions of the conjugated system, which are aﬀected by the chirality of the rings and by the mutual orientation of the azaphilone units. The theoretical ECD spectra of the diastereomers of 2 (Figure 6) displayed diﬀerent patterns, reﬂecting their diﬀerent stereochemistry. The comparison between the calculated spectrum of 2A and the experimental spectrum of 2 (Figure 7) shows that TD-DFT calculations are able to reproduce the experimental pattern of the transitions in the high-energy region, considering that transition energies are usually underestimated by PBE0.21 The transitions in the low- energy region are not reproduced, suggesting that QM calculations are unable to describe the chiral environment of the ketone moieties, in particular hydrogen-bonding inter- actions with hydroxy groups and solvent molecules, with adequate accuracy. On the other hand, the theoretical ECD spectra of the remaining diastereomers (reported in the Supporting Information) are unable to reproduce the experimental ECD pattern in the high-energy region: on this basis, a (7R,8S,7′R,8′S) absolute conﬁguration can be predicted for 2. Compound 2 crystallizes with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 2); the X-ray geometric parameters selected for comparison with the precursor austdiol are listed in Table 3. The C-5−C-10 distance was elongated upon change of hybridization to sp3 for atom C-10, and the C-5−C-4a distance was shortened, increasing the double-bond character. The pyran rings are almost planar with an rmsd from the mean plane of 0.03 Å, while the cyclohexenone rings adopt a twisted envelope conformation with atoms C-7 and C-7′ as ﬂap atoms. The X-ray structure of 2 shows that the azaphilone units have the same absolute conﬁguration as austdiol,22 retaining the stereochemistry of the chiral centers as (7R,8S); moreover, Table 1.

On the basis of the foregoing evidence, the structure of mycoleptone A (2) was therefore elucidated as (7R,8S,7′R,8′S)-5-[(7′,8′-dihydroxy-3′,7′-dimeth- yl-6′-oxo-7′,8′-dihydro-6′H-isochromen-5′-yl)methyl]-7,8-dihy- droxy-3,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-isochromen-6-one. The molecular formula of mycoleptone B (4) was determined as C23H24O8 by a combination of HRMS, 1H and 13C NMR, homonuclear correlation (COSY), heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (HMQC), and HMBC spectros- copies. The 1H NMR spectrum contains ﬁve doublets, four singlets, two double doublets, and one multiplet; some similarities with the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 are observed, with the presence of two hydrogen atoms on the pyran ring at δH 7.43 (1H, d, J = 1.8 Hz) and 6.63 (1H, s), an oxygenated sp3 methine group at δH 4.42 (1H, d, J = 1.8 Hz), a CH2 group at δH 3.60 (1H, d, Jgem = 15.0 Hz) and 3.53 (1H, d, Jgem = 15.0 Hz) due to the methylene bridge at position C-10 connecting the azaphilone unit to a dihydroisocoumarin moiety, and two methyl signals at δH 2.22 and 1.10. For the dihydroisocoumarin moiety, the 1H NMR spectrum displays an oxygen-bearing methine hydrogen at δH 4.55 (1H, m), a methylene group at δH 3.17 (1H, dd, J = 16.0, 3.0 Hz) and 2.60 (1H, dd, J = 16.0, 11.0 Hz), and two methyl groups at δH 2.06 (3H, s) and 1.44 (3H, d, J = 6.2 Hz). The 13C NMR spectrum of 4 displays signals for 23 carbon atoms: one signal due to the methylene bridge (δC 20.7), 11 signals belonging to the azaphilone moiety as in 2, Figure 3.

Prod. 2014, 77, 70−78 73 and 11 signals belonging to the dihydroisocoumarin moiety. The 13C NMR data reveal six resonances for sp2 carbon atoms being part of a benzene ring, two of them characterized by a downﬁeld shift due to the hydroxy substituents (C-6′ at δC 160.2; C-8′ at δC 160.9) and the presence of a carbonyl group at δC 171.2 (C-1′; IR νmax 1652 cm−1). The structural features of the lactone ring were determined from the 1H−1H COSY spectrum based on the couplings between H2-4′ and H-3′, as well as between H-3′ and H3-9′. The HMBC correlations of CH2-4′ to δC 136.8 (C-5′), δC 100.1 (C-8a′), δC 75.0 (C-3′), and δC 19.6 (C-9′) proved the connection of the two units. In addition, the HMBC spectrum displays relevant correlations from CH2-10 (δH 3.60, 3.53) to δC 199.3 (C-6), 143.7 (C-4a), and 112.8 (C-5) from the azaphilone moiety and to δC 160.9 (C-8′), 160.2 (C-6′), and 116.5 (C-7′) from the dihydroiso- coumarin moiety, characterizing the connection between the two units by a methylene bridge to aﬀord the compound (7R,8S)-5-[(6′,8′-dihydroxy-3′,5′-dimethyl-1′-oxoisochroman- 7′-yl)methyl]-7,8-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-iso- chromen-6-one. The molecular formula of mycoleptone C (5) was deduced as C23H22O8 by HRMS analysis in combination with 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The 1H NMR spectrum displays nine singlets and two doublets; as in compounds 2 and 4, the methylene group at δH 3.74 (1H, d, J = 15.0 Hz) and 3.46 (1H, d, J = 15.0 Hz) connects two moieties, the azaphilone and chromone units. The azaphilone moiety shows ﬁve uncoupled hydrogen atoms at δH 7.52 (H-1), 7.03 (H-4), 4.25 (H-8), 2.25 (H-9), and 1.00 (H-10); the chromone moiety displays four uncoupled hydrogen atoms at δH 13.06 (H-5′), 6.13 (H-3′), 2.37 (H-9′), and 2.00 (H-10′), the sharp singlet at δH 13.06 being interpreted as a hydrogen-bonded phenol hydroxy group. The 13C NMR spectrum conﬁrms 23 carbon signals, namely, four methyl, one methylene, four methine, and 14 quaternary carbon signals. The chromone moiety displays one ketone carbonyl group (δC 181.8; IR νmax 1690 cm−1) and four quaternary aromatic (δC 153.5, 107.8, 105.0, and 103.1), two oxygenated aromatic (δC 161.1 and 156.6), two unsaturated (δC 167.2 and 107.9), and two methyl (δC 20.2 and 8.5) carbon atoms. The structure of the chromone portion was determined on consideration of the molecular formula, double-bond equivalents, and the downﬁeld shifts of the carbon signals at C-2′ and C-8a′ (δC 167.2 and 153.5). The HMBC spectrum of 5 revealed relevant correlations of CH2-10 (δH 3.74, 3.46) to δC 200.5 (C-6), 144.3 (C-4a), and 112.1 (C-5) from the azaphilone moiety and to δC 161.1 (C-7′), 156.6 (C-5′), and 107.8 (C-6′) from the chromone moiety, revealing the Figure 5.

The presence of a methylene bridge is very uncommon among natural compounds, and only a few azaphilone dimers have been reported showing such a feature.15 Dicitrinones A− C23 were isolated from Penicillium citrinum, a volcano ash- derived fungus: the presence of a single sp3 carbon bridge, either a methine or methylene group, was proposed to derive from the carboxyl group of citrinin through decarboxylation, reduction, and Friedel−Crafts alkylation mediated by a polyketide biosynthetic pathway. The methylene bridge in aspergilone B,24 an azaphilone dimer that was isolated from a marine-derived fungus of the Aspergillus species, was hypothe- sized to derive from a formaldehyde biosynthetic pathway; the same hypothesis was proposed for the biosynthesis of xyloketal F,25 a dimer isolated from a mangrove fungus of the Xylaria species. The condensation of two austdiol units to form mycoleptone A (2) is consistent with a possible biosynthetic pathway similar to the one proposed for dicitrinone C23 (Figure 8). One austdiol unit may undergo decarbonylation, while the aldehyde group of the second austdiol unit may be reduced to a reactive carbocation species: the two units may then react by Friedel− Crafts alkylation. Similar pathways may also explain the condensation of the dihydroisocoumarin and chromone units with an austdiol unit in mycoleptones B (4) and C (5), respectively. Due to the limited number of methylene-bridged azaphilones discovered to date, however, a general biosynthetic pathway cannot be postulated, and the biologically mediated mechanisms of such reactions are unknown. The results of antileishmanial and cytotoxicity tests on the isolated compounds are shown in Table 4. Compounds 1−9 exhibit no signiﬁcant activity against Leishmania donovani and Leishmania major compared to the standard antileishmanial drugs Geneticin (L. major), amphotericin B, and pentamidin (L. donovani). Mycoleptone B (4) was the most cytotoxic metabolite (PC3 cells: IC50 = 7.1 ± 3.8 μM), but its activity was lower than that of doxorubicin, the reference compound for cytotoxicity assays. ■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured in CHCl3, MeOH, or DMSO using a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter at room temperature; IR spectra were recorded with KBr discs using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer. UV spectra were measured in CHCl3, MeOH, and DMSO on a Varian Cary 50 Bio UV−visible spectrophotometer. The HPLC system consisted of a Shimadzu SCL-10Avp multisolvent delivery system, a SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector, an Intel Celeron computer for analytical system control, data collection, and processing, and a Shim-pack CLC- ODS(M) reversed-phase column (250 × 4.5 mm i.d.; 5 μm particle size) protected by a Pelliguard LC-18 cartridge. The NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 1H NMR and 100 MHz for 13C NMR in CDCl3, CD3OD, or DMSO-d6; multiplicity determinations (DEPT) and 2D NMR spectra (COSY, HMQC, and HMBC) were obtained using standard Bruker pulse programs. The chemical shift values (δ) are given in parts per million (ppm), and the coupling constants are in Hz. HRMS were obtained by direct injection using a Bruker Bioapex FTMS spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI). UV and ECD spectra of 2 in MeOH (sample concentration: 19 μM) were recorded in the 500−215 nm spectral range on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter, using a 1 cm path length cell at room temperature: measurements Figure 8.

Prod. 2014, 77, 70−78 75 were carried out at 0.2 nm intervals using a 1 nm spectral bandwidth, a 20 nm min−1 scan rate, and a 4 s time constant. Fungal Material. The fungus was isolated as an endophyte from the medicinal plant Borreria verticillata (L.) G. F. W. Meyer, belonging to the Rubiaceae family, and is native to South America. Five specimens of B. verticillata with a healthy appearance were collected from the campus of the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) (34°56′57″ W; 8°2′53″ S) in January 2006, approximately 43 cm in height and bearing ﬂowers. Then, the samples were taken to the laboratory and processed in 24 h. A voucher specimen of the plant (No. 42.234/UFPE) was identiﬁed and deposited at the Herbarium Professor Geraldo Mariz, UFP, Department of Botany, UFPE, Recife, Brazil. The isolate was identiﬁed as Mycoleptodiscus indicus based on sequence analysis of the ITS region of the rDNA (GenBank accession number GU220382.1). Cultivation, Extraction, and Isolation. M. indicus was grown on potato dextrose agar plates for 7 days at 30 °C. Then, 10 plugs were transferred to ﬁve Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (500 mL), each containing 100 mL of potato dextrose broth prepared with distilled water. Flasks were shaken on a rotary shaker at 30 °C and 120 rpm for 48 h. Next, 10 mL was transferred to each of 50 ﬂasks containing 90 g of solid medium (rice-oat). These were grown for 30 days. On day 30, the mycelial mass was macerated with ethanol overnight and ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate was concentrated under vacuum to obtain a crude ethanol extract (22 g), which was partitioned with three times equal volumes of hexane and CH2Cl2, respectively, yielding hexane (6 g) and dichloromethane fractions (6.9 g). The CH2Cl2 fraction was suspended in MeOH and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min, furnishing a precipitate fraction (3870 mg) and a soluble fraction (3030 mg). The precipitate fraction was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (30 × 3.5 cm i.d.) using a MeOH−CH2Cl2 gradient to yield 67 fractions, which were combined on the basis of their TLC proﬁles into seven fractions: A (19 mg), B (33 mg), C (2968 mg), D (100 mg), E (210 mg), F (285 mg), and G (109 mg). Fraction C (2968 mg) yielded austdiol (2830 mg), after crystallization in MeOH, and fraction E aﬀorded mycoleptone A (2, 200 mg) by precipitation. The soluble fraction (3030 mg) was subjected to gel ﬁltration on a Sephadex LH-20 column (50 × 3 cm i.d.) using MeOH as the mobile phase, furnishing 10 fractions (S1−S10). Fraction S6 (280 mg) was washed with MeOH, yielding eugenitin (50 mg). The soluble portion was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (25 × 2 cm i.d.) using a MeOH−CH2Cl2 gradient. Forty-two fractions were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC proﬁles to yield nine fractions. The fourth fraction (S6.4, 28 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative silica gel TLC using hexane−ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v) as eluent to furnish mycoleptone B (4, 10 mg) and mycoleptone C (5, 2 mg). Fraction S5 (461 mg) was subjected to chromatography over a silica gel column (25 × 2 cm i.d.) eluted with a gradient of MeOH in CH2Cl2. Thirty fractions were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC proﬁles to yield 10 fractions. The fourth fraction (S5.4, 60 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative silica gel TLC using hexane−ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v) as eluent to provide 6-methoxyeugenin (14 mg). The ﬁfth fraction (S5.5, 4 mg) was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using CH3CN−H2O (10:90 to 100:0, v/v) as mobile phase at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min over 23 min, yielding 9-hydroxyeugenin (2 mg). Acetylation of Austdiol and Mycoleptone A (2). A solution containing austdiol (80 mg), pyridine (2 mL), and Ac2O (3 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. H2O (6 mL) was added into the reaction mixture, which was subsequently extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was evaporated to give a yellow, amorphous solid (140 mg), which was puriﬁed by preparative TLC eluted with a mixture of CH2Cl2−MeOH (98:2, v/v) to aﬀord the diacetylated derivative (8, 80.7 mg). Acetylation of mycoleptone A (2, 25 mg) was performed in a similar manner, yielding the tetraacetylated derivative (9, 20 mg). Quantum-Mechanical Calculations. Conformational analysis on the selected diastereomers of 2 was performed in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, a preliminary conformer distribution was determined by molecular mechanics (MM) calculations at the MMFF94s26 level using the Spartan’02 software.27 In the second step, DFT28,29 geometry optimizations were performed on the MM conformers having relative energies (ΔEMM) within a threshold value of 3 kcal mol−1. DFT calculations were carried out at the B97D/6-311+ +G(2d,2p) level30−33 using the Gaussian 09 software package.34 The Boltzmann distribution of conformers at 298.15 K and 1 atm was then calculated from the relative electronic energies (ΔEQM). TD-DFT35 calculations were carried out at the PBE0/6-311++G(2d,2p) level31−33,36−38 using the Gaussian 09 software package.34 All calculations were performed using the IEFPCM continuum solvation model39,40 for MeOH. Rotational strengths (Rj) and excitation wavelengths (λj) were calculated for the lowest 50 excited states on the optimized geometries having ΔEQM ≤ 2 kcal mol−1. Theoretical ECD spectra were then obtained by approximation of Rj values to Gaussian functions with a half-bandwidth at Δεmax/e (Δσ) of 0.3 eV, summation over all excited states, and conformational averaging, according to the Boltzmann distribution of conformers (χQM).41 Crystallographic Structure. Crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by crystallization from a methanol solution. A colorless prismatic crystal of approximate dimensions 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3 was used for the experiment. X-ray data were measured on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diﬀractometer employing graphite-monochro- mated Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 298 K and operating in the φ−ω scan mode. Crystal data: C23H24O8, M = 428.42, triclinic, space group P1, a = 10.473(6) Å, b = 11.223(3) Å, c = 11.429(2) Å, α = 60.65(2)°, β = 89.83(3)°, γ = 67.75(4)°, V = 1055.5(9) Å3, Z = 2, Dc = 1.348 g/cm3, F(000) = 452, and μ(Cu Kα) = 0.86 mm−1. All tested crystal samples showed gemination, and the sample used for data collection was visually homogeneous, but it showed pseudomerohedral twinning, which caused partial superposition of structure factors leading to high residuals during the structure reﬁnements. A total of 8384 reﬂections were collected (4273 unique plus 96.2% of Friedel mates) in the θ range 4.56° to 73.92° and index ranges h from 15 to −15, k from −24 to 25, and l from −15 to 15. Cell reﬁnement and data reduction were performed with the XCAD4 software suite. The structure was solved and reﬁned using the WingX with SHELX97 suite.42,43 Structure reﬁnement was performed on F2 by full-matrix least-squares calculations. Non-hydrogen atoms were reﬁned aniso- tropically, and all hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized coordinates and reﬁned as riding atoms with isotropic parameters relative to their parent atoms. The ﬁnal reﬁnement residuals were R1 = 0.091 (wR2 = 0.32) for 6964 observed reﬂections with I > 2σ(I), 575 variable parameters, and three restraints, being R1 = 0.11 (wR2 = 0.32) for all unique reﬂections with GoF = 1.41. The absolute structure Flack parameter was 0.1(3), indicating that the chiral sense was correctly chosen, although this number was not reliable, given the large standard deviation, in the absence of strong anomalous scatterers. Biological Assays. The microplate Alamar-Blue assay was used to determine growth inhibition against L. donovani.44 Antileishmanial (L. major) and cytotoxicity assays against human colon cancer (HCT-8) cells, human leukemia cancer (HL-60) cells, human melanoma cancer (MDA-MB435) cells, human prostate cancer (PC3) cells, human glioblastoma cancer (SF-95) cells, and human lymphocyte cells were assessed employing a colorimetric method.45 Austdiol (1): yellow crystal; mp 255−257 °C; [α]25 D +223 (c 1.0, DMSO); UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 212 (2.64), 255 (2.57), 333 (2.62) nm; IR (KBr) νmax 3470, 3373, 3100, 1679, 1604, 1471 cm−1; 1H NMR and 13C NMR reported in the Supporting Information; HRMS m/z 237.0759 [M + H]+ (calcd for C12H12O5 + H+, 237.0757).
