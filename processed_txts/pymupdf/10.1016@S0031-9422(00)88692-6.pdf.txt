Ahstraet-The  trunkwood  of Cro!on diasii Pit-es (Euphorbiaceae)  contains  diasin, a novel rearranged  Labdanic  diterpene which includes furan, carbomethoxy,  ji- and &lactone moieties. All ’ 3C NM R signals were assigned and  used in conjunction  with PMR data, for the elucidation of the relative configuration  of all chiral centers. A possible  biogenetic pathway to diasin is discussed.  INl-RODUCfION  Croton  diasii  Pires. a new euphorbiacean  [Z], is an  arboreous  species which may attain 15 m by 30 cm. The  analysed specimen was collected by the botanist  Jolio  Murq  Pires at the bank  of igarape  Aura. on the  EMBRAPA property, Belem, Par6 State.  RESULTS  Fractionation  of the C,H, extract of the trunkwood  led to the isolation of sitosterol, ferulates of fatty alcohols  and a compound designated diasin. The 0 atoms of its  molecular formula C2,HL107, determined  by HRMS,  were assigned to p-lactone (11~~ 1700 cm- ‘1 &lactone  (v  1740 cm - ‘) ester (rmsx 1720 cm- ‘) and furan (v,,,,~  31??, 1500, 87Ocm- r) moieties. The furan is @-substi-  tuted, as indicated by PMR signals (Table 1) typical of  one fl(6 6.42) and two a (6 7.44) protons. The base peak  of the MS (m/e 94.0416) most probably is also due to this  system linked to a vinyl group (talc. m/e 94.0419). In the  parent  compound,  the C, group linked to furan is  saturated.  This fact is revealed by PMR, both the  methine  and one of the methylene  hydrogens  being  represented  by double doublets. The methine signal is  easily analysed, since it appears at characteristically  low  field (6 5.45). The LIS-reagent  Eu(fod), was used at  270 MHz to shift at least one of the methylene signals  towards the low field end of the band envelope around  2 ppm. These band correlations  were confirmed  by  decoupling  experiments.  Partial constitution  I, which  fits these data, recognizes also the fact that, with the sole  exception of the furan oxygen, all oxy-functions ofdiasin  are part of carboxy groups.  Partial  constitution  f was confirmed  by catalytic  hydrogenolysis  to a hexahydroderivative  (partial con-  * Part 3 in the series “The Chemistry  of Brazilian  Euphor-  biaceae”.

In substitution  appeared a 4 proton multiplet  around  3.7 and a broad band at 6.1 which could be  eliminated by addition of D,O. Corresponding  changes  in the IR spectrum concerned the disappearance  of the  furan bands and the appearance  of the typical broad  CO,H-band  around 32OOcm-‘.  Signal multiplicity  (ddd) of a further oxymethine (6  4.86) ofdiasin revealed its vicinality to 3 hydrogens: one  (6 3.1, d) on carbon 1 to a carbonyl and to a fully substi-  tuted position and two represented by signals included  in the band envelope around 2 ppm. These correlations  were again confirmed by decoupling experiments and led  to partial  constitution  3. Since the PMR spectrum  indicates that diasin contains only one hydrogen on a  carbon vi&al  to a carbonyl, and this has already been  accounted  for, the carbons  linked  to the terminal  carbonyl in 3, as well as in the carbomethoxyl(6  3.8, s)  (4) of diasin must be quaternary.  PMR evidence points  additionally  to the presence of a quaternary  methyl (6  1.16, s) (5).  Partial constitutions  1, 3, 4 and 5 show a total of 4  carboxyls and 6 quatemary carbons and must thus share  one carboxyl and 3 quaternary carbons. Indeed, accord-  ing, to CMR  evidence (Table Ij, besides the substituted  furan position, only 2 quaternary  carbons exist in the  molecule.  The  sole combinations  of 1, 3, 4 and 5  respecting this requirement  are 6 and 7 which define  relative positions of all atoms of diasin, except for 2  methina  and 3 methylenes evidenced by CMR.  The constitution  of a rearranged labdanic diterpene  can thus be proposed for diasin. The relative configura-  tional details shown in its formula (8a) were deduced as  follows.  Alkaline hydrolysis of diasin (8a) and remethylation  of the reaction product led to isodiasin (8b). The reaction  was accompanied by two PMR changes: a,,_, 4.86 (ddd)  -+ 4.86 (dd) and S, _ s 3.1 (d) + 2.55 (s). Absence of H-7  H-8 coupling in 8b requires the H-C(7)-C(8hH dihedral  angle to be close to 90”, i.e. the trans-attachment  of the  &lactone to the decalin system. In consequence, the BC  1773  1774  Y. A. DE ALVAREVGA ef al.  Table  I. NMR data for diasin (Sa) in CDCI,  ‘T  ‘H  Position  GrWJp  a*  6(100 MHz)  6(270 MHz)?

Epimcrization  at  C-S of diasin was accompanied  furthermore  by an IR  shift of the Uactone  carbonyl  from 1740 to 1755cm-‘,  a phenomenon  which is paralleled  by the shift observed  in the epimerization  of columbin  (9a) into isocolumbin  (9b) [3]. The furan substituent  of the d-lactone  in diasin  is equatorial,  information  derived  from the coupling  constant  which characterizes  the H-l 1 axial, H-12 intcr-  action (J 12 Hz) and shows  also the latter hydrogen  to be  axial.  While the stereochemistry  of the lactone  is a conse-  quence of the stated facts, configurational  analysis of all  other  chiral centers  necessitated  assignment  and inter-  pretation  of CMR data.  The carbon  spectrum  contains  3 carbonyl  peaks at  177.9, 168.0 and 171.1 ppm, assigned respectively  to C-19  in analogy to a slmdar terpenoid  141, the b-lactone  [5--71  and the p-lactone  by defautt. The 4 additional  sp2 carbon  signals can be assigned  to the furan moiety, taking into  consideration  their multiplicity  and the shielding  caused  on carbons  14 and 16 by the p-substituent  [5.8].  Three of the sp3 carbons,  a methyl and 2 methines,  are  oxygenated.  Of the last two, the signal at 71.3 ppm is  assigned  to C-12 by analogy  to similar diterpene  furano-  lactones  [8, 93. The remaining  tetrahedral  carbons  are  attributed  by signal multiplicity  considerations  to one  methyl,  5 methylenes,  3 methines  and  2 quaternary  centers.  By analogy  to other  4-methyl-4-carboxy  terp  encs, C-4 corresponds  to the singlet at 45.2 ppm [4, IO],  while the other  quaternary  carbon.  C-9 must thus be  represented  by the singlet at 34.2 ppm. The third carbon  a to a carbonyl  group is a methine  which can be recog-  nixed  by its larger  residual  splitting  in the single-  frequency  off-resonance  decoupled  (sford)  spectrum,  with the decoupling  frequency  set at the high-field  end  of the proton  range. The methylene  signal at lowest field  can be attributed  only to C-l 1 in view of its sharpness  in  the sford  spectrum  (i.e. the absence  of second  order  coupling  [I I]) and in analogy  to a similar  system [9].  The  remaining  2 methine  and  4 methylenc  signals  appear very broadened  in the sford spectrum  and belong  therefore  to the strongly  proton-coupled  chain encom-  passing carbons  3,2,I.10,5 and 6. Their complete  assign-  ment is only possible  through  the stereochemical  argu-  ments that follow.  The configurational  problems  yet to be solved concern  the stereochemistries  of C-4 and the AB ring junction.  The  very high  field resonance  of the corresponding  signal indicates  the axial nature of the C4 methyl group  [lo]. The chemical shift of C-3 is a good probe ofthe AB  Diasin, a diterpene  from Croton dimii  1775  ring junction  stereochemistry.  If these two rings were  trans-fused,  the  C-3 resonance  would  appear  at ca  37 ppm [4, lo]. In diasin @a), however,  the lowest-field  yet unassigned  methylene  signal appears  at 29Sppm,  indicating  that ring A is axially substituted  by C-6 and,  therefore,  that the two rings are cis-fused.  An examination  of molecular  models  indicates  that,  in the above configuration,  ring B of diasin. constrained  to a boat form, is flanked by rings A and C, which most  probably  assume the chair conformation.  This being the  case, the two bridgehead  methines,  while having  the  same number  of fi effects, are exposed  to a different  number of y interactions-one  (due to one of the oxygens  of the ester function)  in the case of C-5, and 3 (due to  C-12, C-17 and C-18) in the case ofC-10. Thus, the latter  carbon  absorbs  at a higher  field. Furthermore,  C-6 is  axial to ring A, and is shielded  by 7 interactions  with  carbons  1 and 3, in addition  to C-19. The only two yet  unassigned  signals arc almost coincident  and correspond  to  C-l  and  C-2.  In cis-decalin,  the  former  carbon  absorbs  at 29.8 ppm [IZ]. The strong shielding  of C-l in  diasin  relative  to this  model  reflects  the very small  C(l)-C(lOkC(9)-C(20)  dihedral  angle.  Due to the re-  ciprocity  of this y effect,  carbon  20 is also strongly  shielded  relative  to a typical  y-lactone  carbonyl  [5].  Finally,  the shift of C-2 is very similar in diasin and in  IO-methylated  diterpenes  [lo],  in spite of the fact that  two 7 effects act upon C-2 in these models.  Since only one y effect is felt by C-Z of diasin,  the  interaction  between  carbons  2 and 18 is stronger  here  than expected,  an observation  confirmed  by the absorp  tion  of C-18 at an unusually  high-field.  In the  lO-  methylated  trans-fused  diterpenes  [lo], the action of the  0  same number  of y substituents  results in a C-18 shift at  16.1 ppm, as compared  to 13.7 ppm in diasin.  Taken  together  CMR data convey the impression  that diasin is  a highly compact  molecule  in which strong steric inter-  actions prevail.  Although  columbin  (9a) is an additional  example,  AB  cis-fused  diterpenoids  such as diasin  @a) seem to be  extremely  rare in nature.  In the present  case, this con-  figuration  can  be  rationalized,  considering  the  re-  arranged  labdanic  cation  10 and  the derived  cyclo-  propane  lla  and  cyclopropanol  Ilb  as biogenetic  intermediates.  Indeed, the Euphorbiaceae  are known for  the presence  of hydroxylated  cyclopropane  derivatives  [12].  Opening  of cyclopropanols  with  inversion  of  configuration  is known  to occur in vitro [14]. Such a  reaction  would lead to cis-fused  AR rings and an oxy-  genated  C-19, as observed  in diasin (8a).  EXPERlMENTAL  Ground  wood of C. diasii (2 kg) was extracted  with C,H,  in  a Soxhler  apparatus.  The extract  (30 g) was chromarographed  on a silica column.  Elution  of 40 x 25Oml fractions  was per-  formed  with C,H,  (6 frs), C,H,-CHCI,  4: 1 (frs 7-14). C,H,-  CHCI,  1: 1 (frs 15-28), C,H,-EtOAc  4: I (frs 29-36) and EtOAc  (4 frs). The residue of frs 7- 14 was rechtomatographed  to yield  ferulates  of fatty alcohols  (390 mg). The residue of frs IS-28 was  washed  with  petrol  and  crystallized  from  MeOH to give  sitosterol. The residue of frs 29-36 was rechromatographed  by  preparative-TLC  (Si gel, C,H,-EtOAc  1: 1) to give diasin  (200 mg).
