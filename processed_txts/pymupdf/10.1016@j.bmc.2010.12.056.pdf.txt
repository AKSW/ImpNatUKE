Eleven acridone alkaloids were isolated from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. (Rutaceae), with eight of them being identiﬁed as potent and reversible inhibitors of cathepsin V (IC50 values ranging from 1.2 to 3.9 lM). Detailed mechanistic characterization of the effects of these compounds on the cathepsin V-cat- alyzed reaction showed clear competitive inhibition with respect to substrate, with dissociation con- stants (Ki) in the low micromolar range (2, Ki = 1.2 lM; 6, Ki = 1.0 lM; 7, Ki = 0.2 lM; and 11, Ki = 1.7 lM). Molecular modeling studies provided important insight into the structural basis for binding afﬁnity and enzyme inhibition. Experimental and computational approaches, including biological evalu- ation, mode of action assessment and modeling studies were successfully employed in the discovery of a small series of acridone alkaloid derivatives as competitive inhibitors of catV. The most potent inhibitor (7) has a Ki value of 200 nM. � 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Cathepsins, also known as lysosomal cysteine peptidases, are members of the papain-like peptidase family, which are implicated in many pathological conditions. These enzymes have been inten- sively studied as valuable targets for drug discovery and develop- ment.1,2 Although the major role of cathepsins is related to the terminal protein degradation in lysosomes, it has been shown that these enzymes are also involved in other relevant biochemical pathways, acting at selective and controlled processes with speciﬁc functions associated to their restricted tissue localization.3 In addi- tion, evidence has indicated that cysteine cathepsins have speciﬁc intra- and extracellular functions, being involved in a number of diseases including cancer, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, autoim- mune disorders, and viral infections.4 Cathepsin V (CatV, EC 3.4.22.43) was identiﬁed as a lysosomal cysteine protease speciﬁcally expressed in thymus, testis and cor- neal epithelium.5–7 The in vivo role of cathepsin V has been associ- ated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presentation pathway in humans8 and, in pathological conditions, the enzyme has been considered as a potential diagnostic marker for colon tumors.6 The enzyme is also expressed in colorectal and breast carcinomas but not in normal colon or mammary tissue. It is believed that cathepsin V plays a role in cancer progression, thus becoming a valuable drug target for oncology.9 Moreover, cathep- sin V has been identiﬁed as having potent elastolytic activity expressed in activated macrophages and, together with the lysosomal cathepsins L, K, and S, has been implicated in atheroscle- rosis.10,11 Signiﬁcant progress has been made to elucidate the rela- tionship between cysteine cathepsins and several pathological states. For instance, cathepsins K and S have been validated as drug targets for the treatment of osteoporosis and immune disorders, respectively.4 Natural products have provided considerable value to the phar- maceutical industry over the past century. Natural products repre- sent a rich source of structural diversity and biological activities, providing many drugs and lead compounds for the treatment of a variety of human diseases successfully developed for the treat of human diseases in many therapeutic areas.12 Several natural products have been investigated for their inhib- itory effects on the catalytic activity of cathepsins.4,13–15 Acridone alkaloids are a group of naturally occurring nitrogen heterocyclic compounds that have shown a large spectrum of biological activi- ties, including antiparasitic,16–18 antiviral,19 and cytotoxic.18,20–22 In the present work we described the biological evaluation and type of inhibition studies for a series of acridone alkaloids as potent inhibitors of cathepsin V. Molecular modeling and preliminary structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies were also performed to investigate the molecular basis underlying the binding afﬁnity and inhibitory potency of this series of naturally occurring compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst example 0968-0896/$ - see front matter � 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.bmc.2010.12.056 ⇑ Corresponding author.

Expression and puriﬁcation of cathepsin V Recombinant human cathepsin V was produced using the Pichia pastoris expression system as previously described.7 The molar concentration of the enzyme was determined by active site titra- tion with E-64 following the conditions previously described.23 2.3. Kinetic measurements All commercially available chemicals and reagents were pur- chased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Sigma and used without fur- ther puriﬁcation. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared at a concentration of 1 mM in DMSO and diluted to the appropriate concentration prior to the assays. The inhibitors were screened against cathepsin V at an initial concentration of 25 lM. The in vitro enzyme inhibition experiments were carried out in tripli- cate (in 96-well black plates) as previously described.24 The ﬁnal volume of the reaction mixture was 200 lL, kept under stirring. Each well contained 191 lL of a 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM dithioerythritol (DTE), 2 lL of 1 mM Z-Phe-Arg-MCA dissolved in DMSO, 5 lL of sample, and 32 nM of cathepsin V. The enzyme was activated during 5 min with DTE at 27 �C, and then the reaction mixture was incubated during 5 min with the sample. The reactions were started by the addition of the ﬂuorogenic substrate 4-methyl- coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) and measurements were conduct using the Molecular Devices Spectra MAX GEMINI XS (excitation 355 nm, and emission 460 nm). Control assays were performed without inhibitor (negative control) and in the presence of the irre- versible inhibitor for cysteine peptidase, E-64 (positive control). The IC50 values were independently determined by making rate measurements for at least ﬁve inhibitor concentrations. The type of inhibition and Ki values were determined under the same experimental conditions for three different inhibitor concentra- tions at ﬁve varying substrate concentrations (6.4, 9.6, 13, 19, and 38 lM). All kinetic parameters were determined from the collected data by nonlinear regression employing the SigmaPlot enzyme kinetics module. The values represent means ± SD of at least three individual experiments. 2.4. Molecular modeling The X-ray crystallographic data for catV in complex with APC-3316 (an irreversible vinyl sulfone inhibitor) used in docking simulations were retrieved from PDB (PDB ID, 1FH0). For the calcu- lations, hydrogen atoms were added in standard geometry, using the Biopolymer module as implemented in the SYBYL 8.0 package (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux workstations. The only exception was the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys25), which was deprotonated during docking simulations. The histidine, glutamine, and asparagine residues in the active binding site were manually checked for possible ﬂipped orientation, protonation, and tautomeric states with the Pymol 0.99 (DeLano Scientiﬁc, San Carlos, CA) side-chain wizard script. The active site was deﬁned incorporating all amino acid residues within a radius sphere of 6.0 Å centered on the bound ligand. Molecular modeling studies were carried out using the default parameters of FlexX (BioSolveIT, Sankt Augustin, Germany).25 The FlexX scoring func- tion was employed to select the representative pose for each com- pound of this series. Subsequently, the top-ranked conformations for each compound were submitted to the web-based interface DrugScoreONLINE to rescore the proposed binding mode.26,27 Finally, the individual ranks obtained from the consensus scoring were considered to establish a new rank order list where the top-ranked inhibitor were selected for visual inspection. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Biochemical evaluation and preliminary SAR studies As part of our ongoing research program aimed at discovering natural products as new potent inhibitors of cathepsins K, V, L, and S, we have screened a collection of 270 compounds, from which 111 were natural products isolated from Brazilian plants. The major classes evaluated in this study included cumarins, triter- penes, cinnamic acids, amides, lignans, ﬂavonoids, alkaloids, and limonoids. The percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the equation: % inhibition ¼ 100 � ð1 � Vi=V0Þ where Vi and V0 are initial velocities (enzyme activities) determi- nate in presence and in the absence of inhibitor, respectively. Among the compounds tested, the most promising results against the cathepsins were obtained for the alkaloid and ﬂavonoid derivatives, including a series of acridone alkaloids (1–11), which showed potent inhibitory activity against cathepsin V. The chemi- cal structures and corresponding IC50 values (concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of cathepsin V) for the set of compounds (1–11) are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, com- pound 7 is the most potent inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 1.2 lM. This is a valuable result since acridone alkaloids as catV inhibitors have not been described in the literature. In addition to compound 7, compounds 1–3, 6, 10, and 11 also showed sub- stantial inhibition with IC50 values in the range of 2.2–5.2 lM. Compounds 4 and 5 showed only moderate inhibition, with IC50 values of 25 and 10 lM, respectively. The isomeric tetracyclic sys- tem (compounds 8 and 9) also showed low inhibitory potency, with IC50 values of 48 and 44 lM, respectively. The most potent inhibitors of the series (2, 4–7, 10, and 11) were then selected for further kinetic studies for determination of the type of inhibition and dissociation constants (Ki). 3.2. Mechanism of inhibition In order to explore the mechanism of inhibition in more detail, we have determined Ki values (Table 1) and the type of inhibition with respect to the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA employing com- pounds 2, 4–7, 10, and 11. The results indicate that the inhibition of catV was found to be competitive with respect to the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA (Fig. 1). The Lineweaver–Burk double-reciprocal plots show intercepts of all lines (obtained at three different inhibitor concentrations) converging at the y-axis (1/Vmax), whereas the slope (KM/Vmax) and x-axis intercepts (�1/KM) vary with inhibitor concentration. Consequently, the Vmax values remain constant, whereas the apparent values of KM (Kapp M , deﬁned as KM(1 + [I]/Ki)) increase with increasing inhibitor concentrations. This behavior is consistent with a mutually exclusive binding mode between inhibitor and substrate, therefore, these inhibitors (2, 4–7, 10, and 11) compete with Z-Phe-Arg-MCA for the free enzyme ac- tive site. Another factor that must be considered in inhibitor drug design is the comparisons on the rational basis of the enzyme dis- sociation constant (Ki), since IC50 values can vary with substrate concentration for competitive inhibitors. The same data of Figure 1 was employed to determine the Ki values of the competitive inhibitors using Dixon plots, which consist in plotting the recipro- cal of the initial velocity (1/V0) versus a series of inhibitor concentrations at constant substrate concentrations, where the R. P. Severino et al. / Bioorg. Med. Chem. 19 (2011) 1477–1481 1479 lines converge above the x-axis, indicating the inhibition constant �Ki. The Ki values for inhibitors 2, 4–7, 10, and 11 are listed in Table 1. Accordingly, the results conﬁrm the acridone alkaloid derivatives as a new class of competitive inhibitors of catV, with afﬁnity values in the low micromolar range. 3.3. Molecular modeling studies The integration of experimental and computational approaches has become a vital component of structure- and ligand-based ap- proaches.28–31 Despite the strong evidence that the acridone alka- loids bind to the active site of the enzyme, the kinetic data does not provide insights into the binding proﬁle of the inhibitors (in the substrate pocket of catV). Therefore, molecular modeling studies were carried out to complement the kinetic ﬁndings and to inves- tigate the mode of interaction of these inhibitors.30,31 To achieve this, the compounds of this series were docked into the active site of catV. Although a quantitative agreement between the model and experimental SAR data was not expected, the model provided rel- evant insights into the inhibitory activity of the acridone alkaloid derivatives. The best predicted orientation of the representative inhibitor of this series, compound 7 (Ki = 200 nM), within the catV binding pocket is depicted in Figure 2. It can be seen that the inhib- itor binds to the central region of the catV substrate binding site, close to the catalytic residues Cys25 and His159. The inhibitor interacts to the enzyme through a set of four hydrogen bonds: (i) the 1-hydroxyl substituent is positioned at the S1 pocket as a hydrogen bond donor to the main-chain carbonyl group of Gly23; (ii) the oxygen atom of the 2-methoxy substituent accepts a hydrogen bond from the NH2 side-chain of Gln19, which is part of the oxyanion hole in catV;10 (iii) the 5-hydroxyl substituent binds to the S2 pocket acting as a hydrogen bond donor to the main-chain carbonyl group of Leu157; and (iv) the 9-carbonyl group binds to the S3 pocket by accepting a hydrogen bond from the NH main-chain of Gly66. In addition to the polar contacts, non-polar interactions contribute to the orientation of 7 in the catV binding site. The 1-hydroxyl and 2,3,4-trimethoxy substituted rings form van der Waals contacts with the side-chains of Phe67 and Cys25, respectively. These ﬁndings are in agreement with our SAR data, which indicated that the presence of polar substitu- ents at R1 (2-position) and less bulky groups at R4 (8-position) are favorable for enhanced inhibitory activity. Moreover, this confor- mation also suggests a structural feature that might be involved in the preferential binding of the 2-methoxy derivatives at R1 (7) compared with the corresponding isoprenoid (1–3) or unsubstitut- ed derivatives (4–6; 8–10). According to the model, the Gln19 res- idue would represent a hydrogen-bonding site to interact with the inhibitor in order to incorporate selected molecules inside the binding cavity of the enzyme, thereby contributing to the im- proved afﬁnity of the inhibitor 7. This observation is supported by the ﬁnding that the S10 would play a major role in the design of inhibitors having improved potency and afﬁnity.10 4. Conclusion In this work, we described a new series of acridone alkaloid derivatives as potent inhibitors of the enzyme catV. The kinetic and type of inhibition studies revealed that the compounds of this class are reversible competitive inhibitors of the target enzyme with afﬁnity in the low micromolar range. The SAR and molecular modeling investigations indicated important molecular and struc- tural features underlying the inhibitory activity of this series.
