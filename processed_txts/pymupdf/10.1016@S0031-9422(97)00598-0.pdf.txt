Jack, which is native to  Southeast Asia, was introduced  to Brazil and has  flourished in Slo Paulo state. In Brazil it is used as an  ornamental  plant, but this plant is used for its med-  icinal properties in tropical and subtropical Asia [l].  A search for previous phytochemical  studies of M.  paniculuta  revealed that only the coumarin, coumur-  rayin, has been reported from the ripe fruits of this  species [2]. Working separately on peel and pulp of  the fresh ripe fruits, we have isolated only poly-  methoxylated flavones, flavonols and flavanonols.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The dichloromethane  extract of the peel of M.  puniculata  after successive chromatographic  sep-  arations  afforded six flavonoids:  5,7,3’,4’,5’-penta-  methoxyflavanonol[3,4],  5,6,7,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxy-  flavone (1) [5], 3,5,7,8,3’,4’,5’-heptamethoxyflavone  (2) [6], 5,7,8,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyflavone  (3) [7], 5-  hydroxy-3,7,8,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyflavone  (4) and 8-  hydroxy-3,5,7,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyllavone  (5). Com-  pounds 4 and 5 appear to be novel.  The i3C NMR data for 2 and 3 do not appear to  have been reported in the literature. Thus, the 13C  chemical shifts of 2 and 3 have been listed in Table 1  using 1 and 5,7,8,2’,3’,4’,5’-heptamethoxyflavone  (6)  [3] as models. The carbon signals of 1, isolated from  *Based in part on the Ph.D. thesis presented by R.J.F. to  the Universidade Federal de Slo Carlos.  t Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.  Neoraputia  magniJica  (Rutaceae), were assigned by  use of HMQC and HMBC experiments [5].  Compound 4 was obtained as a yellow powder. The  presence of a flavonoid nucleus was suggested by its  UV and IR spectra. In the ‘H NMR spectrum (Table  2) of 4, three aromatic protons appeared at 6 6.43  (lH, s) and 6 7.52 (2H, s, H-2’ and H-6’), one hydroxyl  group at 6 12.38 (lH, s, OH-5) and six methoxy groups  at 6 3.95 (6H, s), 3.94 (6H, s), 3.92 (3H, s), and 3.90  (3H, s). The assignment of one singlet to H-2’ and H-  6’ suggested that three methoxyls were attached to  the B-ring. Furthermore,  the singlet at 6 6.43 clearly  indicated  the A-ring to be 5,6,7- or 5,7,8-trisub-  stituted. A comparison  of 13C chemical shifts of 5-  hydroxy-7,8-  and  5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone  and  5-hydroxy-3,7,8-  and  5-hydroxy-3,6,7-tri-  methoxyflavonol  indicated that the C-6 methine (ca 6  96) resonates at a lower field than the C-8 methine (ca  6 91) [3]. Thus, the correct A-ring structure  was,  decided on the basis of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table  l), which showed a signal at 6 95.5 for C-6, so placing  the methoxyl substituents at C-7 and C-8. Moreover,  the 13C NMR spectrum showed signals for three meth-  oxyl groups at 6 61.5, 61.0 and 60.3, indicating a 3-  methoxyflavonol  derivative and confirming the oxy-  genation patterns in the A and B-rings. This was cor-  roborated by the fragments at m/z 207 [C12H,404-  Me]+ and 181 [C9H805 -Me]+,  associated with the  retro-Diels-Alder  cleavage of the C-ring followed by  the loss of a methyl group, respectively. From these  data 4 was characterized as 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3’,4’,5’-  hexamethoxyflavone.  The structural assignment was  also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spec-  trum  with  those  of 4’,5-dihydroxy-3,3’,7,8-tetra-  methoxyflavone  (ternatin,  7) and 4’,5-dihydroxy-  393  R. J.

Complete and unambiguous  r3C NMR assign-  ments for 8 were made using the HMBC technique  PI.  Compound 5 exhibited similar NMR spectra to 4  (Table 1 and 2) except for the absence of the signal for  one chelated hydroxyl. The mass spectrum indicated  a molecular formula C2,H2209 ([Ml+ = 418), which  strongly suggested an isomer of 4. The 13C NMR  spectrum (Table 1) showed signals for two methoxyl  groups at 6 6 1.3 and 60.1, which were assigned to the  3- and 4’- positions. This implies that the methoxyls  in the A-ring were located at C-5 and C-7 (6 56.4 and  56.1) and determined  the position of the hydroxyl  group at C-8. The 5,7,8- and 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavones  can be differentiated by the 13C NMR chemical shifts  of the unsubstituted  methine which absorbs at 6 92.6  OH  0  7:&=OMe  &Rq=OPre  (C-6, for example 6) in the case of the former [3] and  at 6 96.3 (C-8, for example 1) in the case of the latter.  Thus, the 13C signal at 6 91.6 for C-6 supported the  proposed structure of 5 as 8-hydroxy-3,5,7,3’,4’,5’-  hexamethoxyflavone.  A hexane-soluble fraction of the hydromethanolic  extract of pulp after successive chromatographic  sep-  arations afforded three flavonols: 4, 9 and 10. Com-  pound 4 could not be separated from a small amount  of 9. The ‘H NMR in addition to signals described  above for 4, revealed the presence of three protons in  the B-ring, giving rise to an ABC coupling system (6  7.02, d, J = 8.8 Hz, H-5’; 6 7.81, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-  2’, 6 7.86, dd, J = 8.8 and 2.0 Hz, H-6’). This was  supported by the mass spectrum which showed frag-  ments  at  m/z  177 [C1rHn03-Me]+  and  181  [C,Hs05 - Me]+ due to the retro-Diels-Alder  cleavage  Flavonoids from Murraya paniculata  Table 1. “C NMR chemical shift for compounds 2-5 and 10 and selected carbons in the model  compounds 1 and 6-g  395  C  1  2  3  6  4  7  8  5  10  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  1’  2  3’  4  5’  6  OMe  OMe  OMe  OMe  OMe  OMe  OMe  161.0  108.3  117.2  154.5  140.4  157.8  96.3  152.6  112.9  126.9  103.4  153.6  140.9  153.6  103.4  56.4  56.4  56.4  61.1  61.6  62.2  156.1  139.6  174.0  151.6  91.9  156.2  130.0  150.5  108.8  125.9  105.2  152.8  141.0  152.8  105.2  55.8  55.8  56.1  56.2  59.7  62.0  62.4  160.2  158.0  155.1  107.8  112.3  138.8  177.8  177.7  179.0  151.9  151.8  158.5  92.3  92.6  95.5  156.6  156.3  157.4  130.5  130.5  128.8  156.3  156.1  147.1  108.7  106.0  105.0  126.6  119.7  125.6  103.1  147.2  105.9  153.4  145.4  153.1  140.7  149.2  140.1  153.4  147.4  153.1  103.1  106.0  105.9  55.9  56.0  56.2  56.1  56.1  56.2  56.2  56.4  56.4  56.5  61.0  60.3  61.0  61.1  61.0  61.4  61.2  61.5  156.9  139.2  179.8  158.3  96.6  159.4  129.8  149.2  105.2  122.4  112.9  149.1  152.1  117.3  123.9  56.3  56.9  60.4  61.9  156.8  139.2  179.8  158.2  97.7  158.8  130.1  149.4  106.2  122.5  112.9  149.0  152.1  117.3  123.9  56.1  60.5  61.9  156.1  137.7  172.3  150.8  91.6  156.8  130.3  141.6  105.9  126.5  104.6  153.2  139.3  153.2  104.6  56.1  56.1  56.1  56.4  61.0  61.3  157.7  140.1  173.7  153.5  140.2  157.8  96.0  152.4  113.1  125.1  105.8  153.1  141.1  153.1  105.8  56.4  56.4  56.4  60.1  61.0  61.6  62.3  Table 2. ‘H NMR chemical shift for compounds 4,5 and 9  H  6  2  5  6  OH  OMe  OMe  OMe  OMe  OMe  OMe  4  6.43 s  7.52 s  7.52 s  12.38 s  3.90 s  3.92 s  3.94 s  3.94 s  3.95 s  3.95 s  5  6.42 s  7.61 s  7.61 s  3.92 s  3.93 s  3.95 s  3.95 s  3.95 s  4.02 s  9  6.43 s  7.81 d(2.0)  7.02 d (8.8)  7.86 dd (8.8,2.0)  12.47 s  3.89 s  3.91 s  3.93 s  3.96 s  3.98 s  of the C-ring  followed by loss of a methyl group,  respectively. These data were consistent with the struc-  ture  of 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,3’,4’-pentamethoxytlavone  for 9, which has been found previously in Citrus retic-  ulutu (tangerine peel) [9].  Compound  10 gave spectral data in agreement  with  those  published  for  3,5,6,7,3’,4’,5’-hepta-  methoxyilavonol  [lo]. However, its 13C NMR data do  not appear to have been reported previously in the  literature. Thus, they have been listed in Table 1 using  1, 2 and 3 as models.  A dichloromethane-soluble  fraction of the meth-  anolic  pulp  extract  gave four flavonoids:  3, 5,  5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentamethoxyflavanonol  [3, 41 and 3,5,7,  8,3’,4’-hexamethoxyflavone  [3, 111.  Other organs of M. paniculata have long been the  subject of extensive chemical investigations,  which  have proved that it is a rich source of coumarins,  flavones and flavonols as are other plants of the Aur-  antioideae [12]. The leaves have been reported to con-  tain 2 [13], 3 [l, 131 and 10 [lo], while 3 has also been  found in the roots [7]. Flavonol  1 has been isolated  from the leaves of M. exotica [6], which has been  considered to be a synonym of M. paniculata [14]. By  contrast, the flowers appear to be poor in flavonoids.  However, the only flavonol,  3,5,7,3’,4’,5’-hexame-  thoxyflavone, reported from the flowers shows an oxi-  dation level comparable to those of the leaves.  Flavonol  9, 3,5,7,8,3’,4’-hexamethoxyflavone  and  5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentamethoxyflavanonol  are reported for  the first time from the Murruya, while the latter does  not appear to have been recorded previously from the  Rutaceae.

Isolation of compounds. The seeds, peel and pulp of  the fresh ripe fruits were sepd by a perforated plate  sieve (0.5 mm; tyler 32). The seeds and peel were dried,  powdered and successively extracted with hexane,  CH,C12 and MeOH. The pulp was stirred with MeOH  at room temp. The extract was decanted, and the  residual pulp similarly extracted a second time. The  combined extracts were evapd under vacuum and the  residue partitioned  into hexane-, CH2C12-, MeOH-  and n-BuOH-soluble  frs.  The coned CH2C1, extract of peel was submitted to  vacuum chromatography  over silica gel using hexane-  Me,CO  (9:1), yielding  48 frs.
