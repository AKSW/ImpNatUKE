This is the first chemical study on the leaves of  Ocotea elegans and O. corymbosa as well as the first report of non-volatile compounds from Persea pyrifolia.  Keywords: Lauraceae; Ocotea; Persea. INTRODUCTION The Lauraceae family comprises 52 genera and approximately  3000 species, mostly from tropical and warm subtropical regions of  the world.1 Lauraceae species present several groups of secondary  metabolites, most of them aromatic, which seem to be relevant for  chemotaxonomic classification in Lauraceae.2  The genus Ocotea comprises ca. 350 species. Previous phytoche- mical studies have revealed the presence of neolignans, benzylisoqui- noline alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and sesquiterpenes,3  besides a variety of volatile components from its essential oils.1 Ocotea  elegans is known as canela de ferro or canela preta in Brazil where it  is widespread. Despite its huge distribution, the only study performed  on O. elegans reports the isolation of neolignans from the stems by  using countercurrent chromatography.4 Ocotea corymbosa is popularly  known as canela de corvo or canela fedorenta in Brazil and its wood  is employed in the civil construction industry.5 Only two studies were  performed on O. corymbosa; monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes as  well as phytosterols were isolated from the unripe fruits3 and sesqui- terpenes with calamenene skeleton were characterized from its bark.6  No previous studies have been performed on leaves of O. corymbosa.  Persea is a genus that comprises ca. 200 species, the most well  studied of these being P. americana Mill, known as “avocado fruit”.  Previous phytochemical studies on avocado seeds identified various  classes of natural products such as phytosterols, triterpenes,7 fatty acids  with olefinic and acetylenic bonds,8 alkylfurans,9 dimers of flavanols,10  oligomeric proanthocyanidins11 and glucosylated abscisic acids.12 Persea  pyrifolia is popularly known as maçaranduba and it is frequently em- ployed in the furniture manufacturing industry.13 The only study carried  out on P. pyrifolia dealt with volatile compounds from the leaves.14  As part of our on-going program devoted to phytochemical inves- tigations on Brazilian Lauraceae species, in this work we report the  isolation of an ester of the 4-O-E-caffeoylquinic acid (1) and three  flavonoids (2-4) from O. corymbosa, an aromatic sesquiterpene (5)  and a flavonoid (6) from O. elegans as well as four furofuran lignans  (7-10) from P. pyrifolia. This is the first chemical study on the leaves  of O. elegans and O. corymbosa as well as the first report of non- volatile compounds from P. pyrifolia. EXPERIMENTAL General Analytical and preparative HPLC separations were performed by  using stainless-steel Phenomenex Luna phenyl-hexyl (250 x 4.6 mm  and 250 x 22 mm, 5 and 10 mm particle size, respectively) and Phe- nomenex Luna C-18 (250 x 4.6 mm and 250 x 22 mm, 5 and 10 mm  particle size, respectively). Mobile phases for chromatography were  prepared from HPLC grade solvents. Methanol and acetonitrile were  obtained from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA) and Tedia (Fairfield,  OH, USA), respectively. Water was purified in-house with a Millipore  Milli-Q system (Billerica, MA, USA). The analytical HPLC separations  were carried out using a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) LC-10Ai pump sys- tem, a Shimadzu SIL-10Ai auto injector and a Shimadzu SPD-10Avp  UV-Vis detector. The HPLC system used for preparative separations  was a Varian (Walnut Creek, CA, USA) PrepStar SD-1 equipped with  a Rheodyne (Cotati, CA, USA) injector with a 2 mL sample loop and  a ProStar UV-Vis detector. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian  Inova 500 FT-NMR (Palo Alto, CA, USA) spectrometer operating at  500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C). Chemical shifts were referenced  relative to TMS or the corresponding residual solvent signals. Deute- rated solvents (CDCl3 and DMSO-d6) were purchased from Cambridge  Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA, USA). DCCC separations  were performed using an EYELA D.C.C. - 300 (Tokyo Rikakikai CO  LTD). All solvents used for column chromatography (CC) as well as  for DCCC were from analytical grade. Silica gel for CC (60-200 µm)  was purchased from Acros Organics (New Jersey, NJ, USA). Plant material The specimens O. elegans Mez. and P. pyrifolia Nees & Mart.  ex Nees were collected at Fazenda Campininha, Mogi-Guaçu, SP;  Batista et al. 322 Quim. Nova O. corymbosa (Meins) Mez. was collected in Araraquara, SP, Brazil.  Voucher specimens of O. elegans (Moraes 06), O. corymbosa (deLuca  001) and P. pyrifolia (Lima 136) are deposited at the Herbarium of  Instituto de Botânica, SP, Brazil. Extraction and isolation of chemical constituents In order to delineate this work, our selection criterion for the  elected fractions was based on monitoring the occurrence of signals  in the region of aromatic chemical shifts in the 1H NMR spectra. For  each studied species, only fractions showing aromatic signals were  selected for further chromatographic separations.  The dried and powdered leaves (200 g) of O. corymbosa were  sequentially extracted with hexane and methanol at room temperature  (3 x 1000 mL, 3 days). The solvents were evaporated under redu- ced pressure. The methanolic residue (13.6 g) was suspended with  methanol:water (9:1, v/v, 300 mL) and then partitioned successively  with hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol (3 x 100 mL). The n-buta- nolic residue (2.0 g) was submitted to DCCC in descendent mode  yielding 33 fractions (180 mL). The solvent system employed was a  mixture of chloroform:methanol:water (43:37:20, v/v/v). Fractions 30  (60.0 mg) and 31 (85.0 mg) were subsequently purified by preparative  HPLC, using as eluent an isocratic mixture of methanol:water (47:53,  v/v), 5 mL min-1, column: Phenomenex Luna phenyl-hexyl (250 x  22 mm, 10 mm particle size) and UV detection at l 254 nm. This  procedure yielded the compounds 1 (12.0 mg, tR = 21.28 min), 2+3  (20.0 mg, tR = 28.61 min) and 4 (5.0 mg, tR = 31.53 min). The dried and powdered leaves (50.0 g) of O. elegans were sub- mitted to extraction with ethanol at room temperature (3 x 200 mL, 3  days). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue  (1.23 g) was suspended with methanol:water (9:1, v/v, 50 mL) and then  washed with hexane. The hydroalcoholic residue (1.0 g) was submitted  to silica gel (60-200 mm) CC, eluted with a gradient of hexane, ethyl  acetate and methanol affording 17 fractions (50 mL). The fraction 2  afforded compound 5 (8.0 mg). The fraction 15 (200 mg) was further  purified by preparative HPLC yielding compound 6 (120 mg, tR = 32.51  min). As eluent was used an isocratic mixture of water:acetonitrile (8:2,  v/v), 12 mL min-1, column: Phenomenex Luna phenyl-hexyl (250 x 22  mm, 10 mm particle size) and UV detection at l 254 nm. The dried and powdered leaves (250 g) of P. pyrifolia were  sequentially extracted with hexane and methanol at room tempe- rature (3 x 1000 mL, 3 days). The solvents were evaporated under  reduced pressure. The hexanic residue (8.0 g) was suspended with  methanol:water (9:1, v/v, 200 mL) and then washed with hexane. The  hydroalcoholic residue (1.0 g) was submitted to silica gel (60-200  mm) CC, eluted with a gradient of hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol  yielding 30 fractions (25 mL). The fractions 4-7 were pooled together  and furnished compound 7 (37.0 mg). Fractions 10 (90.0 mg) and 18  (80.0 mg) were purified by preparative HPLC. As eluent was used  an isocratic mixture of methanol:water (55:45, v/v), 12.0 mL min- 1, column: Phenomenex Luna C-18 (250 x 22 mm, 10 mm particle  size) and UV detection at l 254 nm. This procedure afforded the  compounds 8 (11.0 mg, tR = 35.05 min), 9 (3.0 mg, tR = 25.43 min)  and 10 (3.0 mg, tR = 52.86 min).  By a combination of spectroscopic methods (1H and 13C NMR  spectra) and comparison with the literature data, the compounds were  identified as follows: 4-O-E-caffeoylquinic acid methyl ester (1),15  quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucoside (2),16 quercetin-3-O- β-D-galactoside  (3),16 quercetin-3-O-β-D-xyloside (4),16 rel-(1R, 4S)-7-hydroxyca- lamenene (5),6 rel-(2R, 3R)-dihydroquercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnoside  (astilbin) (6),17 rel-(7S, 7’S, 8R, 8’R)-sesamin (7),18 rel-(7S, 7’S, 8R,  8’R)-methylpiperitol (8),18 rel-(7S, 7’S, 8R, 8’R)-eudesmin (9)18 and  rel-(7S, 7’S, 8R, 8’R)-magnolin (10).19 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The present study reports the isolation of one ester of the 4-O- E-caffeoylquinic acid (1), four flavonoids (2-4 and 6), one aromatic  sesquiterpene (5) and four furofuran lignans (7-10) from the leaves of  three Lauraceae species from the Cerrado region of São Paulo state,  Brazil (Figure 1). This is the first time that an aromatic sesquiterpene  and flavonoids are reported for O. elegans, flavonoids and an ester of  the 4-O-E-caffeoylquinic acid for O. corymbosa as well as furofuran  lignans for P. pyrifolia.  The sesquiterpene rel-(1R, 4S)-7-hydroxycalamenene (5) isolated  from O. elegans, has already been isolated from O. corymbosa.6  However, there are no reports regarding this compound on other  Lauraceae genera.  All the flavonoids isolated are derived from quercetin (2-4) and  dihydroquercetin (6) aglycones. This feature seems to be common  to other Lauraceae species likewise O. elegans and O. corymbosa. The furofuran lignans (7-10) isolated from P. pirifolia were  reported previously from Nectandra, Licaria, and Litsea species.20  This finding corroborates the importance of lignans and neolignans  as phytochemical constituents in Lauraceae species. The genera studied in this work encompass many species, which  are difficult to identify based just on morphological features.21  Mistakes in botanical identification could be prevented by using the  information obtained from a comprehensive analysis of the chemical  profiles of the putative species.
