Extraction  of Barr No. 65-191 gave similar results.  The present  report corroborates  the findings  of Higo et al.’ that A. eriocelztra yields no  easily crystallizable  homogeneous  sesquiterpene  lactone  components.  5,4’-Dihydroxy-3,7-  dimethoxyflavone  has previously  been isolated  from  an unnamed  new Beyeria  species,3  from Alpinia  Kumatake,4  A. japonica,5  Eucryphia  lucida,  Cistus ladanifera,7  Cheilanthes  farizosa’  and Larrea cuneifolia, g but not, to the best of our knowledge,  from a Composite.

I’  trla  I’  O O  N'  (IF)  The separation  of type III compounds  is notoriously  difficult,3*4 and only partial  separation of the crude C6Hs or EtOH extracts into sitosterol, a mixture, IIId and IV,  in order of increasing polarity, was achieved by silica column chromatography.  The  mixture was resolved by fractional crystallization from C6H, which gave pure IIIb in the  first crop. The residual material was fractionated by careful chromatography  on an alumina  column. Light petrol.-Et,0  eluted successively pure IIIa, pure 111~ and impure IIIb.  The structure of IIId was deduced from its PMR spectrum which was identical with the  spectra of IIIa, IIIb and 111~ with the exception, of course, of the signals due to the protons  and the substituents of the aromatic ring. The constitution  of this ring was established  through oxidation of IIId to veratric acid.  The absolute configuration  of the Piper products IIIa and IIIb is known.5 The ORD  curve of a sample of IIIb ex Piper methysticum Forster, kindly supplied by Prof. R. Hginsel,  Freie Universitgt Berlin, was superimposable on the analogous curves given by all type III  constituents of A. gigantifilia. The same (6S)-configuration  was consequently ascribed to  all of them.  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation ofthe constituents ofAniba gigantifolia. Powdered trunk wood (1.0 kg) was extracted successively  with CsHB and EtOH. The C6He extract (27.5 g), redissolved in a little C6HL, crystallized in the refrigerator.  The crystals (IIIb, 4.5 g) were separated  by filtration.  The filtrate was evaporated  and the residue was  chromatographed  on a column  of Merck’s Kieselgel 0.05-0,20 mm. C6Hs eluted sitosterol  (100 mg),  C6Hs-AcOEt,  9: 1 eluted a mixture (12 g), C6H6-AcOEt,  4: 1 eluted IIId (6.5 g) and AcOEt-MeOH,  19: 1  eluted IV (420 mg). The mixture was fractionally  crystallized from CsHs giving IIIb (9 g). The mother  liquor was rechromatographed  on a column of Merck’s alumina G. Light petrol.-Et*0  9:l eluted IIIa  (210 mg) and light petrol.-EtOz,  4: 1 eluted 111~ (150 mg). Other fractions contained mixtures of IIIa, IIIb  and 111~. The EtOH extract (21.8 g) was treated in the same way as the CsHb extract. IIIb (680 mg) crystal-  lized directly. Sitosterol (120 mg), IIIa + 111~ (380 mg), IIIb (730 mg), IIId (790 mg) and IV (1.5 g) were  obtained by chromatographic  techniques.  * Herbarium  specimen INPA (Manaus) 37397. The botanist W. Rodrigues,  to whom we are indebted  for the classification,  reports that A. gigantifoliu has previously only been located at the Tapaj6s river  (Par& State, Brasil) and in Peru. Near Manaus, where our specimen was collected, occurs A. hostmanniuna  (Nees) Mez, which differs from A. giguntifih  only with respect to the pillosity of the ovary, a fact which  makes distinction between the two species very difficult.  3 SAUER, H. and H~~NSEL, R.
