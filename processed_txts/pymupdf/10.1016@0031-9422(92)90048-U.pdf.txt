Abstract-From  the fruits and leaves of Trichilia hirta were isolated, besides sitosterol and sitostenone, two novel  limonoids:  methyl  11~-acetoxy-6-hydroxy-l2cc-(2-methylpropionyloxy)-3,7-dioxo-1,5,14,20,22-meliacapentaen-29-  oate and methyl 1 1~-acetoxy-6,23-dihydroxy-l2a-(2-methylpropionyloxy)-3,7,2l-trioxo-1,5,14,20-meliacatetraen-29-  oate. Three known protolimonoids,  melianone, melianodiol and bourjotinolone  A were also isolated. The limonoids  and protolimonoids  occurred only in the fruits, and sitostenone only in the leaves. Sitosterol occurred in both fruits  and leaves. All structures were established from spectral data.  INTRODUCTION  to a carboxyl group.

The IR spectrum of the hmonoid  3 presented  characteristic  absorptions  for hydroxyl  (3390 cm- ‘), ester carbonyl (1740 cm- ‘), and cc&non-  saturated  ketonic  carbonyl  (1680 cm- ‘) groups. The  mass spectrum showed a parent peak at m/z 594, which  toeether with ‘H and ‘%NMR  data allowed us to  pripose  the following elementary  formula C,,H,,O,e  for 3. The ‘HNMR  (Table 1) showed characteristic  signals of a /I-substituted  furan moiety (67.29, 7.13 and  6.21). Furthermore,  the presence of olefinic protons con-  jugated to a carbonyl (6 7.09 and 6.11, J = 10 Hz), corres-  ponded to H-l and H-2, respectively. The ‘H NMR still  showed the existence of four tertiary  methyl groups  characterized by the singlets (6 1.72, 1.66, 1.50 and 1.01).  The presence of only four signals corresponding  to  methyl groups suggested that one of the five methyls  commonly found in the hmonoids [2] should be oxidized  a’ OH  R’  R2  R3  I  CO,Me  OAc  OCOEt  2  CO,Me  OH  OCOEt  8  Me  H  H  *Permanent address: Departamento de Farmhcia e Bioquim-  ica, Universidade  Estadual de Maring& Maringi  PR, CEP  87020, Brazil.  625  626  D.

The r3C NMR obtained for 3 (Table 2),  fl  showed 32 signals, of which 10 corresponded  to C-sp2.  The presence of an epoxide group as occurs in cedrelone  [3] and hirtin Cl], was ruled out due to the absence of  signals between 669.8 and 55.1. On the other hand, one  0  45  double bond at C-14 was proposed, based on the signals  ‘.  5  (6 150.0 and 128.8) attributed to C-14 and C-15, respect-  OH  y-f+  ively. The presence of a 4/I-carbomethoxy  group at C-4  OH  was deduced from ‘H NMR. Furthermore, a very strong  correlation between the carbomethoxy group and the C-  HO  10 methyl was revealed from NOESY experiments [4]  -:  5 4  (Table 3). Several correlations  were confirmed by NOE  @  difference spectroscopy  through irradiation  at Me-19,  Me-28, CO,Me  and OAc signals frequencies, respect-  ively. A different relative configuration  based mainly on  the chemical shift of C-4 methyl has been proposed for  0  45  hirtin [S], a limonoid  very closely related to 3. The  6  stereochemistry  suggested for C-9, C-13 and C-17 is  based on the biosynthesis of limonoids [6]. However, for  \E”  C-11 and C-12 the small coupling constants between H-  11 and H-12 (J=4.7 Hz), and between H-l 1 and H-9  4  0  (J = 5.1 Hz) requires a trans-relationship  for these pro-  0  OH  tons [7]. This attribution  was confirmed  by ‘HP’H,  ‘H-‘3CCOSY  experiments [S]. The assignment of the  22‘  stereochemistry  and relative positioning  of the acetoxy  @  and isobutiroxy  groups was possible by NOESY ex-  periments (Table 3). A strong correlation  between the  carbomethoxy  and acetyl groups showed their cis rela-  tionship. This also determined the position C- 11 for the  0  %,  acetoxy group. From several 2D-experiments  it was  7  possible to attribute the chemical shifts for all protons  and carbons in the molecule.

Representative  long-range  ‘H-13C  couplings  are given in Table 4. Finally, structure  3 was proposed  for  this limonoid.  The complete  attribution  of all chemical  shifts for the carbons in ’ 3C NMR is found in the Table 2.  Cedrelone  (8) [3] was used as a model compound.  Compound  4 was very closely  related  to 3. Its IR  spectrum  was essentially  superimposable  on that of 3,  suggesting  the same functional  groups in the latter. The  mass spectrum  showed  the parent  peak m/z 626, which  when compared  with 3, indicated  the presence  of two  more oxygen atoms in 4. Therefore,  the combination  of  this data with those obtained  from 13CNMR  (Table 2)  suggested  the elementary  formula C,,H,,O,,.  The ana-  lysis of the ‘H NMR (Table l), revealed that the difference  between  compounds  3 and 4 was only in the furan ring.  For compound  4 instead  of a furan  unit, there  is a  y-hydroxybutirolactone  attached  to C-17. This unit was  confirmed  by ‘HNMR  (66.17 s) attributed  to H-23, and  by the diacetate  4a obtained  when 4 was acetylated;  the  ‘H NMR of 4a showed two extra peaks (62.16 and 2.08).  One  of these  signals  is attributed  to the diosphenol  Table  3.

Comparison of  the 13C MMR of 4 with nimocinolide [lo] showed clearly  that this compound has a 23-y-hydroxybutenolide  moiety  (6136.4, 169.8, 145.6 and 96.3) attributed  to C-20 and  C-23, respectively. The same argument can be used to rule  out the possibility that 4 is the isomer corresponding  to  isonimocinolide  [l 11. Based on the above evidence we  proposed structure 4 for this limonoid.  The three protolimonoids  were also identified from  their spectral data by comparison with the known com-  pounds melianone (5), melianodiol (6) [12] and bourjo-  tinolone  A (7) [13]. Melianone  and bourjotinolone  A  occurred as a mixture, which was separated only after  acetylation.  The limonoids we have isolated are slightly different  from those isolated by Taylor [ 1); however, they are very  typical compounds from the Meliaceae [14].  EXPERIMENTAL  General. NMR spectra were run at 25” using a 5 mm ‘H or 13C  probe with observations frequencies of200 and 50 MHz, respect-  ively. NOESY: shift correlations were performed using the pulse  sequence [S]; D1-9O”-D@90”-D9-90”-FID; pulse with ‘H (90”)  = 6.1 psec; proton relaxation delay (Dl) = 3 set; length of delay  D9 =0.4 set; number of experiments NE = 512; number of scans  NS = 120. lH-13C COSY long-range correlation: shift correla-  tion sequence [8, 91; proton relaxation delay (D1)=3 set; D3  and D4 values (0.071 set and 0.036 set respectively) were calcu-  lated using the observed three-bond coupling constant, ‘Jc-  = 7 Hz.

T. hirta was collected in Espirito  Santo, Brazil, and a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of  Institute de Bioci&ncias USP, Sao Paula. The CH,CI, extract  from fruits (11.82 g) was chromatographed  on silica gel eluting  with CH,CI,-EtOAc  (9: 1). The column yielded 10 frs which  were rechromatographed  in small columns affording pure com-  pounds. Fr. 4, gave 3 (43 mg), fr. 5,4 (23 mg) and sitosterol(6 mg).  Fr. 7 afforded bourjotinolone A (5 mg) and melianone (6 mg). Fr.  8 gave melianodiol  (89 mg), bourjotinolone  A (10 mg) and  melianone (8 mg). Fr. 9 yielded melianodiol(66 mg), bourjotinol-  one A (6 mg) and melianone (5 mg). Frs containing bourjotinol-  one and melianone, were first acetylated and the corresponding  acetates sepd by TLC. A petrol extract from leaves (9.09 g) using  the same procedure yielded sitosterol (158 mg) and sitostenone  (65 mg).  Limonoid 3. Yellowish viscous oil.
