Further-  more the spectrum shows three Me-singlets, a secondary  OCOMe  group  [dd 6 = 4.75(J = 2,2 Hz)],  the group  CH,C(Me)=CHC&OAc,  a methylene group (s(h) 4.91  md 5.10) as well as a further secondary nCHUR  group  Cdd4.43 (J = 2,2)].These data correspond with a bieyclic  diterpene with three O-functions.

Also the 13C NMR-  spectrum is in agreement with 1. The correlation  of the  signals could be achieved by an “o&esonance”-spectrum  and by using Yb(fod), as shift-reagent. The observed
