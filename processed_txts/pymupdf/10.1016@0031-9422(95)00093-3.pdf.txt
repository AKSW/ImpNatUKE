Abstract--The stems of Khaya senegalensis yielded three limonoids which appear to be novel. These compounds  were identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis as methyl lct,6,8a,14fl,3Ofl-pentahydroxy-3-oxo-  [3.3.1~°'2.1 ~'4]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate; methyl 1 t~,2fl,3ce,6,8a,14/3-hexahydroxy-[4.2.1 l°'3°.11'4]-tricyclomeliac-7-  oate and methyl ~c~-acet~xy-2~3a~6~8ct~4~-pentahydr~xy-[4.2.~°~3°.~1~4]-tri~yc~me~iac-7-~ate. The two latter  ones represent a novel group of methyl tricyclomeliac-7-oates. Scopoletin, scoparon, sitosterol, stigmasterol,  Campesterol and 3fl-O-fl-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol were also isolated.  INTRODUCTION  The genus Khaya A. Juss. is the main source of African  mahogany, and is closely related to the South American  genus Swietenia, the original source of mahogany.  Khaya senegalensis (Desr.) A. Juss occurs in the sub-  Saharan savannah area from Senegal to Uganda [1].  However, this was introduced in Brazil and showed  excellent growth. As part of a continuing study of the  chemosystematic of the Meliaceae we have now under-  taken a further investigation of stems of exotic K.  senegalensis. Here, we reported the isolation of three  new limonoids, two of which represent a no~el group of  methyl tricyclomeliac-7-oates.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  A dichloromethane-soluble fraction of the methanol  extract of the stems of K. senegalensis was purified by  repeated column chromatography on silica gel and  preparative  TLC  to  give  3fl-O-~-D-glucopyran-  osylsitosterol and three new limonoids 1, 2 and 3.  The major compound was identified as 1 on the basis  of the following data. The ~H NMR spectrum (Table 1)  indicated the presence of three tertiary methyl groups (8  0.99, 1.11 and 1.33), one methoxyl singlet (8 3.66),  three downfield shifted signals attributable to a t-  substituted furan ring (8 7.59, 7.56 and 6.47), three  signals characteristic of protons attached to a carbon  *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.  adjacent to an oxygen atom (8 5.40 s; 4.37 d, J=  10.3 Hz; 4.22 dd, J = 8.0 and 5.0 Hz) and two isolated  AB-type methylenes, suggesting the presence of a  methyl 1,29-cyclomeliacate skeleton [2-4]. From the  ~H-~3C long-range correlation spectrum (Table 2) the  observed correlations between the methyl proton at 8  0.99 and the 13C signals at 8 206.5 (3j) and 49.3 (2j)  led to their assignments as C-28, C-3 and C-4, respec-  tively. The methyl proton at 8 1.33 showed long-range  correlation with the ~3C signal at 8 83.6 (3j). The  oxymethine proton at 8 4.37 was coupled to the 1H  signal at 8 2.88 and both signals also showed cross  peaks with the ~C signal at 8 83.6 (3j and 2j,  respectively), so placing the secondary hydroxyl sub-  stituent at C-30 and a tertiary hydroxyl substituent at  C-I. The signals at 8 1.33 and 2.88 were then assigned  to C-19 and H-2, respectively. The oxymethine proton  at 8 4.22 showed one-bond correlation with the ~3C  signal at 8 70.0 and was coupled to the tH signal at 8  3.25, which showed long-range correlation with the C-4  signal (8 49.3) and the ~3C signal at 8 70.0, thus  indicating the hydroxyl group to be located at C-6 and  permitting the assignment of the signal at 8 3.25 to  H-5. A hydroxyl group must also be connected at C-8  due to the observed correlation between the H-2 signal  (8 2.88) and the 13C signal at 8 86.8. These correla-  tions resulted in the construction of a 1,6,8,30-tetrahy-  droxy-3-oxo-tricyclo-[3.3.11°'2.1 l'4]-decane system.  The large geminal coupling constant of the C-15  methylene protons was consistent with their situation a  to a carbonyl group with C-14 fully substituted. This  was supported by the long-range ~H-a3c COSY, which  831  832  L.R.V. O1~o et al.  Table 1.

Moreover, the existence of correlation  between the ~H signal at 8 5.40, assigned to H-17, and  the 13C signal at 8  141.5 (C-21) determined the  position of the furan ring at C-17. The ;H-tH and  one-bond 1H-13C COSY experiments suggested the  presence of an isolated structural unit, -CH-CH 2-  CH 2- in ring C (H-9, 8 2.28; 2H-11, 8 1.90 and  1.77-1.83; 2H-12, 8 1.77-1.83 and 0.85), since it was  the only location left in the nucleus.  The stereochemistry suggested for 1 was based on  the biosynthesis of limonoids [5]. However, for C-30  the stereochemistry has been assigned by chemical  conversions from known limonoids [2, 6]. In a compar-  able compound, xylocarpin (4), the stereochemistry of  the oxide was assigned by a study of the alkaline  hydrolysis and subsequent methylation [2]. Two prod-  ucts were obtained, one of which was 5, in which ,/2.3o  was 10 Hz (B 4.43 d, H- 30). Inspection of a model for  product 5 showed that after opening of the lactone ring,  it is possible for the alkoxyl ion produced at C-17 to  open an 8a,30a-oxide ring by attack at C-30, forming a  six-membered ether ring and an 8a-hydroxyl-group. A  similar attack is stereochemically impossible in a fl-  oxide. Thus, these observations allowed Okorie et al. to  suggest that, in xylocarpin, H-30 is fl and the oxide  ring a, in which J2.3o is 3 Hz [2].  Based on the above evidence, in compound 1 the  coupling constant between H-30 and H-2 (8 4.37 d,  J = 10.3 Hz)  is  characteristic  of  30fl-oxygenated  methyl meliacate derivatives, as in 5. A model shows  that, in 1 and 5, ring B is nearer to a boat than to a  Rearranged limonoids from Khaya senegalensis  Table 2. 1H-Iac LRCOSY for 1 and HMBC for la and 2  H  1  la  2  1,8  5  4,6  6  9  11/3  12fl  15a  16  15/3  16  17  21  18  13, 14  19  1, 10  21  22  21, 23  23  21  28  3, 4  29a  10  29b  1, 2,4  30  1  OMe  7  MeCO (8 2.17)  MeCO (8 2.10)  C  1,2,3,8,10  3,4,5,9, 10, 19  4, 5, 7, 10, Ac  5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19  10  18  14, 15, 16  16  13, 14, 16  16  13, 20, 21, 22, 18  18, 20, 21, 22  12, 13, 14, 17, 18  12, 13, 14  1,5,9,10,19  1,9,10  20, 22, 23  20, 22, 23  22, 23  20, 22  20, 22, 23  3, 4, 28, 29/5  4  1,2,3,4,28  1, 3, 10, 29/5  1  1,3,30  1  7, OMe  7, OMe  Ac, MeCO (8 21.0)  Ac, MeCO (8 21.9)  833  chair conformation, in which H-2 and H-30a are  eclipsed. For 1 this was supported by NOESY experi-  ments (Table 3), which showed correlations of the  signal of H-30a (8 4.37) with the signals of H-2 (8  2.88) and H-15fl (82.69). In addition, the signal of  H-15tz (8 3.10) showed cross peaks with the signal of  H3-18 (8 1.11), suggesting a spatial proximity of H-  15a to H3-18, which requires the hydroxyl group at  C-14 to be anti (fl) to H3-18 (a). The correlations from  H-17 (8 5.40), H-5 (8 3.25), H3-18 (8 1.11) and H-9 (8  2.28) to the signals at 8 1.77-1.83 permitted the  assignments of H-12fl (H-17fl and H-5fl--~H-12B)  and H-11t~ (H-9a and Mea-18-->H-11a) at 8 1.77-  1.83. Moreover, the existence of a correlation from  H3-19 (8 1.33) to the signal at 8 1.90, showed that this  signal can be attributed to H-11fl and thus the signal at  8 0.85 corresponds to H-12tz. All these correlations  require rings C and D nearer to chair conformations.  These conclusions were supported by several NOEDIF  experiments (Table 4). Moreover, the nOes of the  hydroxyl proton at 8 5.19, coming from H3-18 and  H-15a, allowed the assignment of this signal to 8-OH,  also showing that the hydroxyl group is thus in the  a-configuration. In the same way, the nOes of the  hydroxyl proton at 8 4.89, coming from H3-19 and  H-29b, show that this signal can be attributed to the  1 a-OH.  The assignment of the stereochemistry of C-30  received further support from acetylation of 1, which  yielded la. The ~H NMR spectrum of la (Table 1)  showed the downfield shift of the signal for H-6  (8 5.13), while the signal for H-30 was still visible as a  Table 3.

However, the 1H and ~3C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and  5) indicated the presence of two acetoxyl (8 c 169.4,  169.3 and ~ 2.10, 2.17). HMBC experiments with la  (Table 2) clearly showed correlations from H2-15 and  H3-18 to the C-14 signal at 8 83.5, from H-9 and H-2  to the C-8 signal at 8 87.6 and from H-2, 2H-29, H-30  and H3-19 to the 13C signal at 8 91.2, thus indicating  the second acetoxyl group to be located at C-1. This is  consistent with the stereochemistry for C-l, the least  hindered tertiary hydroxyl group of the molecule.  Approach of reagents appears to be accessible only  from the least hindered side of the molecule, since  Adesogan et al. also showed that acetylation of the  3/3,30t~-dihydroxymexicanolide derivative (6) (85.35 d,  J=3.6Hz,  H-30/~), catalysed by 4-dimethylamino-  pyridine, gave a 30-monoacetate, leaving the 3fl-hy-  droxyl-group unacylated [6].  As a further confirmation of the stereochemistry of 1,  a NOESY experiment was obtained for la (Table 3).  The  new  natural  product  is,  therefore,  methyl  1 t~, 6, 8ct, 14fl, 30fl-pentahydroxy-3-oxo-[3.3.1 lo.2.1 L4].  tricyclomeliac-7-oate (1). The structural assignment  was also supported by comparison of the ~3C NMR  spectrum with those of chukrasin A and mexicanolide  [7].  Compound 2 showed spectral characteristics close to  those of 1. The principal change observed in the ~3C  NMR spectrum (Table 5) of 2 was the replacement of  the resonance for a ketonic carbonyl by a signal for an  oxymethine (8 78.2). The ~H-~H COSY spectrum, in  addition to correlation between H-6 and H-5, revealed  two more oxymethine protons (8 4.28 and 3.21) which  Table 5. ~3C NMR chemical shift for 1, la, 2 and 3  C  1  la  2  3  1  83.6  91.2  83.5  91.1  2  62.7  59.6  72.3  72.0  3  206.5  204.0  78.2  78.1  4  49.3  52.1  42.7  44.1  5  41.9  40.7  40.8  39.1  6  70.0  72.7  71.4  71.5  7  173.6  170.1  175.1  175.1  8  86.8  87.6  86.6  86.8  9  54.6  57.3  55.3  55.9  10  59.3  62.0  59.2  60.9  11  16.2  16.5  16.4  16.4  12  26.3  25.6  25.9  26.0  13  36.9  37.5  37.1  37.5  14  83.0  83.5  80.7  81.5  15  33.1  32.4  32.3  32.0  16  169.9  169.7  170.5  170.3  17  80.2  79.9  80.1  80.5  18  14.6  14.2  14.5  14.4  19  18.3  20.5  18.6  18.1  20  120.7  120.4  121.3  120.6  21  141.5  141.1  143.2  142.6  22  110.4  110.1  110.5  110.1  23  143.3  143.0  141.2  140.9  28  15.3  15.6  19.7  19.3  29  44.3  40.8  45.3  41.1  30  74.5  74.0  63.1  58.7  OMe  51.6  52.4  51.4  52.2  OCOMe  169.4  170.4  OCOMe  169.3  OCOM.__.~e  21.9  22.0  OCOMe  21.0  I  13  1  13  Assignments based on H- C COSY/ H- C LRCOSY for I and HMQC/HMBC  and 2.  for la  Rearranged limonoids from Khaya senegalensis  835  were coupled to each other and only one (6 4.28) to a  methine proton (6 2.48). These observations could not  be explained by the presence of hydroxyl groups at  C-3 and C-30, indicating that we were not dealing  with a normal 1,3,30-trihydroxy-l,29-cyclomeliacate  skeleton, tficyclo-[3.3.11o.2.1 l'4]-decane system. A  pinacol pinacolone rearrangement of a 2,30-dihydroxy-  3-oxo-l,29-cyclomeliacate precursor and subsequent  reduction may have occurred, resulting in a tricyclo-  [4.2.11°'3°.1L4]-decane  as in 2, whose spectroscopic  properties accord with the above data. The signals at 6  4.28, 3.21 and 2.48 were then assigned to H-2, H-3 and  H-30, respectively. The NOESY experiments (Table 3)  showed correlations between H-30 and 2H-15 (6 2.86,  H-15a, a weak, but definite correlation; 2.63, H-15fl).  This implies that the bridge-head proton and 2H-15 are  close to each other in space and demonstrate that  the  tricyclo  is  [4.2.11o.3o.1 L4]-decane  and  not  [3.3.11°'2.11A]-decane, since in 1 these protons are not  close.  The NOESY experiments also showed correlations of  H-5 with H-3 and of H-30 with H-2, which require a  trans-relationship for H-3 and H-2, with H-3 on the  t-side and H-2 on the a-side of the molecule. This is  consistent with the coupling constants between H-3 and  H-2 (J = 7.2), and between H-2 and H-30 (J = 9.2), in  which the rearranged six-ring is nearer to a boat  conformation where H-2 and H-30 must be eclipsed.  Moreover, the observed correlations of H-21 and H-17  and H3-18, and H-23 with H-22, were very similar to  those of 1 and la, except that H-23 (6 7.62) is more  deshielded than H-21 (6 7.58). In the same way,  HMQC experiments showed that C-21 (6 143.2) is  more deshielded that C-23 (6 141.2). The structure of  the new natural product was thus established as methyl  1 a,2fl, 3a,6, 8t~, 14fl- hexahydroxy- [4.2.11°"3°.11'4]- tfi-  cyclomeliac-7-oate (2). The third compound exhibited  similar NMR spectra to 2 (Tables 1 and 5) except for  the presence of a tertiary acetoxyl (6 c 170.4, 22.0 and  6 n 1.97). Significant upfield shifts for C-29 and C-30 in  the 13C NMR spectrum, when compared with 2 and la,  determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-1. Thus,  the structure of the new limonoid was characterized as  methyl  la-acetoxy  2fl,3a,6,8a,14fl-pentahydroxy-  [4.2.11o.3o. 1 l'4]-tficyclomeliac-7-oate (3).  The dichloromethane extract from the stem of K.  senegalensis gave a mixture of sterols and two  coumarins, which were identified by comparison with  published data as scopoletin and scoparon [8]. The  mixture of sterols was acetylated and analysed by  GC-mass spectrometry, which established that the  sterols were sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol.  As reported in previous papers [5, 9] species of  Khaya explore limonoid chemistry along only one  route, which leads to the mexicanolide group, bicyclo-  [3.3.11°'2]-nonane system. This appears to be the first  record of limonoids with a tficyclo-[3.3.11°'2.11'4]-de-  cane system from Khaya, while 2 and 3 represent  further enlargement of the biosynthetic mexicanolide-  pathways.

Isolation of compounds. Ground stems (600 g) was  extracted with hexane, then CH2C12 and finally with  MeOH. The conc. CH2CI 2 extract was submitted to  vacuum chromatography over silica gel using a  hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH  gradient. Frs  1-3  gave a mixt. of sterols, fr. 5 gave scoparon (17 mg) and  ft. 6 gave scopoletin (20rag). The coumarins were  purified by prep. TLC (silica gel, EtOAc-hexane, 3 : 2).  The mixt. of sterols was acetylated with Ac20-  pyridine prior to analysis by low resolution GC-MS,  which established that the sterols were sitosterol,  stigmasterol and campesterol. The conc. MeOH extract  was partitioned into CH2C12-, EtOAc- and n-BuOH-  soluble frs. The conc. CH2CI 2 extract was subjected to  CC over silica gel. Elution with a hexane-CH2C12-  EtOAc-MeOH gradient afforded a mixt. of limonoids  and 3 fl-O-fl-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol (40mg). The  mixt. of limonoids was repeatedly chromatographed on  silica gel (hexane-EtOAc-MeOH gradient; hexane-  CHzCI2-MeOH, 2: 18: 1) yielding, after final purifica-  tion by TLC (hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 4:16:1), com-  pounds 1 (70mg), 2 (17 mg) and 3 (5 mg).
