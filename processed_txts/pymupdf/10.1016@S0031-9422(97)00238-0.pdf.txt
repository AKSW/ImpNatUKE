Abstract--The leaves of Tocoyena,/ormosa afforded two antifungal iridoids, ~- and fl-gardiol, and the new  iridoids, mollugoside methyl ester and formosinoside.

Shun, a small  ornamental tree growing in dry regions of Central  Brazil, is commonly known as 'genipapo do campo'  and has very impressive yellow-green flowers [1]. In  the course of our continuing search for bioactive con-  stituents from rubiaceous species that grow in 'Cer-  rado Regions' of Brazil [2-4], we investigated the ethyl  acetate-soluble fraction of the 60% aqueous ethanol  extract of leaves of T. Jormosa. In our mechanism-  based bioassay for potential anticancer agents uti-  lizing genetically-engineered yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae) strains [5], this extract exhibited moderate  and nonselective activity on all the mutant strains  tested suggesting the presence of antifungal agents  rather than potential anticancer agents. Subsequent  confirmation of its antifungal activity using Cla-  dosporium cladosporioides and C. esphaerospermum [6]  followed by bioassay-guided fractionation afforded  four iridoids 1-4. Of these, ~-gardiol (1) and fl-gardiol  (2) which were obtained as an inseparable mixture [7]  exhibited antifungal activity. The third iridoid, mol-  lugoside methyl ester (3), is being described here for  the first time from a natural source. The fourth iridoid  found to be new and hence named formosinoside (4),  was characterized as its hexaacetate derivative (5).  This paper deals with the structure elucidation of 5  and the antifungal activities of 1 and 2.

The ethyl acetate fraction on silica gel  chromatography afforded three pure compounds  identified as ~-gardiol (1), fl-gardiol (2) [5] (see Experi-  mental) and mollugoside methyl ester (3) [8], and an  inseparable mixture (3 : 1) of two compounds. These  two compounds which were suspected to be isomers  from NMR spectra of the mixture were separated via  their peracetates to obtain the hexaacetate (5) c,f the  major compound (4). Besides the iridoids, the ethyl  esters of ferulic and caffeic acids were also isolated.  Both are probably artifacts of aqueous ethanol extrac-  tion.

The ~3C NMR spectrum was recorded in CDCI3 at  50 and 100 MHz.  b Multiplicities were based in DEPT-135 experiment, assignments were based on HETCOR. ~Assignments from tH-~H  COSY-45 experiment.  and a carboxylic acid group (3378 and 1695 cm-~).  The ~H NMR spectrum of 5 (Table 1) exhibited the  presence of two olefinic protons at 8 5.55 and 8 5.80  (each 1H, dd, J = 6.0; 1.5 Hz, H-7 and dd, J = 6.0;  2.0 Hz, H-6). In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum  showed signals at 8 5.00 (1H, d, J = 5.8 Hz), 8 5.92  (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz), 3 4.22 and 4.90 (2H, dd, J = 11.0;  8.0 and 11.0; 3.0 Hz), which were attributed to protons  at C-l, C-3 and C-10, respectively. The remaining  doublet at 8 5.93 (1H, J  =  8.0 Hz) could be assigned  to the anomeric proton from sugar moiety present in  the molecule of 5. The ~H NMR also supported the  presence of six acetyl groups as broad signals at 8 1.98  (corresponding two acetyl groups), 2.01, 2.02, 2.05  and 2.09. The 13C NMR of 5 (Table 1) showed signals  due to two olefinic carbons at 8 134.62 and 136.57; a  hexopyranose moiety (6 99.28, 76.08, 74.10, 73.70,  69.08 and 65.01); six acetyl groups; two hemiacetalic  carbons at 8 91.52 and 98.06 and one --CH2-- carbon  at 6 67.18. Detailed analysis of chemical shifts, with  the aid of 2D NMR, mainly IH-~H COSY spectrum  led us to suggest that this compound also had an  iridoidal structure. It could belong to a structural type  quite close to apodantheroside [9] with a double bond  between C-6, C-7 and hydroxyl function at C-10. By  assuming a iridoidal skeleton, and by comparison with  carbon assignments of known iridoids, it was possible  to assign the carboxyl group (8 180.29 s) to C-11. The  structure of the iridoidal aglycone and the position  of glycosidic linkage of 5 were further elucidated, as  follows, by an extensive use of 2D NMR methods  (1HJH COSY, HETCOR and COLOC). By COSY  correlation it was possible to observe that a doublet  at 6 5.00 (J = 5.8 Hz) was coupled to a double doublet  at 3 3.00 (J = 9.0; 5.8 Hz) and a doublet at 6 5.92  coupled to a double doublet at 6 2.98 (J = 7.6; 2.0  Hz). In addition, the COSY-45 spectrum showed that  the olefinic methine H-7 at 3 5.55 was correlated with  methine H-8 at 3 3.08 (J = 9.0; 1.5 Hz); and an ABX  system at 8 4.22 (J = 11.0; 8.0 Hz) and 4.90 (J = 11.0;  3.0 Hz) were due to the hydroxymethylene H-10. The  HETCOR spectrum of 5 revealed that the methine at  6 99.28 was correlated with H-I' (8 5.93 d), wlhile the  signal at 3 98.06 was correlated with H-1 (6:5.00 at).  The correlations between methines 6 91.52 and H-3 (6  5.92 d); 3 46.56 and H-4 (8 2.98 dd); 3 42.44 and H-5  (3 3.53 ddd); 3 39.42 and H-8 (6 3.08 dd); 6 42.28 and  H-9 (6 3.00 dd) were also confirmed. The COLOC  spectrum (see Table 1) further confirmed the proposed  structure and allowed unequivocal assignment of all  ~H and ~3C NMR signals. NOE experiments per-  formed on compound 5, dissolved in CDCI3, con-  firmed the stereochemical assumptions on the relative  orientation  of  acetoxyl,  carboxyl  and  hyd-  roxymethylene groups and permitted the assignment  of the overall relative stereochemistry of the molecule  Iridoids from Tocoyenaformosa  AcO "v  ~  ~  2~'H  x  Y._X)  Fig. 1  as in Fig. 1. Particularly, irradiation of the signal for  9fl-H at 6 3.00 produced significant enhancement of  the H-10 (~20%) methylene and methine 5fl-H  (~35%). Furthermore, irradiation of I~-H showed  simultaneous enhancement of the signals at 8a-H  (12%) and 3ct-H (15%). These findings suggest that  the acetoxyl group at C-3 and the hydroxymethylene  at C-8 are in fl disposition.  From iridoids derivatives isolated from T. formosa  only the epimeric mixture of a- and fl-gardiol showed  antifungal activity (Table 2). The fungitoxic properties  of some iridoidal aglycones have already been  observed in the case of Alibertia macrophylla [4] and  seem to be an interesting feature of Rubiaceae growing  in 'Cerrado Regions'.

Leaves of Tocoyena formosa were  collected in the Esta~o Ecol6gica e Experimental de  Mogi-Guagti, S~o Paulo State, Brazil in July 1991 by  Dr M. C. M. Young and identified by Dr S. L. J.  Mendagolli, Instituto de Botgnica de Sgo Paulo. A  voucher specimen (SP1787979) has been deposited in  the Herbarium of Instituto de Bot~nica de Sgo Paulo,  Brazil.  Bioloyical screening procedures. The experimental  methods utilized in the screening procedures with S.  cerevisiae mutants [5] and C. cladosporioides [6] have  307  been described elsewhere. The procedure used for C.  esphaerospermum was similar to that of C. cla-  dosporioides.  Extraction and isolation. Air-dried and powdered  leaves (800 g) of 1".formosa were extracted with 60%  aq. EtOH. The resulting extract was concd to half its  original vol. and extracted with hexane followed by  EtOAc. Evapn afforded hexane (3.00 g) and EtOAc  (5.5 g) extracts. The EtOAc fr. was submitted to CC  on silica gel and eluted with mixts of CHCI:~ and  MeOH. A total of 28 frs were collected. Frs 9-11 were  further purified by prep. TLC [silica gel, C6H6EtOAc  (2:3) containing 3% HOAc] yielding an epimeric mixt.  of 1 and 2 (42.5 mg) [5] and ethyl ferulate (19.4 mg).  Frs 12-14 yielded, after prep. TLC (as described for 9-  11) ethyl caffeoate (20 mg). Mollugoside methylester 3  (40 nag) [8] was isolated by prep. TLC [silica gel, C6H6-  EtOAc (1:1)+1.5% HOAc], after purification of  fr. 15.  Fractions 17 18 were purified by prep. TLC isilica  gel, EtOAc-MeOH H:O (77:15:8). TLC and ~H  NMR investigations of this purification indicated that  the resulting fr. was of interest and looked to be con-  stituted of only one product. However, 13C NMR of  this compound indicated an inseparable mixt. (3: 1)  which was subjected to acetylation (Ac20/pyr. 25 °, 12  Hs). The acetyl derivatives obtained, were subjected  to prep. TLC (silica gel, CH2CI~EtOAc (2:3)+1%  HOAc), which afforded the major compound 5 (23  mg).  Formosinoside-l-hexaacetate  (5).  Amorphous  powder, mp 144~146 °, [:~]D = + 36.1 ° (CHCI~, c 3.17).
