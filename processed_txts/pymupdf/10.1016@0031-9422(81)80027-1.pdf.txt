Abstract-Five  amides were isolated from the roots of Ottonia corcouadensis. Two are the known piperlonguminine  and  piperovatine. The other three are new and their structures are: (2Z,4Z)-N-isobutyl-5-(3,4_methylenedioxyphenyl)-  penta-2,4-dienoic  amide for isopiperlonguminine;  (2E,4E)-N-(2-methyl-2-acetoxypropyl)-5-(3,4-methylenedioxy-  phenyl)-penta-2,4-dienoic  amide  for  corcovadine;  and  (22,4Z)-N-(2-methyl-2-acetoxypropyl)-5-(3,4-methy-  lenedioxyphenyl)~penta-2,4-dienoic  amide for isocorcovadine.  INTRODUCTION  Ottonia corcovadensis Miq., a herbaceous shrub of the  Piperaceae, is known in Brazilian folk medicine under the  name of ‘false jaborandi’.* Its roots and, to a lesser extent,  the stems are chewed to alleviate toothache, due to their  anesthetic  action  on the mucous  membranes  of the  mouth. Extraction of the roots with petrol followed by  extensive column chromatography  yielded five amides.  Piperlonguminine  (1) and piperovatine (5) were identified  by  direct  comparison  with  authentic  samples.  Piperovatine  is the sole substance responsible for the  anesthetic  activity  and  was  obtained  pure  by  crystallization  in  a  system  of  solvents  at  low  temperature. The remaining three amides are new, having  been named isopiperlonguminine  (2), corcovadine (3) and  isocorcovadine  (4). Piperlonguminine-isopiperlongu-  minine and corcovadine-isocorcovadine  are shown to be  pairs of cis-tram  isomers.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The work was performed with two batches of roots of 0.  corcouadensis collected at the same site with a 1 year  interval. Different extraction procedures were applied to  the two batches. In the first process the ground roots were  extracted exhaustively with petrol at room temperature;  the resulting oily extract was fractionated on a column of  silica gel and fractions eluted with solvents of increasing  polarity. Piperlonguminine  (1) and corcovadine (3) were  isolated in this way. With the second batch, extraction was  done in a Soxhlet, the extract being chromatographed  repeatedly  on a series of silica gel columns. By this  procedure, all five amides could be isolated. Separation on  silica gel proved to be effective, although  extremely  delicate due to the closeness of the bands. All five amides  were eluted with hexane-EtOAc  mixtures of composition  close to 7:3, thus calling for frequent rechromatography  of  *Not to be confused with the genuine jaborandi, comprising  several Pilocarpus species (family Rutaccae), the source of  pilocarpine and other alkaloids.  = CH-CH  =CH-CONHCH,CHMe,  1  tram-2-tram-4  2  cis-2-cis-4  CH = CH-CH  = CHCONHCH,CMe,OR  3  tram-2-truns-4, R = AC  4  cis-2-cis-4, R = AC  6  trans-2-truns-4, R = H  -5  :I  CH,CH = CH-CH = CHCONHCH,CHMe,  Me0  5  the fractions.  Most  difficult  to isolate  pure  was  piperovatine (5). Its presence was monitored through the  procedure by means of its anesthetizing  action on the  tongue. Several attempts to purify the active fractions  were unsuccessful  due mainly  to their pronounced  tendency to darken. The final purification was achieved  again through chromatography  on a silica gel column and  elution with mixtures of hexane and EtOAc. At the end,  the compound crystallized after being kept for 11 weeks at  - 5”.  The pair piperlonguminine-isopiperlonguminine  Piperlonguminine  (I), the isobutylamide of trans,trans-  piperic acid, was originally isolated from the roots ofPiper  longum  [l 1. Isopiperlonguminine  (2), C,,H,,O,N,  1305  1306  S. S. COSTA and W. B. MORS  crystals,  mp  l&143”,  is herewith  described  as the  corresponding  cis,cis isomer.  The mass spectra  of the  compounds  are identical;  IR and UV spectra are similar.  The IR spectra differ notably  at 985 cm-‘,  where only 1  shows  a strong  absorption  peak  due  to the  tram  configuration.  Comparison  of the UV spectra  shows  essentially  a hypsochromic  shift of the main absorption  band, of the order of 10 nm. Significant  differences appear  in the ‘H NMR spectra, where signals in the region of the  olefinic protons  appear much less complex for 2 than for 1  (see Table 1).  The positions  of the signals agree with those reported  for synthetic  cis,cis-piperic  acid  [2] and  for cis,cis-  piperine  (chavicine)  [3].  Doubts  about  the  precise  assignments  for protons  B and C [3] could be dispelled  with the aid of the ‘spin tickling’  technique  of double  resonance.  Irradiating  the proton  corresponding  to the  most upfield signal (HA, d 5.69, d, J = 11 Hz) determines  splitting of the signal at d 6.85 (t, J = 11 Hz), which must  therefore be assigned to Ha. Conversely,  irradiation  of the  most downfield  signal (presumably  the deshielded  H,,  (6 7.45, t, J = 11 Hz) determines  splitting of two signals, as  would have to be expected,  one being due to H, (already  identified)  and the other one H, (S 4.66, d, J = 11 Hz).  The  observed  differences  between  the spectra  of the  isomers  with  respect  to the protons  fl to the amide  carbonyl  group  are  consistent  in that  the  uniform  shielding in the trarqtrans structures  suffers a deshielding  effect in the cis,cis structures.  The pair corcovadine-isocorcovadine  Corcovadine  (3), C,,H,,O,N,  crystals, mp 141-144”,  exhibits  the typical  UV absorptions  of a piperic  acid  derivative  (see Experimental).  The IR spectrum  is similar  to that of piperlonguminine  with respect  to the amide  function  (v,,, 3225 and 1640 cm- I), the trans configura-  tion of the olefinic double  bonds  (lOOOcm_ ‘) and the  methylenedioxy  group  (925 cm - ‘). A second  carbonyl  function is revealed by a strong absorption  at 1710 cm - I,  which can be attributed  to the presence  of an acetoxy  group. The ‘H NMR spectrum  also very much resembles  that of piperlonguminine  with respect to the piperic acid  moiety  (see Table 1). In addition,  there are signals for  geminal  methyl  groups  (6H,  s) at S 1.46; methylene  protons  (2H, d, J = 6Hz)  at 5 3.59, coupled  with the  proton  at the nitrogen  (1 H, br.), at 6 6.23. A single signal  (3H, s) at 62.02 is again indicative  of an acetoxy group,  which was also confirmed  by the mass spectrum:  with a  fragmentation  pattern  similar  to that  of piperlongu-  minine, it shows an additional  significant  peak at m/z 271  (M + - 60; 14 y’,), corresponding  to the loss of one acetic  acid molecule  from the molecular  ion. Other fragments  were typical of amides derived from piperic acid. On the  basis  of  these  data,  structure  3 was  assigned  to  corcovadine.  Chemical  confirmation  was  obtained  through  alkaline hydrolysis,  producing  the amide 6, with  a tertiary  hydroxyl  group, and piperic acid.  Spectral comparisons  analogous  to those discussed for  piperlonguminine  and isopiperlonguminine  allowed for  correlation  of  corcovadine  (3)  with  its  isomer,  isocorcovadine  (4), C,,H,  ,05N, crystals, mp 80-85”. The  absence, in the IR spectrum  of the latter, of an absorption  in the region of 970-990cm  -’ points to the absence  of  double  bonds  in  a  trans configuration.  The  cis  configuration  receives support from similarities in the UV  and ‘H NMR spectra to those of isopiperlonguminine  (2)  (see  Table  1 and  Experimental).  Mass  spectral  fragmentations  of 3 and 4 are identical.  EXPERIMENTAL  Mps were determined on a Kofler hot stage and are uncorr.  UV spectra were obtained in MeOH and IR spectra in KBr  unless otherwise stated. ‘HNMR  spectra were measured at  100MHz  and  MS at 70eV.  Column  chromatography  was  performed  on Si gel, and TLC on Si gel H and GF,,,  (Merck).  The identity of compounds,  whenever stated, was established  by  direct  comparison  with authentic  samples  through  mp, mmp,  UV, IR, ‘HNMR  and MS, as well as TLC.  Plant material. Two batches of 0. corcovadensis were collected  at the hillside of the Corcovado  Mountain  in Rio de Janeiro,  in  December,  at a 1 year interval.

The dried, powdered roots  (1600g) were exhaustively extracted by maceration with petrol.  The combined extracts (22 1.) were coned under red. pres. to give a  dark green viscous mass (7.7Og). The material was treated with  Me,CO and the soluble portion was again evapd to dryness  under  red.  pres.  The  dark  oily  residue  (5.86g)  was  cbromatographed on a Si gel column (350g) and developed with  solvent mixtures of increasing polarity. Toluene-EtOAc  (19: 1)  eluted piperlongumine (1, 36 mg). Elution with toluene-EtOAc  9:l and 4:l afforded fractions which were combined and  submitted to the same procedure. Repeated chromatography  followed  by five recrystallizations  from  MeOH  yielded  corcovadine  (3, 58mg). Although these last fractions were  strongly anesthetizing to the tongue, separation of the active  material could not be achieved.  Extraction  and separation II. The dried, powdered roots  (19OOg) were extracted with petrol in a Soxhlet until the extract  was clear (72 hr.) The filtered extract was coned under red. pres.,  yielding a dark green viscous oil (22g). The material was  chromatographed  on a column of Si gel (300g) and developed  first with hexane, followed by solvent mixtures of increasing  polarity, through toluene, EtOAc and MeOH. This procedure  resulted in the separation of four crude fractions, of which only  one, the one eluted with EtOAc, showed anesthetic activity. The  fractions were repeatedly rechromatographed,  monitoring the  procedure by means of TLC. In this, visualization of all the  compounds in UV light was very helpful: the tram compounds  showed intense, blue fluorescence, while the cis compounds were  detached from the background as dark spots. Eventually, all five  amides were separated in this way. Solvents for crystallization  were: toluene for piperlonguminine;  hexane-EtOAc  (2:l) for  isopiperlonguminine;  MeOH for corcovadine; hexane-EtOAc  (4:l) for isocorcovadine;  MeOH for piperovatine. All were  obtained as colourless crystals.  Piperionguminine (1). Mp 167-169” (lit. [l ] 166-168”). IR  v,,,cm-‘:  3280, 1640,1615,1550, 1495, 1470, 1430,1360,1240,  1185, 1030, 985, 920, 850.
