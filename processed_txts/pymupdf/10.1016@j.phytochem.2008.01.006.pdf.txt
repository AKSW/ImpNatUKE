The structures of all compounds were elucidated primarily from 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses, as well as by high resolution mass spectrometry. All ﬂavonols were screened to identify secondary metabolites as potential myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitors, and at concentrations of 0.50–50 nM, quer- cetin (5), isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7) exhibited strong inhibitory eﬀects with IC50 values of 1.22 ± 0.01, 3.75 ± 0.02 and 3.60 ± 0.02, respectively. The MPO activity detected for the new derivative 1 was markedly decreased (IC50 10.3 ± 0.03) when compared with known ﬂavonols 5–7, and interestingly increased when tested against ABTS scavenging activity. � 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-enzyme present in human neutrophils and plays a role in infection and inﬂam- mation, converting hydrogen peroxide and chloride to hypochlorous acid and water (Winterbourn et al., 2000). Although hypochlorous acid has important roles in killing microorganisms, it also possesses high reactivity and the ability to damage macromolecules by oxidation (Teixeira et al., 2003). The excessive MPO activity and reactive oxy- gen species (ROS), especially HOCl, production are impli- cated in many inﬂammatory processes (Heinecke et al., 1993; Gurel et al., 2004), including atherosclerosis, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease; the search for new myeloperoxi- dase inhibitors from natural sources has become a staple in drug discovery. Pterogyne nitens (Fabaceae) is popularly named in Bra- zil as ‘‘tipa´”, ‘‘viraro´”, ‘‘cocal”, ‘‘amendoinzeiro”, ‘‘amen- doim-bravo”, according to the region where this plant grows. It is a beautiful legume tree, and the sole member of the genus Pterogyne, which is distributed mainly in Bra- zil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, and can reach a height of 5–12 m. (Burkart, 1952). Its wood is also widely 0031-9422/$ - see front matter � 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. doi:10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.01.006 * Corresponding author. Tel.: +55 16 33016660; fax: +55 16 33227932.

Our previous studies on P. nitens have resulted in the isolation of ﬂavones, and ﬁve guanidine alkaloids, which exhibited selective activity towards a DNA repair-deﬁcient strain of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting poten- tial anti-cancer activity (Bolzani et al., 1995). In our contin- uing interest in searching for new biologically active metabolites from plants of the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest regions, we have investigated the fruits of this plant, col- lected at the Botanical Garden, Sa˜o Paulo, in May 2003. We report herein the isolation, and structural elucidation of one new ﬂavonol rhamnoside, namely pterogynoside (1) and six known ﬂavonols: kaempferol (Mitscher et al., 1985), afzelin (Salama et al., 1981), kaempferitrin (Pizzolat- ti et al., 2003), quercetin, isoquercitrin and rutin (Markham et al., 1978). Additionally, these compounds were screened for MPO inhibitory activity, using a guaiacol oxidation method (Capeille`re-Blandin, 1998). The new ﬂavonol 1 was also analyzed for the scavenging of DPPH and ABTS free radicals activities and its antioxidant potential was evaluated (see Fig. 1). 2. Results and discussion Shade-dried, powdered fruits of P. nitens were ﬁrst defatted with n-hexane and exhaustively extracted by re- maceration with ethanol. The solvent was evaporated at low temperature under reduced pressure to yield a syrup which was suspended in methanol–water (4:1) and then successively partitioned with ethyl acetate and n-butyl alco- hol. The resulting fractions were subjected to successive column chromatography separation steps to yield ptero- gynoside (1) along with six known ﬂavonols. Pterogynoside (1) was isolated as yellow prisms, m.p. 272–273 �C, and gave a positive reaction with ferric chlo- ride, indicating it as a phenol derivative. The IR spectrum exhibited strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydro- xyl (3280 cm�1), chelated hydroxy group (3265 cm�1), con- jugated ester (1695 cm�1), conjugated ketone (1650 cm�1) and aromatic C@C absorptions (1612, 1593, 1550 and 1508 cm�1). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions (kmax) (loge) at 316 (4.53) and 297 (4.29), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a ﬂavonol struc- ture (Mabry et al., 1970; Agrawal et al., 1989). The UV spectra recorded in EtOH and shift reagents such as KOH, NaOAc and AlCl3 suggested the presence of free hydroxy groups at C-40, C-7 and C-5, respectively. Its ele- mental composition C29H26O14, with 17� of unsaturation, was deduced from its HRESIMS, which showed a deproto- nated molecular ion ([M�H]�) at m/z 597.5087 (calcd for C29H26O14, 597.5081) consistent with its 13C NMR data (Table 1, Supporting Information). The CID (collision induced dissociation) experiments using the product ion scan mode (MS2) allowed characterization and establish- ment of the fragmentation pathway of pterogynoside, with an intense (64%) kaempferol peak at m/z 285 in the nega- tive ion mode. The positive ion mode also gave an intense kaempferol peak at m/z 287. Further MS analysis showed a deprotonated ion peak at m/z 597, and a product ion at m/z 431 indicating the presence of one hexose residue in com- pound 1.

Regasini et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 1739–1744 denced the presence of a 5,7,400- trisubstituted ﬂavonol moi- ety, in addition to 4000-methylgallate and a-L-rhamnopyr- anosyl residues. The assignment of all proton and carbon signals followed from extensive analysis of 1H–1H gCOSY, gHMQC, and gHMBC spectra (Table 1). The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 presented 29 carbons deduced from DEPT 90�, DEPT 135� and gHMQC techniques as one methyl, thirteen methines, one methoxyl and fourteen quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at d 167.7 and d 179.5, attributed to ester and ketone groups, respectively. The 1H NMR and 1H–1H gCOSY spectra (Table 1) showed an A2M2 spin system assigned to the hydrogen sig- nals at d 7.74 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H-200, 60) and 6.87 (2H, d, J = 9.0 Hz, H-30, 50) attributed to a 1,4-disubstituted aro- matic ring; and a pair of doublets at d 6.10 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-6) and 6.29 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-8) for the trioxygenated A ring of compound 1, suggesting a kaempferol moiety for its aglycone. Additionally, the 1H NMR resonances at d 5.38 and 0.89 evidenced an a- rhamnopyranosyl moiety, which was conﬁrmed by obser- vation of correlated signals at d 103.6, d and d 17.7 in the HMQC spectrum. A cross-peak between the signals for C-3 (d136.0) and the anomeric hydrogen H-100 (d 5.38) in the gHMBC spectrum indicated the position of the rhamnosyl unit at C-3 of the kaempferol moiety. Further analysis of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data (Table 1) indicated an additional methylgallate unit in compound 1, which was placed at C-300 of the rhamnopyranosyl moi- ety due to the downﬁeld chemical shift observed for H-300 (d 5.11), and a gHMBC cross-peak of H-300 with the car- bonyl ester C-7000 (d 167.7). An additional gHMBC correla- tion was observed between the signal at d 141.2 (C-4000) and d 3.77 (OMe) which conﬁrmed the position of the methoxy group at C-4000. Hence, the structure of pterogynoside (1) was completely elucidated, and established as kaempfer- ol-3-O-(300-O-4000-methylgallate-a-L-rhamnoside. Addition- ally, six known ﬂavonols were isolated and identiﬁed as kaempferol (2) (Mitscher et al., 1985), afzelin (3) (Salama et al., 1981), kaempferitrin (4) (Pizzolatti et al., 2003), quer- cetin (5), isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7) (Markham et al., 1978). Their identiﬁcation was based on analyses of 1H, 13C NMR and MS data, as well as by comparison with authentic material available in our laboratory. Furthermore, this is the ﬁrst report of ﬂavonol glycosides from P. nitens. Although a broad spectrum of biological activities has already been demonstrated for ﬂavonoids (Middleton et al., 2000; Cuzzocrea et al., 2001; Havsteen, 2002; Mol- lace et al., 2005), few studies have been devoted to the mye- loperoxidase inhibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols (Kato et al., 2003). Myeloperoxidase production is triggered by inﬂamma- tory mediators resulting in acceleration of superoxide anion (O� 2 ) conversion to hydrogen peroxide an other ROS especially HOCl, which reacts further to generate sin- glet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (HO�) as powerful oxidizing agents. Such species are involved in oxidative stress-related diseases as atherosclerosis, cancer, Alzheimer disease etc., which evidences the importance of research towards new MPO inhibitors. All isolates were assayed for their MPO inhibitory activ- ity (Table 2), evidencing a key role of the B ring oxygena- tion pattern on the level of activity. Compounds 5–7, presenting a catechol derived B-ring, exhibited IC50 values of 1.22, 3.75 and 3.60 nM, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds 1–4, which are kaempferol derivatives, thus presenting a monohydroxy phenolic B ring. The aglycone quercetin (5) was used as positive control (Kato et al., 2003) and presented higher activity than its glucosides isoquercitrin (6) and rutin (7), suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-3 for enhancement of the MPO inhibitory activity. This trend has also been observed for kaempferol derivatives 1–4, as the glucosides pterogynoside (1), afzelin (3) and kaempferi- trin (4) exhibited IC50 values of 10.3, 13.9 and 15.8 nM, respectively, and were less active than the aglycone kaempferol (2, IC50 8.3 nM). These results indicate a clear positive correlation between MPO inhibitory activity and antioxidant properties of ﬂavonoids as shown in Table 2. The catechol on B ring and the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moieties have been extensively pointed out as the main fea- tures in ﬂavonoids associated with enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant activity (Van Acker et al., 1996). The presence of a galloyl group, e.g. in ﬂavonoids, has also been associ- ated with increased antioxidant capacity (Heijnen et al., 2002). In this respect, the presence of an additional galloyl unit in compound 1 might explain its higher MPO inhibi- tory activity, when compared with compounds 3 and 4. The antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging eﬀects using two diﬀerent assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay. Quercetin derivatives 5–7 showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with values of IC50 (lg/mL) of 4.12, 4.37 and 4.85, and DPPH with values of 2.60, 2.77 and 3.15, respectively, than kaempferol derivatives 1–4 (Table 2), indicating a major role of the catechol moiety on the B-ring Table 2 Myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory activity and free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) towards ABTS and DPPH of ﬂavonols 1-7 Compound MPO inhibition IC50 (nM)a Free radical scavenging activity ABTS IC50 (lg/mL)a DPPH IC50 (lg/mL)a Pterogynoside (1) 10.3 ± 0.03 8.10 ± 0.1 >80.0 Kaempferol (2) 8.30 ± 0.03 18.0 ± 0.5 17.8 ± 0.8 Afzelin (3) 13.9 ± 0.04 17.0 ± 0.7 >80.0 Kaempferitrin (4) 15.8 ± 0.05 18.5 ± 0.2 55.8 ± 0.8 Quercetin (5)b 1.22 ± 0.01 4.12 ± 0.2 2.60 ± 0.1 Isoquercitrin (6) 3.75 ± 0.02 4.37 ± 0.2 2.77 ± 0.4 Rutin (7) 3.60 ± 0.02 4.85 ± 0.2 3.15 ± 0.3 Trolox� – 0.63 ± 0.3 4.72 ± 0.4 a IC50 values were determined by regression linear and expressed as means ± SD of tree replicates. b Quercetin was used as positive control (Kato et al., 2003).

Additionally, among compounds 1–4, increas- ing activities were observed for pterogynoside (1) and kaempferol (2), which conﬁrms the importance of the free hydroxyl groups on C-3 (in 2) and the enhancement of RSA due to the galloyl group (in 1) in both assays. Among compounds 5–7, quercetin (5) exhibited higher activity than its 3-O-glucosyl derivatives 6 and 7, which conﬁrmed the inﬂuence of the free-hydroxy group at C-3 for potenti- ating the free radical scavenging activity of ﬂavonoids. 3. Concluding remarks In summary, ﬂavonoids with either the catechol moiety or a,b-unsaturated carbonyl with the free hydroxyl group at C-3 have shown best anti-radicalar and MPO inhibitory properties, which corroborates the involvement of MPO in redox processes. The absence of such features in ptero- gynoside (1) has been counteracted by the galloyl moiety on C-300 leading to MPO inhibitory activity comparable to kaempferol (2), and higher free radical scavenging abil- ity than 2 or its glucosides 3 and 4. Flavonols from P. nitens presented potent inhibition towards the pro-oxidant and pro-inﬂammatory enzyme myeloperoxidase and potent radical scavenging eﬀects, which may be particularly important because they are eas- ily available in the plant kingdom (Middleton et al., 2000) and are able to protect biological systems against stress phenomena such as lipid peroxidation, as shown for a vari- ety of kaempferol derivatives exhibiting high antioxidant selectivity (Gebre-Mariam et al., 2005), and for quercetin and its derivatives, which have been shown to protect cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and calcium dysreg- ulation (Wang and Joseph, 1999). 4. Experimental 4.1. General methods Melting points were recorded on a Microquimica MQAPF-301 melting point apparatus. The 1D – (1H, 13C and DEPT) and 2D – (1H – 1H gCOSY, gHMQC and gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 126 MHz (13C), using the solvents as an internal standard. Negative-ion high resolution mass spectra were recorded on HRMS ultrOTOFQ-ESI-TOF instrument (Bruker Dal- tonics). IR spectra absorptions were measured on a Perkin Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr discs, whereas UV spectra were acquired on a Perkin Elmer UV–vis Lambda 14P spectrophotometer. Optical rotations were measured on a Polamat A Carl Zeiss Jena polarimeter. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 using a Phenomenex C-18 column (250 mm � 4.6 mm). Column chromatography (CC) was performed over reversed-phase silica gel 230–400 mesh (Merck). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and pre- coated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisalde- hyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 �C. Pre- parative HPLC was carried out using a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm � 21.2 mm) preparative column. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden.

Plant material Fruits of P. nitens were collected in the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003. A vou- cher specimen (SP204319) has been deposited in the her- barium of the Botanic Institute (Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil). 4.3. Extraction and isolation The shade-dried fruits (2 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with n-hexane (15 L � 5, at room tempera- ture, for two weeks) and exhaustively extracted by macer- ation with EtOH (25 L � 5) at room temperature. The combined ethanol extracts were concentrated in vacuo (< 40 �C) to yield 8.0 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with CH3OH:H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 2.5 and 3.8 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue was subjected to silica gel (230–400 mesh) CC eluted with EtOAc/MeOH gradient (0–100% MeOH) to aﬀord eight fractions (E1–E8) and free agly- cones 2 (220.9 mg) and 5 (150.8 mg). Fraction E6 (397.8 mg) was further puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeOH:- H2O:AcOH (58:42:0.1), UV detection at 254 nm; ﬂow rate 10 mL/min], aﬀording acylated ﬂavonol 1 (115.9 mg) and two ﬂavonol monoglycosides 3 (82.9 mg) and 6 (78.7 mg). The n-BuoH residue was dissolved into MeOH and sub- mitted to gel ﬁltration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, aﬀording 23 fractions (B1–B23). After TLC com- parison, fractions B12–B19 were combined (488.3 mg) and puriﬁed by RP-HPLC using MeOH:H2O:AcOH (68:32:0.1) as mobile phase, with UV detection at 254 nm and ﬂow rate of 12 mL/min, aﬀording ﬂavonol diglycosides 4 (150.7 mg) and 7 (299.0 mg). 4.4.

Assay for MPO inhibitory activity MPO inhibitory eﬀects of ﬂavonols 1–7 were evaluated through guaiacol oxidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 nM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mM). The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calcu- lated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiacol (70 mM) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at diﬀerent sample concentrations of compounds 1–7 (0.50–50 nM) and in the their absence (Kato et al., 2003). The IC50 values were calculated from the rates calculated on the basis of inhibition percentage expressed in concentration–response curves. 4.6. Evaluation of radical scavenging activity (RSA) Radical scavenging activity (RSA) of compounds 1–7 was determined using DPPH� (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS�+ [2,20-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sul- fonic acid)] as reagents. Sample solutions of 1–7 and Trolox� at various concentrations (10–100 lg/ml) in EtOH were indi- vidually added to 0.6 mM DPPH in EtOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 �C for 30 min (Soares et al., 1997; Duarte-Almeida et al., 2006). Remaining DPPH was deter- mined colorimetrically at 531 nm by blanking against abso- lute ethanol. ABTS�+ was prepared by reacting 5 mL of ABTS (7 mM) water soln. with 88 lL of 140 mM potassium persulphate (ratio 1:0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12–16 h before use. Prior to assay ABTS�+ stock soln. was diluted with KH2PO4/ K2HPO4 (100 mM, pH 7.0 diluted 1:10 before use) buﬀer soln. (ratio 1:88). One milliliter ABTS�+ was added to glass test tubes containing diﬀerent concentrations of compound 1 and Trolox� (0.5–7.0 lg/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical scavenging activity (Pellegrini et al., 1999). Anti-radical abilities against ABTS�+ and DPPH� species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (inhibition%) calculated from the equation: Inhibi- tion % = [1 � (Asample/A) � 100], where A is test absorbance without sample (only solvent and free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with compounds 1–7 or Trolox�.
