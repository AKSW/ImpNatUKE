All rights reserved  INTRODUCTION  Neoraputia magn$ca  (Engler)  Emmerich  is a tree  found only in northwestern  Brazil [ 11. It was originally  described  by Engler as a species of Raputia Aublet.  Emmerich  later proposed  the new genus Neoraputia  Emmerich  to accommodate  six species, four of them  form Raputia and two new ones. These two genera  are assigned  to the tribe Cusparieae  [I]. No previous  phytochemical  work has been reported  on Raputia.  Recently,  we have described  the isolation  and identi-  fication  of eight polymethoxylated  flavones  and one  flavanone  from N. alba [2, 31. Little is known  about  the chemistry  of the Neoraputia, but, to date, it differs  from other taxa of the tribe Cusparieae,  notably  by  the absence of anthranilate  alkaloids,  coumarins  and  limonoids  [4]. The extensive  0-methylation  of highly  oxygenated  flavones  is a feature  that is largely con-  fined  to the Citroideae  [5]. Thus,  our taxonomic  interest in the Rutaceae  stimulated  an investigation  of  another  plant of the Neoraputia genus, e.g. N. mag-  n$ca var. magn$ca (Engler) Emmerich.  RESULTS AND  DlSCCSSlON  The hexane extract from the stems of N. magnifica  var. magniJica, afforded  two new flavonoids  1 and 3,  besides three known flavonoids  2’-hydroxy-3,4,4’,5,6’-  * Based in part on the Ph.D. thesis presented by E.A.P.P.  to the Universidade Federal de S&o Carlos.  t Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.  pentamethoxychalcone  (2)  [6],  5,7,3’,4’,5’-penta-  methoxyflavanone  (4)  [2] and  5,6,7,3’,4’,5’-hexa-  methoxyflavone  (5) [7], and a mixture of sitosterol  and  stigmasterol.  Compound  1 was isolated  in very small amounts  (0.7 mg) as a yellow  powder.  The UV absorption  maximum  at 286 and 352 nm suggested  the presence  of a chalcone  [6]. The IR bands at 1620 and 3348 cm-’  were attributed  to chelated  carbonyl  and phenolic  hydroxyl  group, respectively.  Two doublets  at 6 8.05  and 7.72 (J = 16.0 Hz) in the ‘H NMR  spectrum  (Table 1) revealed the AB system of a chalcone  and a  singlet  at S 14.24 corresponded  to one  chelated  hydroxyl,  thus attached  to C-2’. The ‘H NMR  spec-  trum also showed features of a chromene  ring (6 6.60  and 5.47 vinylic protons,  and a singlet at 6 1.50, 6H,  assigned  to a pair of magnetically  equivalent  methyl  group),  and signals for four methoxyls.  The assign-  ment of one singlet to H-2 and H-6 (6 6.86, 2H) sug-  gested that three methoxyls  are attached  to B-ring.  From  the biosynthetic  point  of view the remaining  methoxyl  should be attached  to C-4’ or C-6’ of the A-  ring. Furthermore,  a singlet  at 6 6.07 (1H) clearly  indicated  the A-ring to be 2’.4’5’6’- or 2’,3’,4’,6’-tetra-  substituted.  From the HMBC  experiments  (Table 2)  the observed  correlations  between  the hydroxyl  pro-  ton at 6 14.24 and the “C signals at 6 105.9 (J’), 167.9  (J*) and 92.5 ($) led to their assignment  as C-l’, C-2’  and C-3’, respectively,  and thus indicating  that the  unsubstituted  carbon must be vicinal to C-2’. The “C  NMR  spectrum  (Table 3) showed  a signal for only  one methoxyl  group  attached  to ortho-disubstituted  carbon  (6 63.1) which was assigned  to 4-OMe.  This  1533  E. PASSAD~R  et al.

This was sup-  ported  by the ‘H NMR  spectrum  run in C6D, which  showed  upfield shift (As > 0.3) for three methoxyls  [8]. Moreover,  the existence ofcorrelation  between the  ‘H signal at 6 6.07, assigned to H-3’ (by HMQC  and  HMBC),  and the ‘% signal at 6 102.9 (C-5’), con-  firmed the position  of the chromene  ring between the  C-5’ and O-6’. The new natural  product  is therefore  2’-hydroxy-3,4,4’,5-tetramethoxy-5’,6’-(2”,2”-  dimethyl-pyran)chalcone  (1). The structural  assign-  ment was also supported  by comparison  of the 13C  NMR  spectrum  with those  of 2’-hydroxy-3,4,4’,6’-  tetramethoxychalcone  (6) and 2’-hydroxy-3’,4’,5’,6’-  di-(2”,2’‘-dimethylpyran)chalcone  (7, flemiculosin)  [9].  It has been noted that the H-/l and C-p of a chalcone  are more  deshielded  than  the  H-o! and  C-a  [9].  However,  HMQC  experiments  of  1 showed  cor-  relations  of ‘H signals at 6 8.05 and 7.72 to the 13C  signals at 6 126.5 and 142.3, respectively,  indicating  apparent  anomalies.  The signal (6 6.86) assigned  to  H-2 and H-6 showed  one-bond  correlation  with the  13C signals at 6 105.3. The methine  proton  at 6 7.72  showed cross peaks with the C-Z/C-6 signal at 6 105.3  (3J), so permitting  the assignment  of the signal at 6  7.72 to H-b.  Compound  2 gave spectral data in agreement  with  those published  [6] for the 2’-hydroxy-3,4,4’,5,6’-pen-  tamethoxychalcone  which  has previously  been iso-  lated from MerriNia  caloxylon (Citroideae).  However,  the “C NMR data for 2 are reported  here for the first  time (Table 3). Compound  1 and 6 were used as a  model.  HMQC  and HMBC  (Table  2) experiments  with 2 permitted  the assignment  of the signal at 6  7.71 to H-j?, as in 1, and suggested  that the highly  1536  E. PAS~ADOR et al  oxygenated B-ring may have caused a upfield shift for  (SPF 81-3 16) is deposited in the Herbarium of Insti-  H-8.  tuto de Ciencias Biologicas-USP-Sao  Paula.  Compound  3 was isolated  with  a trace  of  5,7,3’,4’,5’-pentamethoxyflavanone  (4)  previously  isolated from N. a&a [3]. The mixture was analysed  by GC-mass spectrometry, which established that the  flavanones were 4 and 3. The presence of fragment  ion at m/z 194 (100%) in the mass spectrum for 3,  associated with retro-Diels-Alder  cleavage of C-ring,  clearly indicated the presence of three methoxyls in  the B-ring. Thus, a singlet at 6 6.68 in the ‘H NMR  spectrum (Table 1) was assigned to H-2’ and H-6’,  requiring the presence of methoxyls at C-3’, C-4’ and  C-5’. The fragment ion at m/z 211, also associated  with retro-Diels-Alder  cleavage of C-ring, suggested  that the A-ring carried three methoxyls. Therefore,  three isomers are possible for this compound.  The  correct one was decided on the basis of ‘% NMR  spectrum (Table 3) which showed signals for three  methoxyl groups attached to ortho-disubstituted  car-  bon (6 60.9, 61.4 and 61.7). This implies that the  methoxyls in the A-ring is located at C-5, C-6 and C-  7, since the ‘H signal at 6 6.38 (1H) for unsubstituted  methine indicate that this proton must not be vicinal  to C==G (C-4). A comparison of 13C chemical shifts  of 5,7,8trimethoxyflavanone  (6 89.5, C-6) 5,7,8- (6  93.7, C-6) and 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavones  (6 96.7, C-S)  indicated that C-8 methine resonance at lowerfield  than C-6 methine [9]. Based on this evidence, the 13C  signal at 6 96.4 for C-8 supported the above proposed.  The structure of the new natural product is therefore  5,6,7,3’,4’,5’-hexamethoxyflavanone  (3).  Isolation of compounds. Ground stems (850 g) was  extracted with hexane, then CH$l,  and finally with  MeOH. The cont. hexane extract was submitted to  vacuum chromatography  over silica gel using a hex-  ane-CH,Cl,MeOH  gradient to give a mixt. of fatty  acids followed by 3 frs. Fr. containing  1 and a mixt.  of sterols was then flash rechromatographed  as above  and then by prep. TLC (silica gel, CH,Cl,-MeOH,  99: 1) to yield 0.7 mg of pure 1 and a mixt. of sterols  (2 mg). This mixt. was analysed by GC-MS, which  established that the sterols were sitosterol and stig-  masterol. Fr. 2 was purified by prep. TLC as above to  give 2 (9 mg). Fr. 3 was subjected to reverse-phase  chromatography  on silanized silica gel with a gradient  mixt. of H,O-MeOH  providing 10 frs. Fr. 4 was flash  rechromatographed  over silica gel using a hexane-  EtOAc gradient, to give the following compounds: 3  (1.2 mg; with trace of 4) 4 (1 mg) and 5 (1.5 mg).  2’-Hydroxy-3,4,4’,5-tetramethox,v-5’,6’-(2”,2”-di-  methylpyrun)  chalcone  (1).

These results do not seem to support the affiliation  of Neoruputiu to the Cusparieae [4]. However, many  chemists are perhaps interested  in alkaloids,  cou-  marins and limonoids from Rutaceae, and will rarely  identify all of the potentially  systematic important  classes of compounds  present in the plant, e.g. fla-  vonoids, since they are generally found in most if not  all angiosperm  plants. Thus, clearly rutaceous fla-  vonoids  deserve more attention  than  they have  received so far.
