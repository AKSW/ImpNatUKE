Accepted 1 December 1972)  Key Word Index-Lorostemon  coelhoi; Lorostemon negrensis; Guttiferae; 6,7-dihydroxy-l-methoxypyrano-  (2’,3’: 3,4)xanthone;  lorostemin.  The trunk wood of two Amazonian Guttiferae species, Lorostemon coelhoi Paula and  L. negrensis Froes,2 yielded yellow crystals of a new compound, lorostemin. Preliminary  scrutiny of MS and PMR spectra of the compound disclosed the formula C,3H,02(OH)z-  OMe(CH=CHCMe,O)  which is compatible with a xanthone structure. Two of the un-  defined protons must be para related and both ortho to hydroxyls. Their PMR singlets  appear at a substantially lower field in the spectrum of the diacetate than in the spectrum  of the dimethyl ether (An-a 040 ppm, An-5 O-48 ppm). The third singlet of the aromatic  PMR region, which is not shifted upon acetylation, occurs at relatively high field (T 3.43),  and corresponds thus to a proton at C-2 or C-4 of a 1,3-dioxygenated ring.3 Only the former  alternative  can be correct, since treatment  of di-0-methyllorostemin  with cold cont.  H,SO, leads to a 1-hydroxyxanthone  (AlCl,-shift of UV maxima) which gives a negative  Gibbs test.4 The angular pyrano-structure  I which thus emerges for lorostemin is consistent  with the wavelength of the principal UV maximum (275 nm). Linear pyranoxanthones  show  the corresponding band at 295 nm.5  0  OMe  Even diffuse daylight transforms lorostemin gradually into a sparingly soluble derivative.  Both compounds are soluble in aqueous borax and show similar mass spectral fragmentation  patterns. The PMR spectra of the acetates are identical with respect to the aromatic regions.  The signals due to the side chain protons, however, are strikingly different, revealing the  replacement of the olefinic protons of lorostemin by protons at saturated carbons in the  derivative. Light induced double bond addition must thus be held responsible for its  formation.  * Part XXXII in the series “The Chemistry of Brazilian Guttiferae”.

The  concentrated  benzene solution gave a crystalline mass (80 g) which was separated by filtration from an oil  (5 g). The crystals plus some ahering oil were recrystallized repeatedly from hot acetone, yielding in the first  crops the photodimer.  The mother liquors were evaporated.  The residue was freed from oil by washings  with light petrol. and recrystallized from hot MeOH giving lorostemin (I). The presence of lorostemin in the  wood of Lorostemon  negrensis was demonstrated  by preparative TLC.  Lorostemin  (I). Yellow crystals, m.p. 258-259” (Me#ZO) (Found:  C, 67.15; H, 4.80.
