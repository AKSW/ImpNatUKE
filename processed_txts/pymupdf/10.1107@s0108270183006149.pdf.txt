741  Acta Cryst. (1983). C39, 741-742  7-Hydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanquinone (Claussequinone), C16H1405  BY M. T. P. GAMBARDELLA, Y. P. MASCARENHAS AND R. H. A. SANTOS  Universidade de $5o Paulo, Instituto de F[sica e Qu[mica de $5o Carlos, CP 369, 13560 S~o Carlos SP, Brazil  (Received 1 September 1982; accepted 24 January 1983)  Abstract. M r = 286.2, tetragonal, P41, a = 6.740 (1),  c=29.411 (2)A, V= 1336(4)/~ 3, Z=4, Din= 1.41  (flotation), D x = 1.42 Mg m -a, 2(Cu Ks)= 1.54018 A,,  g(CuKs) = 0.54 mm -1,  F(000) = 600,  room  tem-  perature, final R = 0.064 for 1237 observations. The  quinone ring is linked in an equatorial position to the  chroman ring. The extended structure shows a helical  arrangement of the molecules along the c axis.  Introduction. The title compound is one of the  components of the extract from the heartwood of  Cyclobium claussene Benth., a tree originating from the  region of Pedro Leopoldo, State of Minas Gerais,  Brazil. The main component of its benzenic extract is  an orange pigment that was named claussequinone in  view of its quinonic character. The proton NMR and  mass spectroscopy analysis of this compound disclosed  its  isoflavanquinonic  skeleton  and  pattern  of  substituents. ORD studies of this compound and of a  synthetic compound allowed the determination of the  configuration shown in Fig. 1 (Gottlieb, Oliveira,  Gonqalves, Oliveira & Pereira, 1975). This X-ray  diffraction study was carried out to elucidate the precise  molecular conformation of the heterocyclic ring, and to  look for any hydrogen bond present in the crystalline  structure.  Experimental. Red-orange single crystals, tetragonal-  pyramidal habit, obtained by slow evaporation of  ethanol-chloroform solution, single-crystal dimension  about 0.4 mm. Cell dimensions from setting angles of  25 high-angle reflections, CAD-4 automatic diffrac-  tometer, room temperature, 0 < 70 °, 0--20 scan mode,  graphite-monochromatized Cu Ka radiation, Lp correc-  tions, absorption and extinction corrections ignored.  1537 measured  unique reflexions,  1237 observed  [F2> 2tr(F2)]; structure solved by direct methods  (Germain, Main & Woolfson, 1971) and refined by  ,x Id  O  0¢~0Me  Fig. 1. Molecular structure as disclosed by proton NMR and  ORD.  0108-2701/83/060741-02501.50  full-matrix least-squares calculations by minimization  of  ~w(klFol--IFcl) 2,  where  w= [a(Fo) 2 +  (0.05Fo)2] -1 for observed and w = 0 for unobserved  reflexions, until all the atomic-parameter shifts were  smaller than their standard deviations. The final  unweighted R factor, omitting unobserved reflexions,  was 0.064 (including them 0.067).* Anisotropic tem-  perature factors were assigned to all non-hydrogen  atoms. Neutral complex scattering factors were used  (International Tables for X-ray Crystallography,  1974). Final positional parameters for the H atoms  were calculated assuming a C-H bond length of 1.0 A  and the expected geometry, with isotropic temperature  factors assumed to be 6.0 A 2.  Discussion. Table 1 gives the atomic parameters for the  C and O atoms. The atomic notation, and interatomic  distances and bond angles are shown in Fig. 2. There  are no unusual bond lengths in the structure. The bond  distances and angles in the chroman ring agree well  with  those  found  in  two  adducts  of  4-(p-  hydroxyphenyl)-2,2,4-trimethylchroman with ethanol  and chloroform (Flippen, Karle & Karle, 1970). The  benzene and the quinone rings are planar [average  distances of atoms from the planes are 0.011 (4) and  0.019 (8)A respectively[ and the dihedral angle be-  tween the best least-squares plane through these rings is  26.9 °. A distorted half-chair conformation of the  dihydropyran ring can be observed from the deviations  of the atoms 0(4), C(2), C(3) and C(4) from the best  least-squares plane through the benzene ring [0.027 (3),  0.439 (4), --0.350 (3) and 0.052 (4) A respectively[  and  from  the  torsion  angle  of  the  bond  O(4)-C(2)-C(3)-C(4), 66.1 °. The quinone ring is  linked to the chroman ring by C(3) in an equatorial  position. Table 2 shows some torsion angles to  characterize the conformation of the molecule.  The packing of the molecules, shown in Fig. 3, is  stabilized by a system of hydrogen bonds which  generates a helical arrangement along the c axis.
