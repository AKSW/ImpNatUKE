Yakovlev root bark led to the isolation of the quinolizidine alkaloids lupanine, acosmine, acosmi- nine and lupanacosmine, as well as the diaza-adamantane alkaloids panacosmine and dasycarpumine. Lupanacosmine (4) and dasycarpumine (6) have been described for the ﬁrst time herein. � 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Acosmium dasycarpum (Vog.)Yakovlev,1–3 occurs predominantly at the Brazilian savannahs (the ‘Cerrados’),3,4 being locally known as perobinha, chapada, pau paratudo, or unha d’anta.4–6 The tea prepared from the root bark of this species has been described in the ﬁrst edition of the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia as a sedative. In folk medicine, the stem and root tea preparation have been used to treat inﬂammation, skin diseases, and disturbances from central nervous and cardio-vascular systems.7–10 Quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs) are secondary compounds found in seeds of many species of plants, possibly protecting them against pathogens and seed predators. Structural, spectroscopic and computational studies on both natural and synthetic quinolizidines are also reported regu- larly and have shown to be an important class of alkaloid with biological signiﬁcance.11 Studies on the biological activity of compounds containing azabicyclic building blocks (e.g., rigid bicy- clic peptidomimetics) are gaining momentum because this class is attractive as nematicidal and has shown to be especially active at the muscarinic receptor, enhancing insulin secretion and also pre- senting diuretic properties.12 On the other hand, diaza-adaman- tane skeleton was ﬁrstly encountered in a natural product, isolated from the seeds of Acosmium panamense.1 This class of compounds is uncommon, but due to the high pharmacological activities it has recently drawn great attention in folk medicine research.13 Aiming the isolation and identiﬁcation of bioactive substances, we have isolated several alkaloids during the conventional chro- matographic fractioning of the methanol crude extract from the root bark of A. dasycarpum. The alkaloids lupanine 1, acosmine 2, acosminine 3, and panacosmine 5 have been previously reported in Acosmium.1,14 However, the alkaloids lupanacosmine 4 and dasycarpumine 6 have been described for the ﬁrst time herein. Acosmium dasycarpum aerial roots were collected at Chapada dos Guimarães, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil and identiﬁed by Dr. M. Macedo (Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso—UFMT). Voucher specimens numbered 24079 (01/02/2000) were deposited at UFMT Central Herbarium. The dried root barks (3.3 kg) were sequentially extracted with hexane (3 L) and methanol (5 L). A portion (55.0 g) of the crude methanol extract (EBMeOH) dissolved in methanol (200 mL) was acidiﬁed with 10% acetic acid (pH 2.5–3.0), extracted with CHCl3 (3 � 50 mL) and alkalinized with NH4OH (pH 8.9–9.0), affording the alkaloids fraction FA-I (5.5 g; 9.98%). FA-I was sub- mitted to column chromatography, affording compound 6 (11.5 mg; 0.02%). Compound 1 (3.3 mg; 0.006%) was obtained after HPLC puriﬁcation.15 Another EBMeOH portion (150.0 g) was acidi- ﬁed with 5% HCl (pH 2.5–3.0), extracted with ethyl ether (4 � 50 mL) and alkalinized with 28% NH4OH (pH 8.5–9.0), afford- ing the alkaloids fraction FA-II (3.8 g; 2.53%). Preparative thin-layer chromatography carried out on FA-II led to the isolation of 2 (15.3 mg; 0.01%),1 3 (21.2 mg; 0.14%),1 4 (56.4 mg; 0.04%),16 and 5 (8.1 mg; 0.01%).1,17 Compound 1 has shown, in its IR spectrum, typical amide absorption at 1620 cm�1. This absorption is coherent with the 13C NMR signal at d 172.0.

Tetrahedron Letters 49 (2008) 6289–6292 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Tetrahedron Letters journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/tetlet data obtained for compound 1 were fully consistent with the liter- ature description for the quinolizidine alkaloid lupanine.12,14,18 Mass spectra for compound 2 has shown an odd molecular ion [M+] at 357, pointing out to the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in its structure. The DEPT experiment has pre- sented a methinic signal at d 70.9. Therefore in comparison with compound 1, compound 2 must have a substituent at C-10. The absence of an amide carbonyl group at C-2, as well as the evidences for the presence of the substituent at C-10, could be demonstrated from the HMBC data, correlating H-10 (d 2.36) to C-2 (d 52.9) C-8 (d 27.9), C-9 (d 37.3), C-11 (d 60.8), C-18 (d 117.4), C-19 (d 24.7), and C-23 (d 123.0) (Fig. 1A; Table 2). In the same experiment, the correlation of H-23 (d 6.67/7.27) to C-10 (d 70.9), C-19 (d 24.7) and C-21 (d 40.4) (Fig. 1B; Table 2) and the correlation of H-25 (d 2.20/2.15) to C-23 (d 123.0/122.0) and C-24 (d 168.0) (Table 2) has also been observed. The coupling of H-23 (d 6.67/ 2.15) to C-23 (d 123.0/122.0) has been shown by the COSY and HSQC exper- iments. HMBC experiments has shown that the methylic H-25 (d 2.20/7.27) correlates to C-24 (d 168.0) and C-23 (d 123.0/122.0), conﬁrming the presence of an acetylamide portion at the substitu- ent (Fig. 1B). Restricted rotation around C–N bond at the acetyla- mide moiety has caused the doubling of 13C NMR signals at C-23 and C-25 (Table 2). The same has been observed in 1H NMR spectra, at positions H-23 and H-25, as previously observed in the litera- ture.1,14 The stereochemistry of the substituent at C-10 in com- pound 2 has been demonstrated to be equatorial, as it could be seen by the coupling of H-8ax with H-10ax in the COSY experiment (Table 2). These data are fully supportive of structure 2, previously reported by the literature.14 However, literature 13C NMR spectral data have shown the following attribution to C-6 (d 57.9), C-7 (d 37.1), C-9 (d 44.8), C-11 (d 67.6), C-19 (d 33.3), and C-20 (d 25.7).14 These data are not consistent with the ones we have 2 N N N CH3 O 19 8 10 23 18 9 11 H 19 21 N N N CH3 O 10 H A  B  Figure 1.

Trevisan et al. / Tetrahedron Letters 49 (2008) 6289–6292 observed, namely at C-6 (d 67.5), C-7 (d 33.0), C-9 (d 37.3), C-11 (d 60.8), C-19 (d 24.7), and C-20 (d 21.6). Our attribution can be con- sidered more reliable, however, since it was based in 2-D experi- ments, not available at the time of the previous literature report. The spectral data for compound 3 were similar to those observed for 2, except for ring D. Mass spectrum for compound 3 has shown a molecular ion at m/z 373, sixteen units higher than compound 2, suggesting the presence of a hydroxyl group. Further evidence for the presence of this group was observed by the IR absorption at 3393 cm�1, by DEPT experiment showing a carbinolic signal at d 68.6 and by the shifting of C-12 and C-14 13C NMR signal from d 34.3 to d 42.9 and from d 25.7 to d 34.2, respectively (Table 1). The c-gauche effect observed by analyzing C-11 and C-15 13C NMR signals of compound 3, when compared to the equivalent sig- nals in 2 (Table 1), has shown that the hydroxyl group is in an axial position. These data were consistent with the literature structure for the alkaloid acosminine.14 Typically, quinolizidine alkaloids 1H NMR spectra show poorly resolved signals at the region d 3.75–1.25. The presence of two methyl groups, attached to electro- negative atoms, at d 2.24 and d 2.18, however, could be observed in 1H NMR spectra from 4, differing from compound 3 by presenting an extra methyl group. Oleﬁnic hydrogens were evidenced by the multiplet centered at d 5.57 and the double duplet at d 5.02 at 1H NMR spectra.1 The respective oleﬁnic carbons could be ob- served in 13C NMR spectra at d 136.1 and d 116.3, relating to tri- substituted (@CH–) and bi-substituted (@CH2) carbons, respec- tively, according to the DEPT spectra. The analysis of the HMBC spectra analysis has shown that the methyl hydrogen H-15 (d 2.24) correlated to C-11 (d 59.3) and C-17 (d 50.9), showing that this methyl group is bonded to the nitrogen atom at ring C in com- pound 4. H-12 (d 2.16) methylenic hydrogen correlating to C-9 (d 34.3) and C-11 (d 59.3) as well as the allylic group C-13 (d 136.1) and C-14 (d 116.3) (Table 3) has also been observed. COSY spectrum has shown H-6 and H-2x coupling with each other, as well as the coupling of H-2x with H-2y and H-6, suggesting a chair conforma- tion to ring A in compound 4 (Fig. 2). The non-observation of H-10 coupling to H-8 indicates that the acetylamide group is in an equa- torial position. This equatorial stereochemistry was further conﬁrmed by the correlation of H-9 with axial H-10 and H-9 with H-8x and H-8y, with small J values, justifying the observed H-9 large singlet. The diaza-adamantane alkaloid 5, namely panacos- mine, has been previously described in the literature1 and the spectral data (13C and 1H NMR, IR and high resolution MS) are fully consistent with the ones we have obtained.17 The newly described compound 6 spectral data19 were compared with the related 6 10 9 12 2 24 15 23 17 11 8 20 4 N N CH3 O N CH3 CH2 Figure 2.
