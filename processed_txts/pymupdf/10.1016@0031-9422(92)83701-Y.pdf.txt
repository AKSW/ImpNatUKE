Abstract-The  aqueous alcohol extract of the leaves of Alibertia macrophylla afforded two epimeric pairs of iridoid  aglycones and one of them showed high inhibitory activity against Aspergillus niger, Ciadosporium sphaerospermum, C.  cladosporioides and Colletotrichum gloesporioides. Three of the compounds  are reported for the !irst time from natural  sources. Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic studies, mainly through 13C NMR analysis.  WTRODUci’ION  Several tropical Brazilian Rubiaceae species from the rain  forest and ‘cerrado’, produce phytoalexins in response to  fungal inoculation  [l J. It has been shown that the  response is dependent on the seasonal conditions. Among  15 assayed species, Alibertia macrophylla K. Schum. and  A. myrcijolia Spruce  ex. Schum.  have shown negative  phytoalexin response all year round. On the other hand,  the species of Alibertia contain the highest quantities of  diffusable phenols, although no fungitoxic activity had  been detected [23. Furthermore,  extracts obtained from  leaves of A. macrophyzla have revealed, after TLC bio-  assays, three different fungitoxic zones [Z]. Phytochemi-  cal studies evidenced that two caiTeic acid esters, one of  them with antifungal activity, should correspond to one  of the inhibitory zones [3]. In addition, another fraction  that showed strong inhibitory  activity against fungal  growth was analysed. The isolation and structural elu-  cidation of the compounds  of this fraction revealed the  presence of the epimeric mixtures of non-glycosidic  iri-  doids la-ld.  The aglycones lb, le and ld are being  reported for the first time from natural sources. In this  paper we present the structure elucidation of these com-  pounds and the bioassay results with one of the iridoid  epimeric pairs.  RESULTS AND DISCUSMON  The 40% aqueous alcohol extract prepared from dried  and powdered leaves of A. macrophylla was submitted to  partition into hexane and ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate-  soluble fraction was examined by TLC and three fungi-  toxic zones (R, 0.22,0.36 and 0.65) were detected, using a  spore suspension of Clados~rium  sphaeros~r~m  [4].  This extract was fractioned on a silica gel column and by  IAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed.

The ‘HNMR (Table 1) and  13CNMR (Table 2) spectral data for la and lb revealed  an iridoidal skeleton with a carbomethoxy substituent at  C-4 and a methyl group at C-8. These data resemble those  which were reported for the aglycone loganetin [S, 63.  The close similarity of their UV absorption maxima and  their molecular ions at m/z 228, pointed to loganetin as  one of the isomers. This assumption  was confirmed by  ‘jCNMR  chemical shifts and multiplicities  (DEPT).  Taking the “CNMR  6 values assigned to loganetin as  reference data [S, 63, it could be deduced that the epimeric  mixture was at C-l.  The W  absorption  maxima and molecular ions ob-  tained for lc and Id were identical to those observed for  la and lb. The analysis of the ‘HNMR  (Table 1) and  ’ 3C NMR (Table 2) data evidenced that lc and Id are also  iridoidal aglycones whose skeleton must be the same as  that of la and lb. The main differences observed in the  13C NMR spectra correspond to the carbinolic carbons  at S78.8/78.5 and to the methyl groups at 6 16.9/15.1. To  elucidate the differences in the substitution  pattern of lc  and Id, ‘HNMR  correlated ~~ctros~py  COSY was  used to assign all resonance  signals in the ‘HNMR  spectra. The carbinolic  protons at 64.15 (3=9.0;  6.7;  2.8 Hz)/6420 (J =6.5; 2.5; 1.5 Hz) were consistent with H-  C-6. Besides, it was evidenced that the protons at C-l  3433  3434  M. C. M. YOUNG et al.

Comparison of the 13C NMR data of lc  and Id with those for dihydrocornin  [73 indicated this  iridoidal system for lc and Id; the observed differences  between them are due to the size and functionality of the  glucose moiety present in dihydrocornin.  Thus it was  possible to propose that one of the isomers corresponded  to the aglycone of dihydrocornin  and the other would be  its epimer at C-l. The acetylation (Ac,O/pyridine)  of la,  lb and lc, Id confirmed the position of epimerization.  The P-configuration assigned to the acetyl function at C-l  of le and If was deduced mainly through analysis of the  H-l chemical shift and J, 9 values recorded in the  ‘H NMR spectra of these derivatives. On the basis of the  Karplus rule for dihedral angles between H-l and H-9,  the pseudoequato~al  position of the substituent at C-l  was revealed since dihedral  angles of ca 118 ’ were  observed for lc (J1 ,., = 3.5 Hz) and If (5, 9 = 3.2 Hz). This  assumption is quite consistent with previously reported  considerations  of changes in the different hemi-chair  conformations of the flexible dihydropyran  ring of iridoi-  da1 systems [7J  The epimeric pair lc and ld, corresponding  to the R,  0.36 zone, showed antifungal activity against As~r~ilZus  niger,  C~adosp~r~~~  sp~aeros~er~u~,  C. ~l~ospor~oides  and Col~etotric~u~  ~loesporioides.  The acetyl derivatives  were similarly assayed with C. spherospermum  and also  displayed growth inhibitory activity. No previous report  was found concerning the occurrence of these iridoids as  natural aglycones and their presence and biological activ-  ity suggest that they can play a defensive role against  fungal attack.
