Abstract-The  trunk wood of Iryunthera  pofyneura  Ducke (Myristicaceae)  contains  pin~embrin,l-(~,~-dihydro-  xyphenyl)-3-(3”,4”-methylenedioxyphenyl)-propane,  l-(2’,4’-dihydroxy-3’-methylphenyl)-3-(~’-methoxy-~‘,S“-  methylenedioxyphenyl)-propane  and 4,~,~-trihydroxy-3-methoxydihydrochaicone.  INTRODUCTION  The nomadic  and very primitive  Maku Indians  of the  Apaporis  basin (Amazonia)  employ a plaster made of the  crushed  leaves of Iryanthera  polyneuru  Ducke (Myristi-  caceae) for treating  seriously  infected  wounds  and cuts  [3]. This ethnopharmacological  observation  stimulated  interest  in the chemistry  of the tree, and a study on the  composition  of its trunk  wood  was undertaken.  The  results are reported  in the present paper.  RESULTS  Fractionation  of a benzene  extract of the trunk wood  afforded,  besides  sitosterol  and pinocembrin,  the 1,3-  diarylpropane  la, previously  obtained  from I. coriacea  Ducke [S], two novel compounds,  the additional  diaryl-  propane  lc and the dihydrochalcone  2a, and a small  quantity ofa mixture containing  two chalcones tentatively  formulated  3a and 3b.  The basic  structure  of the diarylpropane,  C,,H  0-  Me(OH),OMe.O.,CH,,  was indicated  by ‘H and “C  NMR spectral  evidence  which pointed  to a CH,. CH, .  CH, chain flanked by two aryl groups.  One must bear  2-methoxy-4,5-methylened~oxy  substitutions.  The base  peak in the MS shows the correct  mass for a methoxy-  methylenedioxytropylium  ion; the ‘H NMR  spectrum  includes  two singlets  (6 3.34 and 3.42). The other  aryl  group  bears  2,4-dihydroxy-3-methyl  substitution.  The  ‘H NMR spectrum  includes two doublets (6 6.36 and 6.72,  J = 8 Hz); oxidation  of the compound  does not lead to  ortho or para-quinones;  a 13C NMR quartet at high field  (6 8.9)is compatible  only with a methyl between two vicinal  substituents  [S].

The basic structure  of the dihydrochalcone,  C,,H,,O-  (OH),OMe,  was indicated  by “H and 13C NMR spectral  evidence which pointed  to a CH, . CH, group flanked by  benzoyl  and aryl substituents.  The benzoyl  group must  be 2,4-dihydroxylated:  the molecule  has chelated  and  acidic hydroxyls  evidenced  by IR :lnd UV (AlCl,  and  NaOAc shifts) spectra;  acetylation  produces  NMR shifts  of the aromatic  C signals which are closely comparable  with the values observed  for 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone  (see Experimental).  The aryl group must bear 4-hydroxy-  3-methoxy  substitution:  the two oxy-functions  are located  at C-3 and C-4 (H-2, H-S and H-6 give a NMR multiplet  at 6 6.7-6.9);  acetylation  produces  paramagnetic  shifts  1016  M. E. I_ DE ALMEIDA et al.  ( f5.1  to +7.6 ppm) of the C-l, C-3 and C-5 signals, and a  small diamagnetic  shift (-2.1  ppm) of the C-4 signal,  leaving the C-2 and C-6 signals practically  unaffected. The  MS of this dihydrochalcone  (Za) is accordingly  very sim-  ple, since both the dihydroxybenzoyl  ion and the hydroxy-  methoxytro~ylium  ion have mje 137.  The constituents  of a mixture  obtained  in minute  amount  were tentatively  characterized  as chalcones  3a  and 3b by ‘H NMR spectroscopy.  Not only the molecular  peaks 286 (55%) and 300 (45%) of the MS, but also the  fragment  peaks  due  to dihydroxybe~zoyl  (m/e  137  (100 “/,)), hydroxy-methoxystyryl  (m/e 150 (80%))  and  dimethoxystyryl  (m/e  164 (50%)) ions, were consistent  with this hypothesis.  DISCUSSION  The biosynthesis  of cinnamylphenols  in Leguminosae  was postulated  to involve the cinnamylation  of triacetate  moieties  [7]. The fact that both the Leguminosae  and  the Myristicaceae  are isoflavonoid  accumulators  invites  the hypothesis  that, as a further  common  biochemical  feature,  cinnamylation  also occurs in both families, the  1,3-diarylpropanes  of Myristicaceae  being simply hydro-  genation  products  of intermediate  cinnamylphenols.  It  has,  nevertheless,  been  suggested  recently  that  the  co-occurrence  of  I,3-diaryipropanes  with  I,3-diaryl-  propan-2-01s  and flavans  points  to their  biosynthetic  derivation  from chalcones  [8), a postulate  which receives  now additionai  support  by the isolation  of a ~avanone  and, most importantly,  by the co-occurrence  of chalcone-  dihydrochaIcon~-1,3-diarylpropane  with identical  oxy-  genation  pattern  in Ir~J~ntizgra ~ol~neuru.  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation  of  the constituents.  Trunk wood of Iryanthera  polyneura  was collected near Manaus, Amazonas State, and  identified by the botanist Dr. William A. Rodrigues.
