Abstract--Seven  previously  characterized,  and two new compounds,  have been isolated from the stems and leaves of  Zanthoxylum petiolare, which was previously  misidentified  as Z. acutifolium. The two new compounds  have been  identified  on the basis of spectroscopic  evidence  as a protolimonoid  and a furofuran  lignan.  INTRODUflION  As a part of our continuing  investigation  into the chem-  ical composition  of Brazilian  Rutales,  we have recently  reported  the isolation  of a quinolone  alkaloid series from  Zanthoxylum petiolare St. Hil. [l]. Further  studies with  this plant have led to the isolation  of eight compounds,  including  a new protolimonoid  and a furofuran  lignan.  RESULTS AlVD DISCUSSION  Solvent extraction  of the leaves of Z. petiolare followed  by column  chromatography  of the lipid as described  previously  [l], led to the isolation  of five known  com-  pounds:  ( +)-sesamin  (3) [2, 33, (+)-piperitol  (4) [2,3],  (+)-piperitol-y,y-dimethylallylether  (5) [4], (E,E,Z)-N-  (2-methylpropyl)-2,4&tetradecatrienamide  (6)  [S, 63,  lionirosinol-3-l-O-/I-glucopyranoside  (7) [7-93, as well as  the new compounds  1 and 2. Similar isolation  procedures  carried  out with the stems of the same plant afforded  compounds  3, 6, 7, sitosterol,  (E,E)-N-(2-methylpropyl)-  2,4_tetradecadienamide  and lupeol [ 101.  Compound  1 exhibited  similar spectral characteristics  to skimmiarepin  A (8), previously  isolated  and identified  from Skimmia japonica Thumb.  var. intermedia Komatsu  [I 11, which allowed us to propose  that both compounds  had the same  pentacyclic  skeleton  and identical  side  chain at C-17. The IR spectrum  of 1 showed  a ketone  carbonyl  (1700 cm-‘),  which  was also confirmed  by  13CNMR  (6217.9) [12]. The ‘HNMR  spectrum  for 1  (Table 1) did not, however, have the signals for carbinolic  protons  as found in 8. The comparison  of all spectral data  for both 1 and 8 showed that the only difference between  them is in the ring A, where a carbonyl  is located at C-3 in  *Based in part on the Ph.D. Thesis presented by M.S.P.A. to  Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Slo Carlos.  fAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed.  1, as opposed  to an ester  in 8. The comparison  of  13CNMR  spectral  data (Table 2) obtained  for 1 with  those for 8 are in agreement  with the structure  proposed,  including  the presence  of an epimeric  mixture at C-21 as  also found for 8 (‘-‘CNMR:  698.1, 101.9) due to the two  possible  configurations,  z and j?, of the hydroxyl  group.  Additional  confirmation  of the structure  1 was ob-  tained  through  comparison  of its IR and ‘HNMR,  as  well as by TLC of its acetylated  derivative  (9) which co-  chromatographed  with an authentic  sample  of the 21-  acetyl-3-oxo-glabretal  (10). On the basis of these results  the compound  was identified  as 3-oxo-skimmiarepin.  The spectral  data observed  for 2 were very similar to  those  for the lignan  y,y-dimethylallylpiperitol  (5). The  presence  of the -CH,CH(OH)C(Me)=CH,  side chain  was deduced  from the ‘H NMR  (Table 3) signals.  The  signals, 64.96, 5.10 hrs, 1H each, were attributed  to the  exo-double  bond, that at 6 1.77 s, 3H, to the vinyl methyl  group and those at 64.09 dd, lH, to the carbinohc  proton.  The 13C NMR spectrum  (Table 4) confirmed  the presence  of the 5-carbon  side chain where two olefinic carbons  (6143.1, 109.7) were observed,  together  with 2 carbinolic  carbons  (673.4, 74.2), as well as a tertiary  methyl group  (6 18.9). The mass spectrum  displayed  the parent peak m/z  440 (lOO%), and the fragment  m/z 71 (C,H,O).  This  information  allowed  us to propose  the given structure  for this  compound,  which  is the oxidation  product  of 5, which has previously  been isolated  from this plant  species.
