Kingston a,*  aDepartment of Chemistry, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061-0212  blnstituto de Quimica, Universidade Estadual Paulista, CP 359, 14.800, Araraquam - SP, Brazil  Abstract: Four new piperidine alkaloids, leptophyllin A (4), 3-acetylleptophyllin A (5), leptophyllin  B (8). and (-)-spectaline (1), and 3 known piperidine alkaloids, (-)-spectalinine (2), canavaline (3),  and iso-6-canavaline (7), were isolated by a bioassay-guided fractionation of a leaf extract of Cassia  leptophylla. The alkaloids 1 - 3 were active in a inechanism-based DNA-modifying yeast assay and  2 was moderately active in Vero monkey and Chinese hamster ovary cell cytotoxicity assays.  Although piperidine alkaloids are abundant in nature and many of them are known to exhibit some  biological activity, 1 to the best of our knowledge none have been reported to show any effect on DNA. In our  search for potential anticancer agents employing a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for DNA-modifying  agents,2, 3 we have isolated (-)-spectaline (1), the enantiomer of the known (+)-spectaline (6), three known  piperidine alkaloids, (-)-spectalinine (2), canavaline (3), and iso-6-canavaline (7) and three new piperidine  alkaloids named leptophyllin A (4), 3-acetylleptophyllin A (5), and leptophyllin B (8), by a bioassay-guided  fractionation of a bioactive extract of the Brazilian legume, Cassia leptophylla. Of these, (-)-spectaline (1),  (-)-spectalinine (2) and canavaline (3) were found to be active in our bioassay. The alkaloids 1 and 2 also  showed cytotoxicity in the Vero monkey and Chinese hamster ovary cell cytotoxicity assays. In this paper we  report the structure elucidation, the assignment of IH and 13C NMR spectral data by application of 2D  techniques, and the biological evaluation of these seven piperidine alkaloids.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  A preliminary investigation of the bioactive CHC13/MeOH (2:1) extract of the leaves of C. leptophylla  indicated that the bioactivity was due to its alkaloidal constituents. Thus the alkaloidal fraction obtained in the  usual manner was subjected to CC on A1203 and the resulting fractions exhibiting bioactivity were further  separated by combined A1203 CC, Si gel prep TLC, and RP-TLC as necessary to afford seven alkaloids, the  structures of which were elucidated as described below. All seven alkaloids exhibited some common features  in their MS, 1H and 13C NMR spectra (see Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The presence of significant peaks  at m/z 114 and 96 in their FABMS were characteristic of a piperidine bearing methyl, hydroxyl and alkyl  functionalities. 4-6 These groups in the piperidine ring were located at C-2, C-3 and C-6, respectively, based  on their 1H and 13C NMR data.  5929  5930  V. DA S. BOLZANI et aL  The least polar alkaloid, C20H39NO2 (HRFABMS), [~]D - 8.2 °, in addition to the general characteristics  indicated above, had a peak at m/z 265 in its MS which may be assigned to the fragment e (Table 1)  suggesting that it has a C14 alkyl side chain with an oxo function, the presence of which was confirmed by its  IR (Vmax 1720 cm-1), and 13C NMR (5 209.3 s) spectra. The 13C NMR spectrum, interpreted with the aid of  the DEPT spectrum, indicated the presence of one quaternary C, three CH's, fourteen CH2's, and two CH3's.  One of the CH3 carbons appeared at ~ 29.8 suggesting that the molecule contained a COCH3 group. From the  foregoing the structure 1 was inferred for this alkaloid. The 2D NMR data (DQCOSY, HETCOR and HMBC)  supported the structure 1 proposed for this alkaloid and enabled assignment of the 1H and 13C NMR signals  due to the piperidine ring and some fragments of the long alkyl chain. Thus in the HETCOR spectrum, the  methine signal at 6c 55.7 (C-2) correlated with the dq at 6H 2.72, whilst the methine signal at 8c 57.2 (C-6)  correlated with the multiplet at ~H 2.50; the methyl signal at 8c 29.8 showed a correlation with the signal at 8rl  2.16. The HMBC spectrum showed IH-13C correlations (Fig. 1) which were useful in the assignment of 1H  and 13C NMR signals of the piperidine nucleus, the C-2-Me, and some portions of the side chain. The 1H and  13C NMR assignments for 1 are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

The relative configurations of the chiral carbons C-2, C-3, and C-6 in the piperidine ring of 1 were  assigned mainly on the basis of 1H coupling data obtained from its 1H and DQCOSY NMR spectra and  comparison of these data with those reported for related piperidines. 7 It is known that in the absence of any  bulky substituents in the piperidine ring, the C-3-OH group prefers the axial orientation which allows it to  form an intramolecular H-bond with the lone-pair of electrons on N. 8,9 This was reflected in the IR spectrum  of 1 in CC14 which showed a large H-bonded OH stretch signal at 3350 cm -1, similar to those shown by  cassine 10 and speetaline (8). 9 The 1H and 13C NMR data for 1 were almost identical with those reported for  spectaline. 9 However, the [Ct]D for 1 was determined to be -8.2 ° whereas that reported for spectaline is +8.0 °,  indicating that alkaloid 1 is the enantiomer of spectaline, i.e. (-)-spectaline. Comparison of the 13C NMR data  for 1 with those of (+)-spectaline (8) 9 showed a discrepancy in the literature assignments for C-2, C-6, and C-  14 and these have now been revised based on HETCOR and HMBC data (see Table 2).

Alkaloid 2, C20H41NO2 (HRFABMS), [Ct]D - 8.6 °, whilst having the general spectral characteristics of a  2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine alkaloid, showed peaks at m/z 267 and 249 in its MS due to the fragments f and  g respectively (Table 1), suggesting the presence of a hydroxy group in the side chain. The 1H NMR spectrum  was found to be similar to that reported for (-)-spectalinine. 11 As 13C NMR assignments for spectalinine have  not been reported previously, spectral assignment was undertaken with the aid of HETCOR, DEPT, HMBC  and COLOC techniques. 13C NMR assignments for (-)-spectalinine (2) are given in Table 3.

Spectral data (MS, 1H and 13C NMR) of the next most polar alkaloid, C18H37NO2 (HRFABMS),  closely resembled those of alkaloid 2 except that they indicated that it had two fewer CH2 units in the side  chain compared with 2 [MS (Table 1) and 13C NMR (Table 3) evidence]. The comparison of 1H NMR (Table  2), MS data and [Ct]D of this alkaloid with canavaline (3) 4 confirmed its identity.  Spectral data for alkaloid 4, CI3H38NO3 (HRFABMS), [tX]D + 2.5 °, indicated it to be new and it was  therefore named leptophyllin A.  The presence of a 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-alkylpiperidine nucleus was  apparent from its MS fragmentation (Table l) and IH NMR data (Table 2). The MS, in addition to the general  fragments depicted in Table 1, showed two prominent peaks at m/z 284 and 254 corresponding, respectively,  to the loss of CH2OH and CH(OH)CH2OH fragments from M +. The 1H NMR spectra, analyzed with the help  of its DQCOSY spectrum, indicated the presence of two spin systems in addition to those due to the  substituted piperidine ring, appearing at 8 3.69 m, 3.62 dd, and 3.40 dd and attributable to the side chain.  Furthermore, the 13C NMR spectrum, analyzed with the aid of DEPT and HETCOR spectra, showed the  presence of oxygenated methine (~C 72.2) and methylene (~2 66.8) carbons. The foregoing suggested the  presence of a 1,2-glycol system at the terminus of the side chain. The presence of this system as well as the  Piperidine alkaloids from Cassia leptophylla  5933  2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-alkylpiperidine structural moiety was confirmed by the HMBC spectrum. The HMBC  correlations observed for the side chain of 4 were similar to those observed for 5 (Fig. 1). Based on the above  observations, along with analysis of its I3C NMR spectrum, leptophyllin A was identified as 2(S)-methyl  6(R)-(1 l',12'-dihydroxydodecyl)piperidin-3(S)-ol (4). The stereochemical dispositions of the groups at C-2,  C-3, and C-6 in 4 were deduced from the corresponding IH NMR coupling constants.8,9 However, it was not  possible to assign the configuration of C(11)-OH due to the limited quantity of 4 available.  A minor alkaloid was also isolated from the crude CC fraction which contained 4. This alkaloid had tH  and 13C NMR spectral characteristics similar to 4 except that it contained an acetyl function [SH 2.09 s (3H);  ~c 171.0 (s) and 21.3 (q)] and appeared to be a monoacetyl derivative of 4. The downfield shifts observed for  H-3 and C-3 in its tH and t3C NMR spectra respectively indicated it to be 3-acetylleptophyllin A (5). This  structure was fully corroborated by MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HMBC spectra. Some important HMBC  correlations observed are depicted in Fig. 1.  The physical data of the next most polar alkaloid, C17H35NO2, agreed well with those reported for iso-  6-canavaline (7). 11 The most polar alkaloid, C14H33NO3 (HRFABMS), [Ct]D -3.3 o, named leptophyllin B,  had a singlet at ~C 182.8 in its 13C NMR spectrum, indicating the presence of a CO2H group. Evidence for  the attachment of CO2H to the terminal carbon of the side chain was obtained by analysis of its 1H NMR  spectrum, which had a triplet due to 2H at ~H 2.46 (Table 2). The MS, 1H and 13C NMR spectral data (Tables  1, 2, and 3, respectively) were compatible with the structure 8 proposed for this alkaloid.  The biological activity data for the alkaloids 1-3, 7, and 8 in our mechanism-based yeast mutant  bioassays 2,3 are summarized in Table 4. Alkaloids 1 - 3 showed selective activities in RS 322YK and RS  321N assays compared with the wild-type RS 188N strain. Cytotoxic activities of 1 and 2 were evaluated in  two cell lines (Table 4). (-)-Spectalinine (2) was found to be moderately active in both cytotoxicity assays.  Compound  Table 4.

These are identical to those reported in ref. 3; the IH and 13C  NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 400 spectrometer at 400 and 100.57 MHz, respectively, with  TMS as internal standard; DQCOSY, DEPT, HETCOR, COLOC, and HMBC NMR experiments were  performed on the same spectrometer, using standard Varian pulse sequences; IR spectra were obtained on a  Perkin-Elmer 727B spectrophotometer; for CC, m1203 (neutral) grade III was used; TLC and PTLC involved  neutral A1203, Si gel and Whatman LKC18F plates; visualization on TLC was by spraying with Dragendorff  and iodoplatinate reagents.  5934  V.

The semi-dried leaves of C. leptophylla Vog. (3.5 kg) were  extracted with cold CHC13-MeOH (2:1), concentrated, redissolved in CHCI 3 and the CHC13 soluble fraction  was extracted (x 3) with 2N aqueous HC1. The aqueous extracts were pooled, basified (pH = 9) with NH4OH,  and successively extracted with CHC13 and EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were dried (Na2SO4) and  evaporated to yield the crude alkaloidal mixture (256 mg). This was subjected to CC on A1203; elution with  mixtures of CH2CI2-MeOH of increasing polarity afforded 4 crude fractions containing alkaloids. Fraction 1  was further separated by CC on A1203 (solvent gradient, 1 - 10% EtOAc in CH2C12) followed by RP-TLC  (20% H20 in MeOH) to furnish 1 (5.0 rag) and 2 (8.0 mg). Fraction 2 was submitted to Si gel PTLC (5%  MeOH in CH2C12, triple elution) to afford 3 (2.8 mg). From fraction 3 were isolated 4 (1.8 rag), 5 (4.8 mg),  and 7 (9.8 mg) by CC on A1203 (solvent gradient, 1 - 10% EtOAc in CH2C12). Purification of fraction 4 by  RP-TLC (10% H20 in MeOH) afforded pure 8 (2.8 mg).  (-),Spectaline (1).
