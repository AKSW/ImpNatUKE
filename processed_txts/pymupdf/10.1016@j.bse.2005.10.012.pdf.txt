Mart. yielded three new dammarane triterpenes 20S,24S-epoxy-7b,25-dihydroxy-3,4- secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid, 20S,24S-epoxy-7b,15a,25-trihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid and 20S,24R-epoxy- 7b,22x,25-trihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid, which were identiﬁed on the basis of spectroscopic methods. The known dammarane triterpenes ocotillone, eichlerianic acid, shoreic acid and the sterols sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, sitos- tenone and stigmast-5-en-3-one were also isolated and identiﬁed. The branches yielded the above three known dammaranes and eichlerialactone. The dammaranes in C. canjerana display strong similarities with Trichilieae tribe, which contains several dam- maranes. The data reported herein thus provide ﬁrm support for placing Cabralea within the subfamily Melioideae, Trichilieae tribe. � 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction The Meliaceae is a medium-sized family of woody plants of the tropics and subtropics of both hemispheres, com- prising 51 genera and probably no more than 550 species. Harms (1940) divided the Meliaceae into three subfamilies in the following way: Cedreloideae (two tribes: Cedreleae and Ptaeroxyleae), Swietenioideae and Melioideae (ﬁve tribes: Carapeae, Turraeeae, Vavaeeae, Melieae and Trichilieae). Pennington and Styles (1975) excluded Ptaeroxyleae from the family, included Harms’ tribes Cedreleae and Carapeae into the subfamily Swietenioideae and divided Harms’ tribe Trichilieae into four tribes, Trichilieae, Aglaieae, Guareeae and Sandoriceae. Chemically, the family Meliaceae is distinguished by the frequent occurrence of limonoids, whose precursor de- grades to four major routes, oxidative opening of ring D to give the D-seco limonoids, of ring B and D to give the mexicanolide types, of ring B and A to give the A,B-seco limonoids and of ring C to give the C-seco limonoids or * Corresponding author.

The mexicanolide group occurs widely in the genera of the Swietenioideae. The Melioideae appears to be the most proliﬁc in production of A,B-seco limonoids but relatively poor in mexicano- lide types. The C-seco limonoids have so far been recorded in four genera of the Melioideae (Turrea, Trichilia, Melia, and Azadirachta). Chemically, the Swietenioideae and Melioideae are clearly distinguished. The difference in com- position of the limonoids in Harms’ tribe Trichilieae is not pronounced enough to corroborate Pennington and Styles’ separation of the genera into four tribes (da Silva et al., 1984, 1987). Thus, expansion of knowledge on Trichilieae, Aglaieae, Guareeae and Sandoriceae is necessary, particularly to support Pennington and Styles’ suggestion. As part of a continuing study of the chemistry of the Meliaceae we have examined branches and stem of previously uninves- tigated Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. in order to obtain phytochemical evidence permitting a better understanding of its chemotaxonomic position in the Harms’ tribe Trichilieae or Guareeae. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. General NMR: on a Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as internal standard; HRMS were obtained on a Fisons VG Autospec; IR: Bomen-Ft/IR; [a]D: Perkin Elmer 241 instrument. 2.2. Plant material C. canjerana was collected in Federal University of Vic¸osa, MG, Brazil, and identiﬁed by T. D. Pennington, from the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew-UK. A voucher (1842; 1983) is deposited in the Herbarium of Departamento de En- genharia Floresta, Dendrologia, Universidade Federal de Vic¸osa, MG, Brazil. 2.3. Isolation of compounds Ground branches (228 g) and stem (1.5 kg) from C. canjerana were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally with MeOH at room temperature for three times. The concentrated hexane extract from branches was subjected to CC over silica gel (230e400 mesh). Elution from hexane to EtOAc yielded ocotillone (16.6 mg) and a mixture of 4 and 5 (35.8 mg). The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract from branches was subjected to CC over silica gel (230e400 mesh). Elu- tion with hexaneeEtOAc gradient yielded 11 frs. Fr.4 was rechromatographed as above, eluting with hexaneeMe2CO to afford a mixture of 4 and 5 (15.3 mg). Fr. 8 was twice rechromatographed over silica gel (230e400 mesh, hexanee Me2CO 20:7; hexaneeMe2CO 20:5) yielding eichlerialactone (3.0 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract from branches was puriﬁed by repeated column chromatography as above to give ocotillone (41.0 mg) and a mixture of 4 and 5 (10.3 mg). The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract from the stem was subjected to CC over silica gel (230e400 mesh). Elution with hexaneeCH2Cl2eMe2CO gradient yielded ocotillone (40.0 mg), a mixture of 4 and 5 (12.3 mg) and an amorphous solid characterized by GCeMS and 13C NMR as a mixture (313 mg) of sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, sitos- tenone and stigmast-5-en-3-one. The concentrated MeOH extract from the stem was submitted to vacuum chromatog- raphy over silica gel (70e230 mesh) using a hexaneeCH2Cl2eEtOAceMeOH gradient giving four frs, fr-hexane, fr-CH2Cl2, fr-EtOAc and fr- MeOH. Fr-EtOAc was subjected to CC over silica gel (230e400 mesh). Elution with hexaneeCH2Cl2eMe2CO gradient yielded 14 frs. Fr-EtOAc-3 was rechromatographed as above to afford 1 (15.1 mg). Fr-EtOAc-5 was rechromatographed as above to afford ocotillone (25.6 mg) and additional frs. Fr-EtOAc-5-3 was twice rechromatographed as above yielding, after ﬁnal puriﬁcation by lobar column (MERCK, hexaneeCH2Cl2eMe2CO gradient), compound 3 (7.0 mg). Fr-EtOAc-5-6 was rechromatographed as above, eluting with hexaneeMe2CO to afford ocotillone (160 mg), a mixture of 4 and 5 (43 mg) and a fr. containing 2. The last fr. was then rechromatographed as above yielding, after ﬁnal puriﬁcation by lobar column (MERCK, hexaneeCH2Cl2e Me2CO gradient), compound 2 (3.0 mg). 2.3.1. 20S,24S-epoxy-7b,25-dihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (1) Amorphous solid: [a]D 23 -16.1 � (CHCl3; c 0.0048); IR (liq. ﬁlm) nmax/cm�1: 3448, 2969, 2872, 1711, 1457, 1054; 1H NMR (400 MHz, C5D5N): see Table 1; 13C NMR (100 MHz, C5D5N): see Table 2; HMBC, NOESY, NOEDIF 283 P.A. de Campos Braga et al. / Biochemical Systematics and Ecology 34 (2006) 282e290 (400/100 MHz, C5D5N): see Table 3.

In addition to signals typical of a 20,24-epoxy-25-hydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)- en-3-oic acid (d 4.95, brs, H-28a; 4.99, brs, H-28b; six tertiary methyl groups, d 0.95, s, 3H, 1.15, s, 3H, 1.26, s, 3H, 1.33, s, 3H, 1.39, s, 3H, 1.46, s, 3H; a vinylic methyl d 1.83, s, 3H; an oxymethine d 3.96, dd, J ¼ 10.3 and 5.0 Hz, H- 24), the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed an oxymethine at d 4.05, dd, J ¼ 11.2 and 4.2 Hz. The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 1, permitted the assignments of all hydrogen and carbon atoms of the 20,24-epoxy-25- hydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic system (Table 2) in close agreement with those for 5. From HMBC exper- iments (Table 3), the correlation observed between the 1H signals for H-28a (d 4.95) and H-28b (d 4.99) and the 13C signals at d 48.6 and 23.5 (CH and CH3, respectively, by DEPT 135) led to their assignments as C-5 and C-29, respec- tively. The methyl proton at d 0.95 (dC 20.7 by HSQC) showed long-range correlations with the C-5 signal and the 13C signals at d 35.4 (CH2), 41.6 (CH) and 39.3 (quaternary), leading to their assignments as H3-19, C-1, C-9 and C-10, respectively. The C-1 signal (d 35.4) showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at d 2.00 m (2H) and was coupled to the 1H signals at d 2.71 (ddd, J ¼ 15.0, 11.5, 4.0 Hz) and 2.52 (ddd, J ¼ 15.0, 12.0, 6.0 Hz), and both of which also showed cross peaks with the 13C signal at d 29.2. These signals were then assigned to 2H-1, H-2a, H-2b and C-2, re- spectively. Moreover, the C-5 signal (d 48.6) showed one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at d 2.40 (dd, J ¼ 13.1, 2.8 Hz), which was coupled to the 1H signals at d 2.26 (td, J ¼ 13.1, 11.2 Hz) and 1.86 m, and both of which were also coupled to the oxymethine signal at d 4.05 (dd, J ¼ 11.2 and 4.2 Hz), thus indicating a hydroxyl group at C-7 (dC 72.9 by HSQC) and permitting the assignment of the above signals to H-5, H-6ax, H-6eq and H-7, respectively. These as- signments were supported by TOCSYexperiments. Orientation of the hydroxyl followed from the large coupling con- stant between H-7 and H-6ax at d 2.26 (td, J ¼ 13.1, 11.2 Hz) which requires H-7 to be in an axial conformation (a). The methyl proton at d 1.33 showed long-range correlations with the C-7 (d 72.9), C-9 (d 41.6) signals and the 13C signals at d 46.1 and 50.3 (quaternaries), leading to their assignments as H3-18, C-8 and C-14 (or C-14 and C-8), and conﬁrming a hydroxyl group at C-7. A comparison of 13C chemical shifts of dammaranes indicated that C-14 (ca d 50) resonates at a lower ﬁeld than C-8 (ca d 46). The signals at d 46.1 and 50.3 were then assigned to C-8 and C-14, re- spectively. A second methyl proton at d 1.15 showed also long-range correlations with the C-8 and C-14 signals and the 13C signals at d 35.6 (CH2), which were assigned to H3-30 and C-15, respectively. The HR-mass spectrum gave a signiﬁcant fragment at m/z 143.1064 (C8H15O2) conﬁrming the presence of a side chain of the same type as that of eichlerianic acid (5). In the NOEDIFF experiments (Table 3) irradiation of the H-24 signal did not inﬂuence Me-21, showing NOEs only to Me-27 (or Me-26). These observations suggested the H-24 to be anti (a) to Me-21 (b). More- over, compound 1 was characterized as 20S,24S-epoxy-7b,25-dihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid from the chemical shift of C-24 (dC 87.4; dH 3.96, dd, J ¼ 10.3 and 5.0 Hz) and its comparison with those of 20S,24S- epoxy-25-hydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (5, eichlerianic acid, dC 86.2; dH 3.62, dd, J ¼ 10.0 and 5.5 Hz), and 20S,24R-epoxy-25-hydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (4, shoreic acid, dC 83.1; dH 3.71, t, J ¼ 7.7 Hz) (Hisham et al., 1996; Roux et al., 1998). The assignment of the relative conﬁguration of C-7 received further support between NOE of the H-7 and H3-30, supporting that hydroxyl group is thus in an equatorial conﬁguration (b) (Table 3). The HR-mass spectra of 2 and 3 indicated the molecular formula as C30H50O6 (m/z 506.3607), showing that both differed from 1 (C30H50O5) only by an extra oxygen. The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 2 and 3 permitted the assignments of all hydrogen and carbon atoms (Table 2) in close agreement with those for 1. In addition to signals typical of 1, the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 (Table 1) revealed an oxymethine at d 4.06, t, J ¼ 8.8 Hz. From HMBC ex- periments (Table 3), the observed correlation between the signal at d 0.98, assigned to H3-30 (dC 9.4), and the 13C signal at d 72.2 determined the position of a hydroxyl group at C-15. The C-15 signal (d 72.2) showed one-bond cor- relation with the 1H signal at d 4.06, which was attributed to H-15. The stereochemistry suggested for 2 was based on the biosynthesis of dammarane (da Silva et al., 1984, 1987), moreover, these were supported by the NOESYand NOE- DIFF experiments (Table 3). The NOEs of the H-15 at d 4.06, coming from H3-18, showed that the hydroxyl group at C-15 is thus in the a-face of the molecule. Thus, the structure of the new dammarane was characterized as 20S,24S- epoxy-7b,15a,25-trihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (2). In compound 3, the HR-mass spectrum showed a signiﬁcant fragment ion at m/z 159.1001, C8H15O3, assuming hydroxyl group to be located in the side chain. In addition to signals typical of 1, the 1H NMR spectrum of 3 (Table 1) revealed an oxymethine at d 4.07, t, J ¼ 5.8 Hz. From HMBC experiments (Table 3), the correlations observed be- tween the signals at d 3.65, assigned to H-24 (dC 81.7), d 1.16, assigned to H-21 (dC 19.2), and the 13C signal at d 75.6 determined the position of a hydroxyl group at C-22. Furthermore, the shielded resonance observed for C-24 in compound 3 (dC 81.7; dH 3.65, t, J ¼ 7.3 Hz) is not typical of 1 and 5, but of 4 (4, shoreic acid, dC 83.1; 286 P.A. de Campos Braga et al. / Biochemical Systematics and Ecology 34 (2006) 282e290 dH 3.71, t, J ¼ 7.7 Hz) (Hisham et al., 1996; Roux et al., 1998). The slightly negative g effect of the hydroxy group at C-22 caused an upﬁeld shift for C-24 in 3, when compared with 4. The NOESYand NOEDIFF experiments (Table 3) did not facilitate elucidation of the relative conﬁguration of C-22 and C-24. However, the data were consistent with the structure of 20S,24R-epoxy-7b,22x,25-trihydroxy-3,4-secodammar-4(28)-en-3-oic acid (3). The dichloromethane extract of the stem yielded ocotillone (Rao et al., 1975a), a mixture of 4 and 5 and a mixture of sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, sitostenone and stigmast-5-en-3-one. The hexane and methanol extracts of the branches afforded ocotillone and a mixture of 4 and 5. The dichloromethane extract of the branches also afforded a mixture of 4 and 5 and eichlerialactone (Rao et al., 1975b). 4. Conclusion Cabralea is known to contain D-seco limonoids (seeds: gedunain, 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin, 7-deacetoxy-7- hydroxygedunin, 7-deacetoxy-7-hydroxyphotogedunin; Rao et al., 1975b), B,D-seco limonoids (seeds: methyl ango- lensate; Rao et al., 1975b), mexicanolides (seeds: ﬁssinolide, 3-deacetyl ﬁssinolide, cabralin and isocabralin; Zelnik, 1971; Rao et al., 1975b; wood: ﬁssinolide; Rao et al., 1975a) and dammarane triterpenes (seeds: cabraleone and cab- raleadiol; Rao et al., 1975b; fruits: cabraleone, cabraleadiol, cabralealactone and cabraleahydroxylactone; Cascon and Brown, 1972; wood: cabraleone, ocotillone, cabraleadiol, cabralealactone and cabraleahydroxylactone, eichlerianic acid, shoreic acid, dammarenolic acid and eichlerialactone; Rao et al., 1975a). Cabralea appears to produce limonoid types from the common precursor along only one pathway to mexicanolides (limonoids with intact carbon skele- ton / D-seco / B,D-seco limonoids / mexicanolides). Thus, the known limonoids from Cabralea are typical of the Swietenioideae subfamily (da Silva et al., 1984, 1987).

As already mentioned, the difference in composition of the limonoids in Harms’ tribe Trichilieae is not pronounced enough to corroborate Pennington and Styles’ separation of the genera into four tribes. This interpretation receives additional support from dammarane triterpenes (Tables 4 and 5), if indeed the data of ﬁve genera justify any comment. As a result of this study Cabralea has been shown to be proliﬁc in production of dammaranes but relatively poor in limonoids, reinforcing its position in the subfamily Me- lioideae, Harms’ tribe Trichilieae.
