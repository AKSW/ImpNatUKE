Abstract-A  benzene extract of the trunk wood of Aniba terminalis (Lauraceae) contained  besides  benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, d, 1 -camphor and sitosterol, (2S,3$3aR)- and (2R,3S,3aS)-3a-allyl-5-  methoxy-3-methyl-Zpiperonyl-2,3,3a,6-tetrahydrod-oxobenzofurans,  which  may  be  responsible,  through sequential rearrangements  of the Cope, retro-Claisen and Claisen types, and finally dehydro-  genation, for the formation of the co-occurring (2S,3S,5S)- and (2R,3S,5R)-5-allyl-5-methoxy-3-methyl-  2-piperonyl-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofurans,  the  (2S,3S)-6-0-allyl-5-methoxy-3-methyl-2-piper-  onyl-2,3_dihydrobenzofuran,  the (2S,3S)- and (2R,3S)-7-allyl-6-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-methyl-Zpiper-  onyl-2,3_dihydrobenzofuran  and the 7-allyl-6-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-methyl-2-piperonylbenzofuran.  Neolignans of structural types 1, 2, 3 and 4 co-  occur in the C,H,-extract  of an Aniha sp. [l].  The opinion that all four represent natural pro-  ducts originating from an isoeugenol-eugenol  oxi-  dative dimer (type 1) by successive in viva rearran-  gements was based on the stability of derivatives  belonging to types 1 and 2 under extraction con-  ditions. Additional evidence stems from the fact  that in Aniba terminalis  representatives  of these  same types are accompanied  by 5. Dehydrogena-  tion of 2,3_dihydrobenzofurans  would  not be  expected  to occur during manipulation  of the  plant or extract, and a reasonable rationalization  of the biosynthetically  unusual placement of the  ally1 substituent in 5 involves a sequence of reac-  tions in which 2, 3 and 4 would function as inter-  mediates.  * Part  31 in the series “The Chemistry  of Brazilian  Laur-  aceae”.

The structures  of  the compounds belonging to types 14 were thus  deduced with ease. The particular  dienone sys-  tems of 1 and 2 were further characterized  by  I876  0. R. GOTTLIFB. M. L. DA SILVA and Z. S. Ft.KKvIKA  IR and UV spectra (v,,,;,~ 1645 and 1685 cm- ’ re-  spectively: i,,,,,lX 28.5 and 3 14 nm respectively). The  relative positibn of the O-ally1 and O-methyl sub-  stitucnts in 3 was inferred from considerations  concerning the biogenesis of the compound. Ana-  logous  evidence,  also  decisive  for  structural  assignments in the case of compounds  4 and 5,  was partially  confirmed  by determining  NMR  spectral modifications  due to acetylation  in the  latter case. Constancy of position of the aromatic  proton sin&let established the j?zeta-relationship of  H and  OH.  while diamagnetic  shifts of the  CH2-CH=  and OMe resonances established the  o~tho-relationship  of the ally1 and the methoxyl  data showed this compound  to belong to the  (2S,3S)-2-aryl-3-methyl  series of 2,3-dihydroben-  zofurans [1,2]. Product 4 was again a 1:1.2 mix-  ture of 4a (Me r 8.67) and 4b (Me 5 9.19). The  absolute stereochemical  assignments  in the for-  mulae were based solely on the probable interre-  lationship  of A. tc~~riG1u1i.s  constituents  of the  tl’ar1s-(la ---f 2a+3+4a)  and  the  cis-( I b--f  2b --+ 4b) series.
