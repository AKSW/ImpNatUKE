Merr. foram avaliados para  suas atividades in vitro contra linhagens de Plasmodium falciparum sensíveis a cloroquina 3D7,  Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB9000 e Leishmania donovani L82. Ensaios com células KB  foram também executados com o objetivo de se determinar o grau de toxicidade das substâncias  ativas contra os parasitas. Nove dos compostos apresentaram IC50 entre 0,3 e 11,6 µM contra  P. falciparum. Em contraste, um pequeno número de compostos mostrou atividade significativa  contra T. brucei rhodesiense e nenhum apresentou atividade contra L. donovani. Entre os alcalóides  três tiveram IC50 < 1,0 µM contra P. falciparum, enquanto que contra T. b. rhodesiense cinco  mostraram IC50 < 10 µM. A caracterização dos alcalóides, 1,3,5-triidróxi-4-metóxi-10-metil-2,8- bis(3-metilbut-2-enil)acridin-9(10H)-ona (1), 2,3-diidro-4,9-diidróxi-2-(2-hidróxipropan-2-il)- 11-metóxi-10-metilfuro[3,2-b]acridin-5(10H)-ona (2) e 3,4-diidro-3,5,8-triidróxi-6-metóxi-2,2,7- trimetil-2H-pirano[2,3-a]acridin-12(7H)-ona (3), é aqui discutida.

Eleven acridone alkaloids isolated from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. were examined for  in vitro activity against chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum 3D7, Trypanosoma brucei  rhodesiense STIB900 and Leishmania donovani L82. An assay with KB cells was developed in  order to compare in vitro toxicity of alkaloids with the selective action on the parasites. Nine of  the compounds had IC50 values ranging from 0.3 to 11.6 µM against P. falciparum. In contrast, a  small number of compounds showed significant activity against T. brucei rhodesiense and none had  activity against L. donovani. Among the alkaloids three had IC50 < 1.0 µM against P. falciparum,  whereas against T. b. rhodesiense five had IC50 < 10 µM. The characterization of the acridone  alkaloids, 1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-10-methyl-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10H)-one  (1), 2,3-dihydro-4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-11-methoxy-10-methylfuro[3,2-b] acridin-5(10H)-one (2) and 3,4-dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-2,2,7-trimethyl-2H- pyrano[2,3-a]acridin-12(7H)-one (3), is discussed, as well as the structure-activity relationship  of all compounds assayed. Isolation and spectral data of alkaloids 1-3 are described for the first  time although their citotoxicities to cancer cells have been described before. Keywords: antiparasitic acridone alkaloids, malaria, Swinglea glutinosa, Rutaceae Introduction Parasitic protozoa are the causative agents of human  and livestock diseases infecting hundreds of millions of  people every year and are collectively one of most important  causes of human misery.1 Human African trypanosomiasis  (HAT), or sleeping sickness, malaria, Chagas’ disease and  leishmaniasis are major health problems in many countries.  HAT promoted by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and  T. b. gambiense is endemic in over 30 African countries  threatening over 60 million people. HAT has reached  epidemic proportions in some countries, such as Angola,  southern Sudan, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of  Congo.2,3 Malaria has re-emerged as a major public health  problem over the past three decades mainly because of  the development of worldwide resistance of Plasmodium  dos Santos et al. 645 Vol. 20, No. 4, 2009 falciparum to chloroquine, a drug which formed the basis  for cheap and effective treatment and for prophylaxis of  this disease.4 Each year, approximately 300 to 500 million  malaria infections lead to over one million deaths. In many  endemic countries, malaria is responsible for economic  stagnation, lowering the annual economic growth in some  regions by up to 1.5%.5,6 Leishmaniasis is a disease caused  by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. According to WHO  88 countries are affected, with 350 million people at risk.  90% of cases of visceral leishmaniasis occur in India,  Sudan, Bangladesh and Brazil.7 Present chemotherapy  for these diseases is inadequate or toxic, or becoming  ineffective due to an increase in resistance.8 The family Rutaceae contains many secondary  metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, coumarins,  limonoids and lignans with a large spectrum of biological  activities.9 Studies showed that acridone alkaloids  are compounds with promising activity against P.  falciparum,10,11 and also have antiviral12 and antiproliferative  effects on cancer cell lines.13,14 The Asian genera Citrus  and Swinglea are members of the Rutaceae and are  included in the subfamily Aurantioideae. Citrus species  have been investigated and characterized by possessing  acridone alkaloids. These data stimulated an investigation  of Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. in a search for lead  acridones.  From the MeOH extract of the stem bark of S.  glutinosa three new acridone alkaloids were identified:  1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-10-methyl-2,8-bis(3- methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10H)-one (1), 2,3-dihydro- 4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-11-methoxy- 10-methylfuro[3,2-b]acridin-5(10H)-one (2) and  3,4-dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-2,2,7-trimethyl- 2H-pyrano[2,3-a]acridin-12(7H)-one (3). In addition,  eight known alkaloids were characterized by the analysis  of their NMR spectra and compared with reference data:  1,3,5-trihydroxy-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-10-methyl- 9-acridone (4),10 glycocitrine-IV (5),15 citrusinine-II (6),16  citrusinine-I (7),17 citibrasine (8),16 5-hydroxynoracronycine  (9),18 pyranofoline (10)19 and bis-5-hydroxynoracronycine  (11)20. These alkaloids were tested in vitro against  chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum 3D7, T. b. rhodesiense  STIB900, L. donovani L82 and their toxicity effects were  also evaluated on KB cells.  Antiparasitic Activities of Acridone Alkaloids from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr.  J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 646 Results and Discussion Compound 1 was isolated as an amorphous powder,  the molecular formula was determined as C25H29NO5 by  HRESIMS, showing an [M+H]+ peak at m/z 424.2124. The  UV absorptions bands at λmax/nm: 222, 265, 285, 332 and  410 nm, IR absorptions at νmax/cm-1: 3500 and 1625 cm and  the characteristic signal of a hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl  proton at d 14.42 in the 1H NMR spectra, exchangeable with  D2O, suggested the presence of a hydroxyl group. These  data together with analyses of the 13C NMR spectrum,  suggested that compound 1 had a 1-hydroxy-9-acridone  framework.16-22  The 1H NMR spectrum of the compound 1 showed  two AB type aromatic protons at d 7.17 (1 H, d, J 8.0Hz,  H-6) and 6.96 (1H, d, J 8.0Hz, H-7), one N-methyl group  at d 3.74 and one O-methyl group at d 3.76. Also signals  of two trisubstituted double bonds at d 5.41(1H, m, H-2''),  5.31 (1H, m, H-2'), two methylene protons at d 4.01 (2H,  d, J 7.0Hz, H-1’’), 3.40 (2H, d, J 7.0Hz, H-1’), the former  protons being deshielded by the 9-carbonyl group, and four  vinyl methyl groups [d 1.80 (3H,d, J 0.9Hz, H-4’ E), 1.65  (3H,d, J 1.0Hz, H-5’ Z), 1.74 (3H,d, J 0.9Hz, H-4’’ E), 1.69  (3H,d, J 1.0Hz, H-5’’ Z)] were observed, which suggested the  presence of two prenyl groups (3-methylbut-2-enyl). Their  positions were confirmed at C-2 and C-8 by HMBC.  The position of a prenyl group at C-2 was confirmed by  the correlation of the methylene protons at d 3.40 (H-1') with  C-1 (d 158.1), C-2 (d 109.4), C-3 (d 156.1), C-2' (d 123.6)  and C-3' (d 131.4) in the HMBC spectrum. In addition, the  correlation of 1-OH at d 14.42 with C-1 and C-9a (d 107.6)  confirmed that the first prenyl group was attached to C-2.  The position of the second prenyl group was confirmed by  the correlation of the deshielded methylene protons at d 4.01  (H-1'') with C-7 (d 125.4), C-8 (d 135.0), C-2'' (d 125.4) and  C-3'' (d 131.2), confirming that the second prenyl group was  attached to C-8. The N-methyl protons showed correlation  with C-4a and C-5a at d 140.2 and 139.4, respectively. The  O-methyl protons showed correlation with C-4 at d 128.8.  This value is consistent with the acridone possessing an  O-methyl group at C-4.17,23 Based on these data, the structure  of 1 was characterized as 1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-10- methyl-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10H)-one.  Table 1 shows the data of 1H, 13C NMR and correlations  observed in the HMBC experiment. Compound 2 was isolated as an amorphous powder, the  molecular formula C20H21NO6 was determined on the basis  of HRESIMS, exhibiting an [M+H]+ peak at m/z 372.1447.  The UV and IR spectra were identical to those of 1, however  some differences were observed in the 1H and 13C NMR.  In the 1H NMR spectrum, the characteristic signal of a  hydrogen-bonded hydroxy proton at d 14.42, exchangeable  with D2O suggested the presence of a hydroxyl group.  These data suggested that compound 2 had a 4-hydroxy- 5-acridone skeleton.16-22  The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 showed an ABX type  aromatic spin system at d 7.15 (1 H, t, J 7.8Hz, H-7), 7.29  (1H, dd, J 7.8, 1.4Hz, H-8) and 7.80 (1H, dd, J 7.8, 1.4Hz,  H-6), this last proton being deshielded by the 5-carbonyl  group. The spectrum also showed one N-methyl group at  d 3.85 and one O-methyl group at d 3.89. The presence of  a hydroxyisopropyldihydrofuran moiety was suggested by  an oxymethine proton at d 4.88 (1H, dd, J 9.4, 7.8Hz, H-2),  methylene protons as two dd in an AB system at d 3.20 (1H,  dd, J 15.5, 7.8Hz, H-3a) and 3.26 (1H, dd, J 15.5, 9.4Hz,  H-3b), two methyl groups at d 1.33 (3H, s, H-2') and 1.29  (3H, s, H-3'). The signal at d 93.0 and 71.5 in the 13C NMR  spectrum supported the presence of this substituent in the  acridone nucleus.23 Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR and HMBC data for compound 1 (acetone-d6) Position 13Ca d 1Hb d (mult., J in Hz) HMBCb (H-C) 1 158.1 1-OH 14.42 (s) C-1, C-2 2 109.4 3 156.1 4 128.8 4ª 140.2 5 147.3 5ª 139.4 6 120.0 7.17 (d, 8.0) C-5, C-8, C-5a 7 125.4 6.96 (d, 8.0) C-8a, C-1’’ 8 135.0 8a 123.6 9 185.5 9a 107.6 N-CH3 45.3 3.74 (s) C-4a, C-5a O-CH3 59.8 3.76 (s) C-4 1’ 22.4 3.40 (d, 7.0) C-1, C-2, C-3, C-3’, C-2’ 2’ 123.6 5.31 (m) C-4’, C-5’ 3’ 131.4 4’ 25.9 1.65 (d, 1.0) C-2’, C-3’, C-5’ 5’ 17.8 1.80 (d, 0.9) C-2’, C-4’, C-3’ 1’’ 34.3 4.01 (d, 7.0) C-7, C-8, C-2’’, C-3’’ 2’’ 125.4 5.41 (m) C-4’, C-5’’ 3’’ 131.2 4’’ 25.9 1.74 (d, 0.9) C-2’’, C-3’’, C-5’’ 5’’ 18.0 1.69 (d, 1.0) C-2’’, C-3’’, C-4’’ a Recorded at 100 MHz; b Recorded at 400 MHz. dos Santos et al. 647 Vol. 20, No. 4, 2009 The presence of a linear orientation of the  hydroxyisopropyldihydrofuran moiety was confirmed  by correlations of the methylene protons at d 3.20 (H-3)  with C-3a (d 109.4), C-2 (d 93.0) and C-1' d 71.5 and the  correlations of the 4-OH at d 14.31 with C-4a (d 108.4),  C-4 and C-3a in the HMBC spectrum. The spectrum also  showed the correlation of the signals of the N-methyl  protons at d 3.85 with d 143.5 and 138.0 assigned to C-11a  and C-9a, respectively. The O-methyl proton at d 3.89  showed correlation with C-11 at d 126.6. The correlation  at H-6, H-7 and H-8 in the HMBC spectrum allowed the  assignments of the carbons C-9, C-9a, C-8, C-7, C-6,  C-5a and C-5. Based on the above evidence, compound  2 could be defined as 2,3-dihydro-4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2- hydroxypropan-2-yl)-11-methoxy-10-methylfuro[3,2-b] acridin-5(10H)-one. Table 2 shows 1H, 13C NMR data for  2 and the correlations observed in the HMBC. Compound 3 was isolated as an amorphous powder,  the molecular formula was determined as C20H21NO6 by  HRESIMS, showing an [M + H]+ peak at m/z 372.1447.  The UV absorption band at λmax 265, 285, 332 and  410 nm, IR absorptions at νmax 3509 and 1620 cm-1 and  comparison with 1H and 13C NMR data characterized an  acridone nucleus.16-22 The lack of a characteristic signal  of hydrogen-bonded hydroxy proton in the 1H NMR  spectrum, in acetone-d6 and DMSO-d6, and the shielded  value of C-12 at d 177.7 in the 13C NMR spectrum  suggested that there is no intramolecularly hydrogen- bonded hydroxyl group as observed for 1 and 2. The  1H NMR spectrum showed an ABX type aromatic spin  system at d 7.04 (1H, t, J 7.8Hz, H-10), 7.15 (1H, dd, J  7.8, 1.5Hz, H-9) and 7.64 (1H, dd, J 7.8, 1.5 Hz, H-11).  The spectrum also showed one N-methyl group at d  3.65 and one O-methyl group at d 3.77. The presence  of a 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyldihydropyran moiety was  suggested by an oxymethine signal at d 3.88 (1H, m,  H-3), two methylene protons Ha at d 3.00 (1H, dd, J 16.8,  5.7Hz, Ha-4), Hb 2.61 (1H, dd, J 16.8, 7.8Hz, Hb-4) and  two methyl groups at d 1.43 (3H, s, H-1') and 1.28 (3H, s,  H-2'). The resonances at d 69.1 and 78.1 in the 13C NMR  spectrum supported the presence of this substituent on  the acridone nucleus.  In the HMBC spectrum of 3, the methylene protons  at d 2.61 (H-4) showed correlations with C-4a (d 103.9),  C-5 (d 153.3), C-3 (d 69.1) and C-2 (d 78.1), indicating  that the substituent was located at an angular position.  This spectrum also showed the correlation of the  N-methyl protons at d 3.65 with C-6a (d 143.2) and  C-7a (d 137.1). The O-methyl protons at d 3.77 showed  correlation with C-6 at d 130.4; this value is consistent  with an acridone having an O-methyl group in this  position.17,23 Correlations of H-9, H-10 and H-11 allowed  the assignments of the carbons C-8, C-8a, C-9, C-10,  C-11, C-11a and C-12. Therefore, compound 3 was  identified as 3,4-dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy- 2,2,7-trimethyl-2H-pyrano[2,3-a]acridin-12(7H)- one. Table 3 shows the data of 1H, 13C NMR and the  correlation observed in the HMBC. The eleven acridone alkaloids isolated from S. glutinosa  were tested for in vitro activity against P. falciparum, T.  b. rhodesiense and L. donovani. An assay with KB cells  indicated in vitro cytotoxicity. The results are summarized  in Table 4. To facilitate the discussion, IC50 values were  assigned as IC50 T,P,K against T. b. rhodesiense, P. falciparum  and KB cells, respectively. Nine out of the eleven acridone alkaloids showed IC50 P  below 10 µM, four showed IC50 T below 10 µM and none  displayed significant activity against L. donovani. Related acridone alkaloids from Thamnosma  rodesica (Bak. F.), showed activity against promastigote  and amastigote forms of Leishmania major.

Antiparasitic Activities of Acridone Alkaloids from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr.  J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 648 alkaloids have a methyl 2,3-dihydroxypropanoate chain  at C-3 and C-4,23 indicating that the substitution in the  acridone skeleton is important for activity in this class  of compounds.  According to the data, compound 5, with one prenyl  group at C-2, was the most active against P. falciparum  with ICP 50 0.3 µM. Comparison of 5, 1 (ICP 50 2.6 µM) and 4  (ICP 50 2.6 µM) indicates that the second prenyl at C-8 was  responsible for reducing the activity of this series. This  fact was also observed by Weniger et al.,10 who performed  the assay with four alkaloids from S. glutinosa on a  Nigerian chloroquine-sensitive strain of P. falciparum.  Analysis of the results for compounds 2, 3, 9, 10 and 11  suggests that the presence of a pyran ring is important  for activity against P. falciparum and the position of this  group, angular pyrano[2,3-c] (9) or linear pyrano[3,2-b]  (10), did not alter the results of ICP 50.  The activity against P. falciparum observed for 6,  7 and 8, ICP 50 8.9, 29.9 and 6.1 µM, respectively, shows  that presence of an O-methyl group at C-2 improves  the activity.  From the 11 alkaloids tested against T. b. rhodesiense,  compound 9 was the most active with an ICT 50 1.0 µM.  Alkaloids 1-3 had their citotoxicity to cancer cells  described in an earlier paper,30 however here we disclose  for the first time their isolation, spectral data and structure  elucidation.

This  procedure was repeated 3 times to yield the crude hexane  extract. The residue was extracted, as above, using MeOH  to yield the crude MeOH extract. The crude MeOH extract  (60 g) was fractioned by VCC over 1 kg of silica gel 60  (70-239 mesh, Merck) eluted with 1.5 L of the solvents:  100% hexane (fraction 1), 100% CH2Cl2 (fraction 2), 3:1  CH2Cl2:MeOH (fraction 3); 2:1 CH2Cl2:MeOH (fraction 4);  1:1 CH2Cl2:MeOH (fraction 5) and 100% MeOH (fraction  5). Fractions 2 and 3 were combined and chromatographed  on silica gel using CH2Cl2 as mobile phase, the polarity  was increased by addition of 5%, 10%, 13%, 18%, 20%  and 25% of MeOH in a gradient system to yield 15  fractions. Lupeol was crystallized from fractions 1 to 3.  Fraction 5 was rechromatographed on Si gel, being eluted  with 1:3 n-hexane-acetone followed by Sephadex LH-20  with MeOH to give alkaloids 1 (16.3 mg), 4 (30.4 mg),  5 (3.5 mg), 8 (11.2 mg), 9 (13.4 mg), 10 (9.8 mg) and 11  (5.4 mg). Further purification of fraction 9 on Sephadex  LH-20 with MeOH and HPLC using MeOH as mobile  phase, UV detection at 254 and 365nm, and a flow rate of  3.0 mL min-1 afforded compounds 6 (13.5 mg), 7 (11.2 mg)  and 8 (7.3 mg). Fraction 10 was dissolved in MeOH and  submitted to Sephadex LH-20, being eluted with MeOH  to give compounds 2 (5.2 mg) and 3 (4.3 mg).  1,3,5-Trihydroxy-4-methoxy-10-methyl-2,8-bis(3- methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10H)-one, (1)  Amorphous powder, IR (liquid film) νmax/cm-1: 3500,  2964, 1625, 1566.

Biological assays Stock solutions of the compounds, plus control drugs,  were prepared at a concentration of 20 mg mL-1 in DMSO  (Sigma, UK), and diluted to appropriate concentrations  prior to assays. IC50 values were calculated with MSXLFIT  (IDBS, UK).  P. falciparum Chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum strain 3D7 was  maintained in human A+ erythocytes in RPMI 1640 medium  (Sigma, UK) supplemented with Albumax II at 37 ºC in a  5% CO2-air mixture. Asynchronous (65-75% ring stage)  of P. falciparum intraerythrocytic cultures were set up as  above, with 1% parasitemia, 2.5% hematocrit, in triplicate  in 100 µL of medium in 96 well, flat-bottomed Microtest  III tissue plates. Drugs were added in a threefold dilution  Antiparasitic Activities of Acridone Alkaloids from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr.  J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 650 series and cultures incubated for a total of 48 h at 37 ºC  in a 5% CO2-air mixture. After 24 h, {3H} hypoxanthine  (0.2 mCi) was added to each well.25,26 At the end of the  assay, plates were rapidly freeze-thawed, harvested using  a Tomtec Mach III cell harvester (Tomtec, CT) onto a 96- well format filtermat and MeltilexTM solid scintillant (both  Wallac, Finland) added prior to reading in a Microbeta 1450  scintillation counter (Wallac, Finland) at 1 min per well. T. brucei rhodesiense T. b. rhodesiense STIB900 bloodstream form  trypomastigotes were maintained in HMI-18 medium,27  with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Harlan Sera  Lab, UK) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-air mixture. Prior to  drugging, trypomastigotes were washed and resuspended  in fresh medium at a concentration 2 × 105 trypanosoma/mL   and 100 µL of this suspension was added to the drug  dilutions. The top concentration for the test compounds  was 30 mg mL-1. Pentamidine was included as the standard  drug. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 ºC in a 5% CO2- air mixture.28 At 72 h AlamarBlue was added to the plates.  Plates were read after 4-5 h on a Gemini fluorescent plate  reader (Sofimax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular Devices, UK) at  EX/EM 530/585 nm with a filter cut-off at 550 nm. L. donovani L. donovani L82 amastigotes were harvested from an  infected hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) spleen and used  to infect murine peritoneal exudate macrophages (PEM) at  a ratio of 7:1. In brief, infected cells were exposed to drug  for a total of 5 days.29 The percentage of infected cells was  evaluated microscopically and the percentage inhibition in  comparison with untreated controls was calculated.  Cytotoxicity assays 96-well plates were seeded with KB cells at 4 × 104 mL-1  (100 µL per well). Drugs at 300, 30, 3 and 0.3 µg mL-1  were added in fresh overlay after 24 h, in triplicate at each  concentration. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in  a 5% CO2-air mixture. At 72 h AlamarBlue was added  to the plates. Plates were read after 4-5 h on a Gemini  fluorescent plate reader (Sofimax Pro. 3.1.1, Molecular  Devices, UK) at EX/EM 530/585 nm with a filter cut-off  at 550 nm. IC50 values were calculated against the blanks  and control samples.
