Their effect on the electron transport chain on thylakoids was analyzed. Alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited ATP synthesis, basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled electron transport acting as Hill reaction inhibitors on spinach chloroplasts. Alkaloid 3 was not active. The inhibition and interaction site of alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 on the non-cyclic electron transport chain was studied by polarography and ﬂuorescence of the chlorophyll a (Chl a). The results indicate that the target for 1 was localized on the donor and acceptor side of PS II. In addition alkaloids 2 and 5 affect the PS I electron acceptors on leaf discs. � 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, it is becoming very difﬁcult to discover new leads structures solely by synthetic means [1]. Therefore, modern strategies for discovering new agrochemical, i.e. insecticides, herbicides, etc. are focused on natural products, because they often have a reduced environmental impact, are biodegradable and may have new sites of interaction and speci- ﬁcity. In a program oriented towards the discovery of novel photo- synthetic inhibitors, we identiﬁed diverse secondary metabolites such as chromenes, benzofurans, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, lac- tones, and terpenes from selected Mexican plants [2]. Furoquinoline alkaloids have attracted much interest due to their broad range of biological activities including various physiological and pharmaco- logical activities [3,4]. In a previous work bioactive constituents from Swinglea glutinosa (Rutaceae) [4–7], and from Hortia superba (Rutaceae) were isolated and characterized. Quinolone alkaloids, ﬂindersine, N-methyl-ﬂindersine and acridone alkaloids inhibit the light reactions of photosynthesis [8]. The acridone alkaloids that contain 2,3,5,6-dehydro-4-oxopiperidine nucleus were the most ac- tive. As a contribution on the research of the Rutaceae family, in this work we report the isolation of ﬁve furoquinoline alkaloids: evoli- trine (1), kokusaginine (2), c-fagarine (3), skimmianine (4) and mac- ulosidine (5) (Fig. 1) from a Brazilian tree Balfourodendron riedelianum. The plant is used in the Brazilian folk medicine to treat gastrointestinal ailments [9]. In the search for natural product that may have herbicide activity, we studied ﬁve furoquinoline alkaloids and found that four of them act as photosynthetic inhibitors. We investigated the mechanism of action of furoquinoline alkaloids 1– 5 on the light reaction of photosynthesis and their possible targets on the electron transport chain on thylakoids and leaves discs. Among the techniques suitable for assessing the electron transport ﬂow in the light reactions of photosynthesis on plants subjected to chemical stress, polarography (measuring oxygen evolution and using appropriate electron acceptors, donors and inhibitors) and ﬂuorescence induction curves of chlorophyll a of photosystem II (PS II) were employed in the present work. Chlorophyll a ﬂuores- cence data were analyzed by the ‘‘JIP-test analysis’’ [10]. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.

Stock solutions of 1–5 were prepared using DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) as solvent and its maximum concentration in the medium was less than 0.5%. Log P Parameters and Molar volume of the alkaloids were deter- mined for each compound by the program Chem stech from www.ACD labs.com. 2.2. Puriﬁcation and Isolation of the furoquinoline alkaloids (1–5) The dichloromethane extract (2.1 g) obtained from the stem barks of B. riedelianum was subjected to a counter current chroma- tography, in the RLCC (Rotation Locular Counter Chromatography, RLCC-1000, Eyela ceramic bomb VSP-3050) apparatus using chlo- roform/methanol/isopropanol/water (45:60:2:40), as stationary phase in an automatic collector (Eyela fraction collector DC-120). The apparatus loop was 3.0 mL to give a group of 24 fractions in a chloroform solution stationary phase (0.3626 g), which was subjected to a column over Sephadex LH-20 (430 mm � 30 mm, 300 g) and the elution was carried out with methanol (100%) to give 7 fractions. From the fraction 3 (0.0902 g) the alkaloid 3 was obtained and from the fraction 6 (0.0137 g) 1 and 2 were isolated, and the compound 4 was isolated from the fraction 5 (0.0437 g). These metabolites were identiﬁed by spectroscopic and spectro- metric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, including 2D experiments (HSQC and HMBC), the data were compared with previous report [12–14]. A solution of methanol/H2O (25%) of the methanol extract (58.6 g) obtained from the stem bark of Balfourodendrum riedelia- num and then subjected to a liquid extraction to get n-hexane (5.5 g), dichloromethane (26.4 g) and ethyl acetate (2.8 g) frac- tions. The dichloromethane fraction was subjected to a chromato- graphic column (silica ﬂash, 47.0 � 5.5 cm). The gradient elution was carried out with hexane to methanol, giving eleven fractions. The fraction 9 (1.45 g) gave rise to a new chromatographic column [silica ﬂash + ﬂorisil (1:1), 70.0 � 2.5 cm] with gradient of elution (hexane to methanol) providing seven fractions (I–VII). The frac- tion IV (0.95 g) was subjected to another silica ﬂash/Florisil (1:1) column (71.0 � 2.5 cm, eluted with gradient of hexane – ethyl ace- tate), giving ﬁve new fractions (A–E). The fraction E (0.06 g) was subjected to a preparative thin-layer chromatography (20 � 20 cm, 1 mm), eluted with dichloromethane (100%) to isolate maculosidine (5) (0.02 g). This compound was identiﬁed with spec- troscopic and spectrometric techniques: 1H and 13C NMR, as previ- ously reported [12–14]. 2.3. Chloroplasts isolation and chlorophyll determination Intact chloroplasts were isolated from spinach leaves (Spinacea oleracea L.) obtained from a local market as previously described [15,16]. Chloroplasts were isolated with a medium that contained: 400 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and buffered with 3 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, then they were re-suspended in the same medium and stored as a concentrated suspension in the dark for 1 h at 0 �C. 2.4. Measurement of ATP synthesis To measure ATP synthesis, intact chloroplasts (20 lg/mL of chlorophyll) were broken by osmotic rupture in the following low-buffered solution: 100 mM sorbitol, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM KCN, 50 lM methylviologen (MV) (as electron acceptor at FX level), 1 mM K+-tricine (pH 8.0), and 1 mM ADP, pH adjusted to 8.0 with KOH. The ATP synthesis was determined titrimetrically using a microelectrode Orion model 8103 Ross connected to a Corning potentiometer model 12, with expanded scale as previ- ously reported [15,17]. The linear rate of alkalization in the light was calibrated by back-titration with saturated HCl, the ATP formed was calculated as lmol ATP mg Chl�1 h�1. 2.5. Measurement of non-cyclic electron transport rate The Light-induced non-cyclic electron transport activity from water to MV was determined with an oxygen monitors YSI (Yellow Springs Instrument) model 5300 using a Clark type electrode as previously published [15,18]. Chloroplasts (equivalent of 20 lg/mL of chlorophyll) were freshly lysed in 3 mL of the basal electron transport reaction med- ium: 100 mM sorbitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM KCN, 30 mM K+-tricine at pH 8.0, and 50 lM MV and measured the basal electron ﬂow by polarography. Phosphorylating non-cyclic elec- tron transport from water to MV was measured as basal non-cyclic electron transport medium except that 1 mM ADP and 3 mM KH2- PO4 were added to the reaction medium. Uncoupled electron trans- port from water to MV was tested as the basal non-cyclic electron transport, and 6 mM NH4Cl was added as uncoupler to the med- ium. All reaction mixture was illuminated for 1 min with an actinic light of a projector lamp (GAF 2660) passed through a 5 cm ﬁlter of CuSO4 at 2% w/v.

Uncoupled photosystem II (PS II) and Uncoupled photosystem I (PS I) electron ﬂow determination Uncoupled PS II from water to 2,5-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) [19] was monitored polarographically. DCBQ accepts elec- trons at the D1 protein, and thus we measured the electron trans- port from water to QB. The reaction medium for assaying PS II activity was the same used for basal electron transport, except that MV was omitted and 1 lM 2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4- benzoquinone (DBMIB), 100 lM DCBQ and 6 mM NH4Cl were added. Partial reaction of PS II electron transport from water to so- dium silicomolybdate (SiMo) was determined as in PS II with the same basal electron transport medium without MV, and 50 lM SiMo and 10 lM 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) were added [20]. These electron ﬂow activities were monitored with a yellow spring instrument (YSI) oxygen monitor, model 5300 using a Clark type electrode. Uncoupled PS I electron transport was determined using the basal electron transport medium, plus 10 lM DCMU (to inhibit PSII at QB level), 100 lM of dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) were re- duced with 300 lM ascorbate and uncoupled with 6 mM NH4Cl [21]. The I50 value for each activity was extrapolated using the graph of percentage of activity versus concentration of compounds. I50 is the concentration producing 50% inhibition of the activity. 2.7. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence of PS II measurements in thylakoids Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence transients were measured with a Handy-PEA (Plant Efﬁcient Analyzer, from Hansatech, King’s Lynn, Norfolk, UK) as previously described [16]. The maximum ﬂuores- cence yield from the sample was generated by illumination for 2 s with continuous light (650 nm peak wavelength, intensity equivalent of 2830 lmol photons m�2 s�1 and gain of 0.7.) pro- vided by an array of three light-emitting diodes. The reaction med- ium used was that employed in basal non-cyclic electron transport measurements with MV. To monitor Chl a ﬂuorescence transients, aliquots of dark-adapted thylakoids for 5 min containing 60 lg of Chl were transferred to ﬁlter paper by gravity with a dot-blot appa- ratus (Bio-Rad, United States) in order to ensure a homogeneous and reproducible distribution of thylakoids. The ﬁlter paper was dipped immediately in 3 mL of the medium with different concen- trations of the tested compounds, and the control contained med- ium plus the amount of DMSO employed for each compound at the different used concentrations. Chloroplasts inﬁltrated with 10 lM DCMU and chloroplasts pre- viously treated with 0.8 M Tris ((hydroxymetyl)-aminomethan) were used as positive control. Chloroplasts were incubated with slight agitation for 30 min at 4 �C with 0.8 M Tris at pH 8.0 [22]. The OJIP transients were analyzed according to the JIP test and the measured parameters were: ﬂuorescence intensity level (Fo) when plastoquinone electron acceptor pool (QA) is fully oxidized and ﬂuorescence level when QA is transiently fully reduced (FM). F1 is the ﬂuorescence intensity level at 0.05 ms, F2 at 0.1 ms, F3 at 0.3 ms, F4 or FJ at 2 ms, F5 at 30 ms. Area is the area over the curve between Fo and FM, and relates the pool size of PS II electron trans- port acceptors [23]. From these parameters other derived parame- ters were calculated (Table 1) with the program Biolyzer HP3 (from Laboratory University of Geneva; available at http://www. unige.ch/sciences/biologie/bioen). The ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a transients were normalized using the equation Vt = (Ft � Fo)/ FM � Fo), and the difference between the treated and control normalized transients is called ‘‘relative variable ﬂuorescence’’, if plotted versus time revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band near to 2 ms, is an indication of the Q � A concentration is increased [10]. VOJ is the relative variable ﬂuorescence between Fo and FJ and is calculated as VOJ (t) = FVt/(FJ � Fo) = (Ft � Fo)/(FJ � Fo) and plotted versus time. If a K-band appeared near to 0.3 ms indicate a damaged in the water splitting system on thylakoids [10]. 2.8. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence measurements in spinach leaf discs Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence on discs from dark-adapted spinach leaf was measured with the same equipment and conditions used for thylakoids. Fifteen spinach leaf discs (7 mm diameter) were placed in each Petri dishes with 10 mL of modiﬁed Krebs solution which contained: 115 mM NaCl, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM Na2SO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 25 mM NaHCO3 (pH 7.4), then were incubated for 4 h at room tempera- ture, after this time, different concentrations of compound was added to each Petri dish. The leaf discs were incubated for 4 h more in the presence of the compounds, then, they were dark adapted for 30 min and afterwards the ﬂuorescence of the chlorophyll a was measured. The same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used for the samples treated with the analyzed compounds was added to the control samples for eliminating the solvent effect. 2.9. Plant material for in vivo assays The seeds of Physalis ixocarpa and Lolium perenne, a weed spe- cies, were sown in 12 cm diameter pots and were watered daily in the greenhouse at 25–30 �C. After 15 and 18 days of emergence for P. ixocarpa and L. perenne, respectively, the plants were selected for similar size and were sprayed manually with the compounds 1 and 2 at concentrations of 150 and 300 lM. A stock of 20 mM of each compound was prepared in DMSO and an aliquot of this solu- tion was taken to obtain the desired concentration in an aqueous suspension containing 0.05% w/v of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). The control group was sprayed with dis- tilled water containing the same amount of DMSO and Tween-20. 2.10. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence determination in intact leaves in vivo This was performed at room temperature with a portable Handy PEA apparatus [11] in the leaves of dark adapted-plants for 15 min both on the control and on the treated plants after 24, 40 and 72 h of being sprayed with the compounds. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Inhibition of ATP synthesis To know the effect of the furoquinoline alkaloids 1–5 on photo- phosphorylation, they were assayed on freshly lysed spinach chlo- roplasts. ATP synthesis was inhibited by 1, 2, 4 and 5 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The I50 values for this activity were 83.5 and 59.0 lM for 1 and 2, respectively; 4 and 5 had the same value 50.5 lM and 3 was almost inactive and it was not further studied (Fig. 2). 3.2. Effect of the natural furoquinoline alkaloids on chloroplast electron transport rate The light-dependent photophosphorylation is coupled to elec- tron transport rate and can be inhibited by different ways: by blocking the electron transport, by direct inhibition of the H+-ATP- ase, or by uncoupling the ATP synthesis process from the electron transport [24]. To elucidate the mechanism of action of the furo- quinoline alkaloids on photosynthesis, their effects on non- cyclic electron transport (basal, phosphorylating, and uncoupled) from water to MV were investigated. 38 T.A.M. Veiga et al. / Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 120 (2013) 36–43 Furoquinoline alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited basal, phosphor- ylating, and uncoupled electron transport as their concentrations increased up to 200 lM. The I50 values for uncoupled electron transport rate were 21.0, 18.6, 23.4 and 22.8 lM, respectively (Table 2). Compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited the electron ﬂow (in basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled conditions) and ATP syn- thesis; therefore they act as Hill reaction inhibitors. Other natural products that act as Hill reaction inhibitors are the biﬂavonoid iso- lated from Seleginella lepydophylla, robustaﬂavone [25] or the fur- anoditerpene canophyllol isolated from Celastrus vulcanicola) [16]. 3.3. Localization of furoquinoline alkaloids interaction sites on the light reaction of photosystem PS II and photosystem PS I and partial reactions To localize the inhibition site of the alkaloids on the thylakoid electron transport chain, their effects on PS II, PS I and photosys- tems partial reactions were tested using artiﬁcial electron donors and acceptors, as well as appropriate inhibitors [21]. Table 3 shows that 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited the uncoupled PS II electron ﬂow from water to DCBQ; 1 inhibited PS II 100% at a concentration of 300 lM, however, alkaloids 2, 4 and 5 inhibited partially this activity (81%, 67% and 89%, respectively) at the same concentration (300 lM); therefore, 1 was the most active compound inhibiting the PS II electron transport. To further localize the inhibition site of the furoquinolines on the PS II electron transport chain, their effects were measured on the electron ﬂow from water to SiMo (SiMo ac- cepts electrons from pheophytin, so in this way the electron ﬂow measurements are from the water splitting enzyme to pheophy- tin). The results indicate that1, 2, 4 and 5 did not affect this partial reaction, since the rate of treated thylakoids were similar to the control (data not shown), therefore, all active furoquinoline alka- loids inhibited the electron transport chain beyond the pheophytin site [20]. The polarographic measurements suggest that 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited electron transport between QA and QB of PS II, at the D1 protein by displacing QB, similar to how DCMU herbicide acts. The mechanism action of 1, 2, 4 and 5 is similar to other natural prod- ucts like trachyloban-19-oic acid [26], ﬂindersine [4]. Uncoupled PS I electron transport rate was measured by polar- ography from reduced DCPIP to MV by using increasing concentra- tions of the alkaloids tested, in order to ﬁnd if they affect this photosystem. The results of these studies showed that the rate for control and treated samples were similar, therefore the furo- quinoline alkaloids do not interact with PS I electron transport chain (data not shown). 3.4. Measurements of the Chl a ﬂuorescence transient in thylakoids in the presence of the furoquinoline alkaloids To corroborate the polarography results about the interaction site of the furoquinoline alkaloids at PS II, ﬂuorescence of chloro- phyll a were measured on freshly lysed spinach chloroplasts incu- bated for 5 min in the dark at room temperature. Control chloroplast contained the amount of DMSO used for each treat- ment, the treated chloroplasts contained various concentrations of the compounds (each concentration was measured three times); chloroplasts incubated with Tris and 10 lM DCMU were used as positive control (Fig. 3). Chlorophyll a induction curves of thylak- oids control (Fig. 3) showed an OJIP sequence similar to that previously described for plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria [27] except that phase IP was in part suppressed due to the effect of MV [28]. The chloroplasts inﬁltrated with DCMU and the control samples showed almost identical FM level (Table 4). However, the FM level of treated chloroplasts decreased respect to the control, while the Fo was not been affected by almost all the compounds tested; only 1 increased lightly the Fo level. The ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a transients were normalized, and the difference be- tween the treated and control normalized transients revealed an increase in intensity between 2 and 4 ms appearing a J-band (Fig. 4A). The ﬂuorescence rise to the J-band provides information Table 1 Derived parameters, their description and formulae using data extracted from the chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence (OJIP) transient presented in this paper.

Veiga et al. / Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 120 (2013) 36–43 39 about single turnover events of the primary reactions of the photo- chemistry, mainly QA reduction, indicating that the electron trans- port beyond QA is blocked at the QB level as DCMU does, suggesting that 1 interacts at this site and the unused energy is dissipated as heat [10]. In Fig. 4A, a small H-band was observed after 100 ms and closer to 1000 ms, this band is due to the electron acceptor MV ef- fect [28]. In Fig. 4B, a K-band is observed in chloroplasts treated with Tris 0.8 M. Even though a small K-band is also observable in chloroplasts treated with DCMU, this band can be to the solvent ef- fect of the ethanol where the DCMU was dissolved [28], however, the furoquinoline alkaloids were dissolved in DMSO as solvent and it have not any effect on the ﬂuorescence induction curve. Furthermore, the Fm value in the presence of DCMU plus MV is similar to the control sample (Table 4). In chloroplasts treated with furoquinolines alkaloids plus MV decreased Fm and the parameters derived from the JIP test (see Table 1) had similar behavior with DCMU treatment (Fig. 5), with the parameter dR0 exception, [it reﬂects the efﬁciency with which an electron can move from the reduced electron acceptors coming of the intersystem to the PS I (reducing site)] [29]; this parameter was slightly increased by the furoquinoline treatments (with DCMU treatment it drastically diminished). Values like REo/CS, REo/RC and uRo decreased with all treatments, being more drastic for DCMU. These results suggest that the furoquinoline alkaloids inhibited the electrons transport chain in two sites, one at donor and the other on the acceptor side in PS II (Fig. 5). The effect of furoquinoline alkaloids site at the donor side was detected only by the technique of ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a of PS II, and not by polarography technique [10]. 3.5. Measurements of the Chl a ﬂuorescence transient in leaf discs To know if the alkaloids can reach their targets on the photo- synthesis electron transport chain, ﬂuorescence of chlorophyll a induction curves were measured in discs obtained from fresh spinach leaves. In Fig. 6A the OJIP sequences for control and discs treated with the most active furoquinoline 1 (in this case MV was omitted from the medium) showed a rise in the J peak. In discs treated with 1, 2, and 5 at concentration of 400 lM, the differences between normalized curves and control showed a J-band (Fig. 6B). Furthermore 4 did not show any effect on the discs ﬂuorescence (data not shown). J-band for 1 was bigger than for 2 and 5 (Fig. 6B). Also 1 and 2 showed a small K-band while compound 5 lacks this band (Fig. 6C). When the transients were normalized between FM and F5, a band in the IP region ap- peared (30 ms to about 300 ms) for compounds 2 and 5 (Fig. 6D).

Veiga et al. / Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 120 (2013) 36–43 transients obtained with 1 (Fig. 7), parameters as dRo and uRo in- creased up to 60%, indicating that the efﬁciency with which an electron can move from the reduced intersystem of electron acceptors to the PS I end acceptors increased. In addition, the quantum yield for the reduction of PSI end acceptors per photon absorbed also increased. These results suggest that end acceptors of PS I cannot be reduced because the electrons from PS II are not available. The parameters for 2 and 5 are similar to the con- trol (Fig. 7) indicating that these compounds do not reach com- pletely their target.

In vivo assays In order to conﬁrm if 1 can penetrate the intact whole leaf and affect the plants in vivo, this compound was sprayed on the leaves of L. perenne and P. ixocarpa plants after 15 days of growth in the green house. Studies of chlorophyll a Fluorescence were performed on the plants after 24, 48 and 72 h of being sprayed with 1 at 150 and 300 lM. The results showed non-signiﬁcant inhibiting growth effect. These results suggest that 1 does not overcome the natural barriers provided by the plants, since the chlorophyll a and dry bio- mass of these plants were not affected by 1 (data not shown). 4. Conclusions The results indicated that furoquinoline alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 inhibited ATP synthesis and electron transport in spinach chloro- plasts while 3 was inactive. The inhibition site of alkaloids 1, 2, 4 and 5 was located at the acceptor side of PS II by polarographic technique. When these results were corroborated by chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence of PS II data; we found that the donor side of PSII is inhibited by these furoquinoline alkaloids. Chlorophyll a ﬂuores- cence measurements on leaf discs treated with furoquinoline alka- loids showed changes in the induction curve of ﬂuorescence only with 1, transforming the OJIP trace at OJ step, showing a J band which indicates that only 1 can reach its inhibition target. However when 1 was sprayed on intact whole leaves, this compound could not penetrate the leaves plant natural barriers. Furthermore, 1 with two methoxy groups has the lowest molar volume unlike com- pounds 2, 4 and 5 with 3 methoxy groups and therefore larger mo- lar volumes which make more difﬁcult their translocation in the leaves. Also alkaloid 3 has a lower molar volume, but it has a LogP value of 2.70, similar to compounds 4 and 5. However, 1 has a high- er LogP value of 3.20 suggesting that this compound fulﬁlls the speciﬁc structure requirements for inhibiting PSII electron trans- port chain in leaf discs that the other furoquinoline alkaloids stud- ied lack these characteristics.
