Abstract-The  trunk wood of Emmotum &ens (Benth.) Miers (Icacinaceae) contains the aromatic sesquiter-  penes 2-hydroxy-3-(2’-hydroxyisopropy1)-8-methoxymethy1-5-methy1-l-oxo-l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene  (em-  motin-A), 2-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethy1-3-(2’-hydroxyisopropy1)-8-m~thoxyme~hyi-l-oxo-l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaph-  thalene (emmotin-B),  1,2-dihydroxy-8-formyl-3-isopropyl-5-methylnaphthalene  (emmotin-C)  and 8-carboxy-  1,2-dihydroxy-3-(2’-hydroxyisopropyl)-5-methylnaphthalene  y-lactone (emmotin-D).  A  SPECIMEN of Emmotum  nitens  (Benth.) Miers, an arboreous  Icacinaceae  species  growing in the vicinity of Diamantina  in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, was  collected and identified by the botanist A. Pereira Duarte. A chemical investigation  of  the trunk wood  has now revealed  the presence  of sitosterol  and four crystalline  compounds, designated emmotin-A, -B, -C, and -D.  Elemental analysis and MS MW determination  of emmotin-A  indicated its formula  to be C,,Hz20,.  Its UV and IR spectra revealed the presence of an aryl ketone moiety  and its PMR spectrum exhibited signals characteristic  of two ortho hydrogens, aromatic  methyl and methoxymethyl  groups, a 2-hydroxyisopropyl  function and a 3-carbon unit  defined in part structure 1. The relative substituent positions in the latter were determined  from the shift and coupling behavior  of its 4 hydrogens.  The oxymethine  hydrogen  (4.43 ppm) was represented  by a doublet  of 12.5 Hz, the other methine hydrogen  (2.21 ppm) by a double  1 : 2 : 1 triplet of 12.5, 12.5 and 4.5 Hz and the methylene  hydrogens (2.53, 3.02 ppm) by two quartets of 16.5 and 12.5 Hz and of 16.5 and 4.5 Hz,  respectively. The chemical shifts of the hydrogens of the 3-carbon system indicated the  terminal carbons to be attached to the carbonyl group and aromatic  ring and hence  the central carbon to the hydroxyisopropyl  group. The presence of an a-ketol function  in emmotin-A, indicated by the deacetoxylation  of the diacetate 2b and formation  of  * Part I in the projected  series “The Chemistry  of Brazilian Icacinaceae”,  taken from part of the  M. S. Thesis submitted by M. de L. M. F. to the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, and Part XXI in  the series “13C NMR Spectroscopy of Naturally Occurring Substances”.  PHYTO  13/7--L  1199  3 on reduction  with zinc,’  showed  that  the attachment  of the j-carbon  unit  to the  remainder  of the ring system could only be in the form depicted  in 2a.

The side chain  alcohol  is tertiary  and the natural  product  underwent  dehydration  on treatment  with phosphorous  oxychloride  in pyridine.  Although  the resultant  mixture  could not be separated.  its PMR spectrum  revealed  it to  consist  of olefins  4 and 5 by the methyl  singlets  (1.64. I.73 ppm) of the isopropylidene  unit of the former  and  the methyl  singlet  (1.57 ppm) and olefinic  methylene  multiplet  (4.9-5.2  ppm)  of the isopropenyl  group  of the latter.  The methoxymethyl  group  was  shown  to be located  orrho to the carbonyl  function  and  its oxymethylenc  hydrogens  deshielded  by the latter. since sodium  borohydride  reduction  of emmotin-A  yielded a trio1  whose PMR spectrum  revealed  the oxymethylenc  hydrogen  signal 0.9 ppm upfield of its  earlier  position.  The combined  PMR  data  for emmotin-A  and  its derivatives  showed  the natural  product  to possess structure  2a or 6a. While 2a was preferred  on biogenetic  grounds.  its final proof depended  on its ‘.‘C NM R analysis  (ritlc ir~/i.tr).  (4)  (5)  (6~11 R = Me; Y =H  (6b)  R = Me; Y =OH  (6~)  R=  H;  Y=OMe  The MS MW determination  of emmotin-B  showed it to be oxyemmotin-A,  C,(,H2205.  The PMR spectrum  of emmotin-B  resembled  closely that of emmotin-A,  differing  mainly  by the replacement  of the aromatic  methyl  singlet  (2.32 ppm)  of the latter  by an  oxymethylene  singlet (4.67 ppm). The presence  of an extra hydroxy  group was confirmed  by the formation  of a triacetate  (2d) on acetylation  of emmotin-B.  The PMR spectrum  of the acetate  exhibited  the new oxymethylene  signal at expectedly  lower field (A(S 0.45).  These  facts support  structure  2c. 2c with methoxymethyl  and  hydroxymethyl  groups  interchanged,  6b or 6c for emmotin-B.  The natural  abundance  ‘-‘C NMR  spectra  of emmotin-A  and  emmotin-B  yielded  further  insight  into the structures  of the two sesquiterpenes.  Inspection  of the proton-  decoupled  and the single-frequency,  off-resonance  decoupled  spectra  of the former  in  ’ Roct \t tt II. K. S. and (;\I  I ,\<;ttrzi<. 1‘. I-. (lwi)  .J. 1~11. ( /i<,,rt soc  77. 136’.  Aromatic  sesquiterpenoids  from emm~tun~ nirens  1201  CDCl,  revealed  one carbonyl,  one quaternary  sp3 carbon  and four quaternary  aromatic  carbon  signals, two non-aromatic  an’d two aromatic  methine  resonances,  two methylene  and  four methyl  signals,  while a similar  inspection  of the spectra  of emmotin-B  in CDCI,  showed  the replacement  of a methyl  resonance  by a methylene  signal.  The assignment  of the chemical  shifts of all non-aromatic  carbons,  indicated  on formulas  7 and 8 for  emmotin-A  and emmotin-B,  respectively,  was based on chemical  shift theory,2  while that  for the aromatic  carbon  shifts was founded  on the following  arguments.  The difference  of the methine  carbon  shifts is mainly  due to the difference  of the disposition  of the  carbons  toward  the carbonyl  group,  the p-carbon  being deshielded  strongly.2  The latter  as well as the quaternary  centers under the aromatic  methyl group and its ortho neighbour  are the only aromatic  carbons  differing  in chemical  shift in the two compounds,  hence  revealing  the presence  of the extra oxygen  in their vicinity  in emmotin-B.  The remaining  two quaternary  carbon  shifts are assigned  on the basis  of expected  similarity  of the  6 values of the two carbons  ortho to the acylated  carbon  site.  (71  (8)  The fact that only  the shifts of the aromatic  carbons  in the neighbourhood  of the  aromatic  methyl  group  of emmotin-A  are changed  in emmotin-B  proves  that the methyl  function  of the former and the hydroxymethyl  group of the latter occupy the same position  in the aromatic  ring of the two substances.  Furthermore,  the shielding  of the benzylic  methylene  group  in the hydroaromatic  ring  on introduction  of an oxygen  onto  the  aromatic  methyl  group  shows the ortho relationship  between  the two groups,  excludes  structures  6 for the emmotins  and limits emmotin-A  to structure  2a. Finally,  the nearly  identical  shifts of the methoxymethyl  carbons  and their aromatic  neighbours  in the two  emmotins  excludes  the possibility  of the methoxymethyl  and hydroxymethyl  units  being  interchanged  in emmotin-B  and limits the latter to structure  2c.  The emmotins  A and B coexist  in the plant  with structurally  related,  minor,  naph-  thalenes.  The PMR  spectrum  of one of the latter,  emmotin-C  (C,5H,,03),  exhibited  signals  characteristic  of three aromatic  hydrogens,  two hydroxy  groups  and one each of  aldehyde,  methyl  and  isopropyl  functions,  whose  combination  in light  of a probable  biogenetic  relationship  of emmotin-C  with emmotin-A  suggested  structure  9 for the minor  product.  The aldehyde  function  (9.66 ppm singlet)  was hydrogen-bonded  to a hydroxyl  group  (12.3 ppm, s) and deshielded  an ortho hydrogen  (7.79 ppm)  which  was coupled  strongly  (8 Hz) to another  hydrogen  (7.24 ppm) whose  PMR signal  broadness  revealed  weak, long-range  coupling  with the neighbouring  methyl  group  (hs. 2.77 ppm).  These  facts are in agreement  with structure  9 for emmotin-C.  z STO-THI;HS. J. B. (1972) l.‘C NMR  Spc~c’tro.my~. Academic  Press. New York:  LEVY. G. C. and NEISON. G. L.

The PMR spectra of emmotin-D  and its derivatives  revealed  the  plant  product  to contain  two ortl~o hydrogens  and  another  aromatic  hydrogen,  an  aromatic  methyl  group,  two hydroxy  functions  and  two methyl  groups.  which.  while  deshielded,  were reminiscent  of those  of the 2-hydroxyisopropyl  unit  of emmotins  A  and  R.
