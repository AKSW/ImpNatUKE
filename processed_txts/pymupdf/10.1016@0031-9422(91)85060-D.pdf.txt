Abstract-The  leaves of Rapanea  umbellota  yielded three terpeno-p-hydroxybenzoic  acid derivatives which appear to  be novel. These compounds  were identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis as 3-geranyl-4-hydroxy-5-(3”,3”-  dimethylallyl)-benzoic  acid; 5-carboxy-7-(3”,3”-dimethylallyl)-2-(:l’-hydroxy-l’,5’-dimethylhex-4’-enyl)-2,3-dihydro-  benzofuran  and 6-carboxy-8-(3”,3”-dimethylallyl)-3a-hydroxy-2a-methyl-2-(4’-methylpent-3’-enyl)-3,4-dihydroben-  zopyran.  The fruits of Rapanea  umbellata  (Mart.) Mez. have been  shown  to contain  3,6-dihydroxy-2-undecyl-p-benzo-  quinone, embehn [l]. An investigation  of the leaves of  R. umbellata,  a Brazilian shrub or small tree, has led to  the isolation of three additional compounds which were  purified as their methyl esters (l-3) and which appear to  be novel.  RESULTS AND DISCLSSION  The dichloromethane  extract of the leaves yielded, on  chromatography  over silica gel, 3-geranyl-5-prenyl-p-hy-  droxybenzoic acid (1) and two of its derivates (2,3). The  three acids were methylated with diazomethane  prior to  analysis.  The most apolar compound (l), C23H3203 (MS), gave  rise to an IR spectrum which indicated the presence of  an arylcarbomethoxy  (1720 cm- ‘) and a hydroxy group  (335Ocn-‘).  ‘HNMR  spectroscopy (Table 1) showed  the aromatic  ring to be 1,3,4,5_tetrasubstituted,  with  CO,Me (63.85) and hydroxyl pore with respect to each  other. The unsubstituted  C-2 and C-6 (2H, brs,  87.69)  must be vicinal to CO,Me. The ‘H NMR spectrum also  showed the presence of y,y-dimethylallyl  and geranyl  systems [2, 33 (6 1.77-1.62, 5 vinyl methyls, 6 5.34, 3 ole-  finic protons and 63.29, 2 arylallyl substituted  methyl-  enes). The mass spectrum showed peaks which indicated  CsH, (m/z 339 and 231, Scheme 1) and C,,H,,  (m/z 231  and 271, Scheme 1) substituents,  both adjacent to the  phenolic  hydroxyl  [4]. Acetylation  of 1 with acetic  anhydride in pyridine gave an acetate which confirmed  the presence of a phenolic group. The 13C NMR chemical  shifts for the y,r-dimethylallyl  and geranyl groups agreed  closely with published  data for these groups in 3,4-  dihydroxy-5-(2-isopentenyl)-benzoic  acid (4) [2] and 6-  geranyl-7-hydroxy-coumarin  (5) [5], respectively. The  *Based on part of the M.S. thesis presented by A.H.J. to  Universidade Federal de SBo Carlos (1990).  new natural product is therefore 3-geranyl-4-hydroxy-5-  (3”,3’‘-dimethylallyl)-benzoic  acid.  Compound 2, C,,H,,O,,  had IR absorptions  similar  to 1. The ‘H NMR spectrum (Table l), in addition to  signals typical of a prenylbenzoic  acid methyl ester,  revealed two benzylic protons (63.22 and 3.20 H-3a, J  = 8.5 Hz; H-3b, J = 9.4 Hz) which coupled with one oxy-  methine proton (64.69, dd, H-2, J=9.4, 8.5 Hz), charac-  teristic of a 2,3-dihydro-benzofurane  derivative  [6, 73.  Methyl resonances at 6 1.67, 1.60 and 1.27, as well as  signals for an olefinic proton (65.10) and a hydroxyl  (62.59) suggested the presence of a 1’-hydroxy-1’,5’-  dimethylhex-4’-enyl  side chain attached to the dihydro-  furan ring on C-2. This was supported  by the mass  spectrum which showed fragments at m/z 245 and 127  (Scheme 1) due to fission of the side chain between C-2  and C-l’. The identification  of the nucleus as a dihydro-  benzofuran received further support from the 13C NMR  spectrum (Table 2) which showed close agreement with  published data for this group in 6 [6]. Compound  2  was resistant  to (Ac,O-pyridine).  The mass, ‘H and  ’ 3C NMR spectra of the tetrahydroderivative  indicated  the absence of aliphatic double bonds. The structure of  the new natural product is therefore 5-carboxy-7-(3”,3”-  dimethylallyl)-2-(l’-hydroxy-l’,5’-dimethy~hex-4’-enyl)-  2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.  The third compound  (3) also showed the spectral  characteristics of a prenylbenzoic acid methyl ester. How-  ever, the mass spectrum gave significant fragments for  m/z 289 and 233 (Scheme 1) requiring the presence of an  hydroxyl group in the dihydropyran  substituent.  The  ‘%J NMR spectrum (Table 2) revealed resonances for C-2  to C-4 in close agreement with the resonances for the  corresponding  carbons  in  a linear  3-hydroxy-2,2-  dimethyldihydropyranocoumarin  (7) [S]. In addition,  two olefinic carbon signals at 6 132.20 and 123.75 con-  firmed the presence of the 4’-methylpent-3’-enyl  side  chain at C-2 of the dihydropyran  structure. Mass spectral  fission between C-2 and C-l’ afforded the ion m/z 289. In  the 1 H NMR spectrum (Table 1). 3 showed the carbinolic  proton and methoxy signals at ca 63.84. The secondary  nature of the hydroxyl function was apparent from the  2019  2020  A. H.

PAY  30:6-S  2022  A. H. JANUARIO et al.  group. A shift of the Me-2 signal (A6 0.72) suggested  for  hydroxyl  and Me-2 a cis relationship.  Oxidation  of 3b  with PCC and subsequent  reduction  with sodium boro-  hydride  gave the two possible  epimers  (6 1.26, 2%-Me;  S 1.28, 2,Y-Me). Addition  of Eu(fod),  caused  a shift  (A6 0.58) of the Me-2 signal at 6 1.26. The structure  of the  new natural product  was thus established  as 6-carboxy-8-  (3”,3”-dimethylallyl)-3~-hydroxy-2a-methyl-2-(4’-meth-  ylpent-3’-enyl)-3.4-dihydrobenzopyran.  Previous  studies  of the Myrsinaceae  have led to the  isolation  of a number  of 3,6-dihydroxy-2-alkylbenzo-  quinones  [8].  3-Geranylated-S-prenylated-p-hydroxy-  benzoic  acid derivatives,  which are very rare in nature,  have been found in one of the Myrsinaceae  species. Other  m-y,y-dimethylallylbenzoic  acid  derivatives  have  been  recorded  in the Compositae  [Z, 6, 73. However,  3-  geranylated-5-prenylated-p-hydroxybenzoic  acid deriv-  atives  represent  a novel  group  of terpeno-p-hydro-  xybenzoic  acids.
