Introduction Diketopiperazines (DKPs) are well known secondary metabo- lites produced by fungi (Laws and Mantle, 1985) that display sev- eral biological activities, such as antibiotic, antitumoral and immunosuppressant properties (Ameur et al., 2004), as well a wide range of biological effects in cell cycle progression (Cui et al., 1996). Condensation of two or three amino acid precursors is involved in the DKP biosynthetic pathway (Kozlovsky et al., 2000; Laws and Mantle, 1985), with the later also being known as cyclic dipeptides when derived from condensation of two amino acids. Secondary metabolites from fungi that incorporate more than one amino acid are typically synthesized via non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) (Mootz and Marahiel, 1997). A number of DKP derivatives feature either thiomethyl groups or disulphide bridges (Müllbach- er et al., 1986), and those with an internal disulphide bridge are known as epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs) which are typically toxic metabolites from fungi (Gardiner et al., 2005). The ﬁrst and best-known ETP is gliotoxin, isolated from Gliocladium ﬁmbriatum (Weindling, 1941; Weindling and Emerson, 1936), which is in- volved in animal mycoses and appears to be a factor contributing to virulence associated with invasive aspergillosis in immunocom- promised patients (Gardiner et al., 2005). Labelling experiments demonstrated that amino acids are precursors of ETPs (Gardiner et al., 2005), although how sulphur atoms are introduced into ETPs is poorly understood. While it has been demonstrated that methi- onine, cysteine and sodium sulphate can act as sources of sulphur (Kirby et al., 1980), the mechanisms by which sulphur atoms are introduced are still unknown (Gardiner et al., 2005). Endophytes have been identiﬁed as rich and relatively un- tapped sources of novel bioactive secondary metabolites (Bashyal et al., 2005; Clardy and Walsh, 2004; Gunatilaka, 2006; Strobel et al., 2004). Endophytic fungi can be detected within the tissues of apparently healthy plant hosts (Schulz and Boyle, 2005) and they have been found in almost all plants investigated to date (Ar- nold et al., 2000). Several novel bioactive metabolites have recently been isolated from these microorganisms (Gallo et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2008; Pupo et al., 2006; Borges et al., 2009). Interestingly, some endophytic fungi have been reported to produce bioactive compounds previously isolated from their host plants, including the therapeutic anticancer drugs taxol (Stierle et al., 1993, 1995; Strobel et al., 1996), vincristine (Yang et al., 2004), podophyllotoxin (Eyberger et al., 2006; Puri et al., 2006), camptothecin (Puri et al., 2005) and the bioactive compound hypericin (Kusari et al., 2008). 0031-9422/$ - see front matter � 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Phytochemistry 71 (2010) 1423–1429 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Phytochemistry journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/phytochem As part of our ongoing search for novel and bioactive com- pounds from endophytes found in association with Asteraceae spe- cies, we have focused studies on endophytic fungi strains that showed antitumoral and antimicrobial activities (Borges and Pupo, 2006; Gallo et al., 2008; Guimarães et al., 2008; Momesso et al., 2008). These screening efforts have shown the fungal strains Fusar- ium spp., an endophyte in Viguiera arenaria, and Colletotrichum glo- eosporioides, an endophyte in Viguiera robusta, as good targets to be pursued due to their moderate antimicrobial activity against Can- dida albicans and antitumor activity against JURKAT leukemia cell lines (Guimarães et al., 2008). We have also successfully applied endophytic fungi to the biotransformation of drugs (Borges et al., 2007, 2008) and natural products (Verza et al., 2009). Penicillium crustosum, an endophyte in V. robusta, catalyzed stereoselective S-oxidation of the neuroleptic drug thioridazine and has been stud- ied in the biotransformation of other bioactive natural products (unpublished data). These results encouraged us to investigate the secondary metabolites of the endophytic fungal strains Fusar- ium sp., C. gloeosporioides and P. crustosum. 2. Results and discussion Compounds 1 and 2 were isolated from the endophyte C. gloeo- sporioides, whereas compounds 3 and 4 were isolated from the cul- ture of Fusarium sp. DKPs 5–7 were obtained from P. crustosum (Fig. 1). The 1H, 13C NMR and MS spectroscopic data of 1 coincide with previously reported data for the compound bisdethiobis(methyl- thio)gliotoxin, a secondary metabolite biosynthesized by the fun- gus Gliocladium deliquescens (Kirby et al., 1980). The absolute stereochemistry of 1 was investigated using electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and this allowed the determination of the abso- lute conﬁgurations of the asymmetric centers as 3(R), 6(R), 12(S) and 13(S) by comparison with previously reported data for com- pound 1 (Li et al., 2006). This compound is produced by irreversible disulphide bridge reduction and S-methylation of gliotoxin (Kirby et al., 1980), a well known mycotoxin. Compound 1 acts as a spe- ciﬁc inhibitor of the platelet activating factor (IC50 = 8.4 lM) and showed antibacterial activity against both methicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Okamoto et al., 1986; Li et al., 2006). The molecular formula of compound 2 was established by HRE- SIMS as C14H16N2NaO4S (see Section 4). 1H, COSY, HMQC and HMBC NMR spectroscopic analyses and comparison with the data of compound 1 suggested that compound 2 is a new DKP deriva- tive. The IR spectrum of compound 2 showed characteristic absorp- tion bands of OH (broad, 3272 cm�1), amide carbonyls (1668 and 1638 cm�1) and one absorption band assigned to mN–H (1599 cm�1). The main 1H NMR spectroscopic differences between 1 and 2 are that the later has three aromatic hydrogens and only one methyl signal for the thiomethyl group. The presence of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted phenyl ring was evident from the 1H signals at d 6.78 (br d, J 7.7 Hz, H-11), d 6.83 (br d, J 7.7 Hz, H-9) and d 7.10 (t, J 7.7 Hz, H-10), which were coupled in the COSY spectrum. The methyl thiomethyl group at d 2.22 (s, 3H) showed long-range coupling with C-3 (d 73.7) in the HMBC spectrum. Two hydrogens of an AX spin system were observed at d 4.51 (d, J 11.9 Hz, H-14) and d 3.97 (d, J 11.9 Hz, H-14) and are attached to the oxygen substituted methylene carbon at d 63.4, and this being in agree- ment with a serine unit. The 1H NMR spectrum also showed two singlets at d 3.19 (–NCH3) and d 8.54 (–OH), whereas the methyl group at d 3.19 had correlations to the carbons at d 170.0 (C-5) and d 73.7 (C-3), allowing us to locate the methyl group at N-4. Two methylene hydrogens were observed at d 3.35 (m, 2H) coupled to a hydrogen at d 5.09 (dd, J 9.1; 10.3 Hz; H-6) in the COSY spec- trum. Therefore, analysis of the NMR spectroscopic data suggested a DKP structure for 2 closely resembling 1. Due to the limited amount of the compound isolated, the carbon chemical shifts were obtained from the HMQC and HMBC experiments. Although seven carbons are missing, the HRESIMS and 1H NMR data support the proposed structure. The known compound dehydrodethiogliotox- in, lacking both thiomethyl groups, is the structure most similar to compound 2 (Bell et al., 1958). Compound 2 is a new DKP deriv- ative and is named colletopiperazine. The molecular formula of compound 3 was established as C17H22N2O4 (see Section 4). The 1H NMR spectrum had two dou- blets belonging to an AA0XX0 spin system at d 6.86 (d, J 8.7 Hz, H- 10/100) and d 7.08 (d, J 8.7 Hz, H-9/90), suggesting a para-disubsti- tuted aromatic ring in the structure. The HMQC data showed that these hydrogens are attached to carbons at d 115.2 (C-10/100) and d 131.7 (C-9/90), respectively. The HMBC correlation between the hydrogens at d 7.08 (H-9/90) and the carbon at d 159.0 (C- 11), and also the aromatic hydrogens shielded chemical shifts, sug- gested a group containing oxygen at C-11. A pair of methylene hydrogens was observed as two doublets at d 3.20 (d, J 13.6 Hz, H-7b) and d 3.00 (d, J 13.6 Hz, H-7a) and HMQC showed their attachment to a carbon at d 48.4 (C-7). Both methylene hydrogens are correlated to the aromatic carbons at d 131.7 (C-9/90) in the HMBC spectrum. The hydrogen at d 3.00 (H-7a) also showed long-range correlations to carbons at d 82.6 (C-6) and d 167.3 (C- 5). These data suggest that methylene hydrogens H-7a and H-7b are close to the aromatic ring, to the quaternary carbon at d 82.6 and to the amide carbonyl carbon at d 167.3 of the diketopipera- zine ring, indicating the presence of a tyrosine moiety in the struc- ture. Carbon 6 was observed as a quaternary carbon in the HMQC and presented a deshielded chemical shift compared to the sulphur N H N O O OH O N H HN O O O S S N O O S S N O O S S N N O O S N O S HO HO S N N O N O N O N O O S HO HO 3 4 5 1 3 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 9' 10' 17 18 5 4 5 6 1 2 3 17 18 19 20 6 17 18 19 20 7 17 18 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 13 14 15 17 16 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 13 14 15 16 2 O Fig. 1. Diketopiperazines produced by the endophytic fungi Colletotrichum gloeo- sporioides (1–2) Fusarium spp. (3–4) and Penicillium crustosum (5–7). 1424 D.O. Guimarães et al. / Phytochemistry 71 (2010) 1423–1429 substituted carbons in compounds 1 and 2, suggesting an hydroxyl group attachment at this position. Two hydrogens at d 4.50 (d, J 6.8 Hz, H-12) were coupled to a vinyl hydrogen at d 5.40 (br t, J 6.8 Hz, H-13), which was observed as a broad triplet suggesting a long-range coupling with methyl hydrogens observed at d 1.80 (br s, H-15) and d 1.74 (br s, H-16). Methyl hydrogens gave long- range correlations with both vinyl carbons at d 119.7 (C-13) and d 138.9 (C-14), suggesting a prenyl group attached to a tyrosine moiety. An alanine unit linked to the O-prenyltyrosine moiety was evident from the 1H NMR spectrum by the presence of an AX spin system at d 2.75 (d, J 17.6 Hz, 1H) and d 3.50 (d, J 17.6 Hz, 1H). Finally, the HMBC spectrum showed correlations among methyl group at d 2.84 (s, H-17) and carbons at d 52.1 (C- 3) and d 167.3 (C-5), allowing the location of one methyl group to N-4. Compound 3, fusaperazine C, was found to be a new O- prenyltyrosine DKP derivative. The molecular formula of compound 4 was established as C18H24N2O3S2 according to MS and NMR spectroscopic data. The NMR data showed similarities with the previously described DKP derivative 3. The O-prenyltyrosine moiety was evident from both 1H and 13C NMR data, and conﬁrmed by analysis of the HMBC spec- trum. The HMQC spectrum showed signals at d 1.14 (s, 3H, H-17) and d 2.14 (s, 3H, H-18), attached to carbons at d 9.4 and d 13.0, respectively, which indicated the presence of two thiomethyl groups. The NMR and optical rotation data obtained were com- pared with previously described data and allowed us to establish compound 4 as a DKP derivative previously isolated from Tolypoc- ladium sp. (Chu et al., 1993) and Fusarium chlamydosporum (Usami et al., 2002). However our 1H NMR spectroscopic data for both thiomethyl groups were inverted when compared to the ﬁrst pub- lished data (Chu et al., 1993) and in agreement with later published data (Usami et al., 2002). The more shielded chemical shifts for both hydrogens and carbon of thiomethyl group at C-3 (dH 1.14, dC 9.4), compared to thiomethylgroup at C-6 (dH 2.14, dC 13.0), could be explained by a spatial proximity to the phenyl ring. NOE irradiation of H-17 (s; d 1.14) showed dipolar couplings with the aromatic hydrogens H-10 (d; d 6.80) and H-9 (d; d 7.16), con- ﬁrming this close spatial relationship. This proximity would only be possible if the thiomethyl at C-3 and O-prenyltyrosine groups are in a cis conﬁguration. In addition, compound 4 should adopt a folded conformation in order to account for the observed NOEs. Such a folded conformation has been reported for DKPs and other peptides, and it has been related with the biological activities of many compounds (Umezawa et al., 1999). The stability of 4 in this folded conformation might be explained by a CH/p interaction be- tween the electrons of the aromatic ring and the polarized hydro- gens of the thiomethyl group, similar to the stabilization of many proteins and peptides (Umezawa et al., 1999). This interaction has been conﬁrmed by molecular modeling studies (see discussion below). Compound 4 displayed weak inhibitory activity in a PAF assay in contrast with the cis isomer which was found to be inac- tive (Chu et al., 1993) indicating that the spatial position of the thiomethyl group is important for this activity. The 1H NMR spectroscopic data of compounds 5 and 6 were similar to those observed for 4, showing signals of an O-prenylty- rosine group and of two thiomethyl groups. The main difference was the presence of two additional –NCH3 groups for both com- pounds. The molecular formula of compounds 5 and 6 were estab- lished as C20H28N2O3S2 by MS. Structures were unequivocally established based on optical rotation, 1H, 13C NMR, NOE, HMQC and HMBC data, which are in agreement with previously published data for compounds 5 and 6 (Wang et al., 1998; Kawahara et al., 1987; Usami et al., 2002). The molecular formula of compound 7 was established as C19H24N2O3S by HRESIMS. The structure of 7 was assigned by anal- ysis of its 1H, 13C, HMQC and HMBC NMR spectra. The 1H NMR spectrum showed similarities with the 1H NMR spectra of com- pounds 3–6. The 1H NMR spectrum of 7 showed the same signals observed for the O-prenyltyrosyne previously described for com- pound 3. The 13C NMR spectrum showed six quaternary carbons at d 138.2; d 159.3; d 125.6; d 130.0; d 159.2; d 163.2. The quater- nary carbon chemical shifts are similar to those observed for com- pounds 5 and 6, except for the carbon at d 130.0, suggesting an analogue compound for 7 when compared with 5 and 6. The main differences between 5–6 and 7 were at the DKP moiety. Compound 7 showed a vinyl carbon at d 130.0 instead of one thiomethyl group. Attempts to unequivocally establish the geometry of the D6,7 double bound through NOE irradiation did not result in reli- able results. No NOEs were observed after irradiation of both H-7 and H-18 signals. However, C-7 and H-7 chemical shifts observed for 7 are in agreement with a previously related 6Z DKP derivative (Bryans et al., 1996). In order to establish the absolute conﬁgura- tion of 7 and also to get some insight regarding the D6,7 conﬁgura- tion, experimental ECD were performed and the data obtained were compared with theoretical calculations for the four possible stereoisomers (3R,6E; 3S,6E; 3R,6Z; 3S,6Z) (see Supplementary information). The experimental ECD spectrum shows a positive Cotton effect at 311 nm ([h]311 +1061) and a negative Cotton effect at 252 nm ([h]252 �532). Theoretical calculations for the ECD were carried out in the solvent medium by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the PBE1PBE hybrid functional level and 6-31 + G* basis set. Although a very nice agreement is lacking between the experimental and theoretical ECD, it is still possible to assign the data to the 3R,6Z-isomer. The same approach was also carried out for compounds 2 and 3; however, the obtained data did not allow us to establish the absolute conﬁguration by compar- ison between theoretical and experimental ECD spectra. Interestingly, compounds 5, 6 and 7 have been isolated from the culture of P. crustosum in the presence of 10% 1-tetralone. When P. crustosum was cultured in the absence of 1-tetralone, these com- pounds were not produced. Curiously, the cultivation of P. crustosum in the presence of 10% chlorogenic acid also led to the production of compounds 5 and 6, while in the absence of chlorogenic acid they were not produced. Therefore, these DKP derivatives might be re- lated to chemical defense of the endophytic fungus. Monte Carlo algorithmic analysis (Hehre, 2003; Leach, 2001) using MMFF molecular mechanics analysis and the Spartan ‘06 software (Spartan, 2006) was successful in assigning low-energy conformers and in providing quantitative estimates of conforma- tional energy differences. Thus, two low-energy conformers, one extended and another folded, have been assigned for DKPs 4 and 6 (Fig. 2). As a second step in the simulations, both the extended and folded conformations obtained for these two compounds were fully optimized in gas phase at B3LYP/6-31G* level of calculation (Spartan, 2006). Similar procedures were carried out with DKP 5, yielding mainly the extended conformation. Regarding this com- pound, it showed an inverted conﬁguration at C-3 in comparison with both compounds 4 and 6. After optimization, short distances were assigned for the CH/p contacts in DKPs 4 and 6. Despite the simulations performed in the gas phase, a trend of intramolecular interactions could be observed as expected for DKPs (Umezawa et al., 1999). No signiﬁcant energy differences between folded and extended conformations were observed for either compound (especially DKP 4) exhibiting a closer spatial position between their aromatic and thiomethyl groups. Compounds 1, 2, 4–7 were evaluated in the in vivo antibacterial assay using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans infected with the human opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis according to a previously described protocol (Moy et al., 2006). All the com- pounds did not show signiﬁcant ability to promote the nematode survival. D.O. Guimarães et al. / Phytochemistry 71 (2010) 1423–1429 1425 3. Conclusion In conclusion, we have isolated and identiﬁed seven DKP deriv- atives from three endophytic fungi, three of which are described for the ﬁrst time. Isolated compounds showed no signiﬁcant anti- microbial activities. Five DKP derivatives exhibit one O-prenyltyro- sine group which could be considered a relatively rare peptide building block of limited distribution in nature. Phomamide, cy- clo-O-(c,c-dimethylallyl)-L-tyrosyl-L-serine, was produced by the fungus Phoma lingam and appears to be the ﬁrst reported O-pren- yltyrosine DKP derivative from a microbial source (Ferezou et al., 1980). Approximately 46 compounds possessing an O-prenyltyro- sine unit have been reported so far; however, most of them are cyclic peptides and cyclodepsipeptides. Novel N- and C-prenylated tryptophan DKP derivatives and other cyclic peptides have also been isolated from microbial sources (Schultz et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008). Therefore, our results coincide with the assertion that endophytic fungi are outstanding sources of novel chemical diversity. 4. Experimental 4.1. General experimental procedures UV spectra were obtained in methanol (MeOH) solution using a SHIMADZU PC 1520 spectrophotometer and IR spectra were mea- sured with a Nicole Protégé 460 spectrophotometer. ECD spectra were obtained in MeOH solution using a JASCO J-715 spectropolar- imeter. High-resolution ESI-MS data were obtained on an UltrO- TOF (Bruker-daltonics, Billarica, USA). Analytical and semi prepara- tive HPLC analyses were carried out on a Shimadzu (LC-6AD appa- ratus, Japan) multisolvent delivery system, Shimadzu SPD-M10Avp Photodiode Array Detector, and an Intel Celeron computer for ana- lytical system control, data collection and processing (software Class-VP). Shim-Pack CLC-ODS, 250/4.6 C-18 and VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C18 columns were applied as stationary phases. HPLC analyses were also carried out on a Merck Hitachi HPLC cou- pled with pump L-7100 Merck, refraction index detector L-7490 Merck and Borwin software. NMR experiments were recorded on BRUKER DRX-400, BRUKER DRX-500 and VARIAN INOVA- 400 MHz spectrometers with CD3OD, DMSOd6 and CDCl3 as sol- vents and TMS as internal standard. Optical rotations were mea- sured with a JASCO DIP-370 spectrometer. Column chromatographies were carried out on silica gel 60 (Merck, 0.063–0.200 mm), silica gel 60 C8 reversed phase (Merck 0.063– 0.200 mm) and silica gel for ﬂash chromatography (Sigma–Aldrich, 230–400 mesh). 4.2. Microorganisms Endophytic fungi strain codes VR7 and VR4 were isolated from V. robusta and identiﬁed as C. gloeosporioides and P. crustosum, respectively, by conventional taxonomy. Strain VR7 was identiﬁed by Fundação André Tosello, Campinas, SP, Brazil. Strain VR4 was identiﬁed by Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelculture (CBS – Fungal Biodiversity Centre), The Netherlands. Strain VA17 was isolated from V. arenaria and showed 98% identity to Fusarium spp. on the basis of its ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence (Guimarães et al., 2008). Strain VR7 showed 100% rDNA sequence identity to Glome- rella cingulata. In fact, G. cingulata is the teleomorph (sexual) stage of C. gloeosporioides. The strains were maintained on potato dex- trose agar slants, on agar plugs in sterile water and on silica gel (1–4 mm Synth, Brazil), stored at 4 �C, at our laboratory. The strains were deposited at the Laboratório de Química de Micro- organismos, FCFRP-USP, under voucher numbers VR4, VR7 and VA17. (VA17 and VR7 sequences available in Supplementary information). 4.3. Culturing of microorganisms and isolation of diketopiperazines C. gloeosporioides and Fusarium spp. were cultured using a two- step fermentation process. First, suspension of the mycelium was aseptically inoculated into 1000 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 200 mL of seed medium (Jackson et al., 1993). The ﬂasks were incu- bated for 48 h at 30 �C on a rotary shaker (New Brunswick Scien- tiﬁc Co. Inc., model INNOVA TM 4300 – New Jersey, USA) operating at 120 rpm, with the mycelia vacuum ﬁltered from the culture broths (discarded) and transferred into 2000 mL Erlen- meyer ﬂasks containing 400 mL of Czapek fermentation medium (Alviano et al., 1992). One ﬂask was used for C. gloeosporioides cul- tivation (400 mL fermentation medium) while Fusarium spp. was cultivated in 12 ﬂasks (4800 mL fermentation medium). Cultures were incubated for an additional 6 days at 30 �C, 120 rpm. After fermentation, the culture broths of C. gloeosporioides and Fusarium spp. were separated from the mycelia by vacuum ﬁltration and ex- tracted with EtOAc (3 � 150 mL for C. gloeosporioides broth and 3 � 1800 mL for Fusarium ssp. broth) . The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum, yielding the EtOAc extracts. The EtOAc extract from C. gloeosporioides culture (123.7 mg) was subjected to silica gel 60 CC eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 4:1 (200 mL) and n-hexane/EtOAc 1:1 (100 mL) yielding 7 fractions. Sub-fraction 7 (34.1 mg), obtained from n-hexane/EtOAc 1:1, was subjected to silica gel 60 C8 reversed-phase CC eluted with MeOH/H2O 1:1 (300 mL) to yield 12 fractions. Sub-fraction 6 (3.9 mg) was puriﬁed using analytical reversed-phase HPLC (Shim-Pack CLC-ODS, 250/4.6 C18) with MeOH/H2O 1:1 as the mo- bile phase at a ﬂow rate 1 mL min�1, 260 nm to yield compounds 1 (1.1 mg; tR = 15.3 min) and 2 (1.1 mg; tR = 13.7 min). The EtOAc extract from the fermentation of Fusarium spp. (232.0 mg) was applied to a silica ﬂash (230–400 mesh) column eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 1:1 (625 mL), 1:4 (150 mL), EtOAc (100 mL) and MeOH (400 mL), yielding 10 fractions. Sub-fraction 8 (16.0 mg), obtained from n-hexane/EtOAc 1:4 was subjected to semi preparative reversed-phase HPLC (VP 250/10 NUCLEOSIL 120-5 C18) with MeCN/H2O 7:13 as the mobile phase at a ﬂow rate 4 mL min�1, 225 nm to yield compound 3 (0.6 mg; tR = 10.6 min). Fig. 2. Folded conformations obtained and investigated with MONTE CARLO/DFT for compounds 4 (a) and 6 (b). 1426 D.O. Guimarães et al. / Phytochemistry 71 (2010) 1423–1429 The mycelium of Fusarium spp. was extracted by maceration with MeOH for 7 days at room temperature. After this period, the mycelium was separated from the culture broth by vacuum ﬁltra- tion and discarded. The organic solvent was concentrated to yield the MeOH crude extract (9.4 g), which was suspended in MeOH/ H2O 1:3 (400 mL) and partitioned with CH2Cl2 and EtOAc, in se- quence, both for three consecutive times (150 mL each). The CH2Cl2 fraction was concentrated in vacuo, resuspended in MeOH (100 mL) and partitioned with n-hexane (3 � 100 mL). The MeOH fraction was combined with the EtOAc fraction yielding a crude ex- tract (974.9 mg). This extract was subjected to silica gel 60 CC eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 4:1 (300 mL), 1:1 (680 mL), EtOAc (100 mL) and MeOH (200 mL), yielding 9 fractions. Sub-fraction 7 spontaneously crystallized (11.4 mg) and the precipitate was washed with MeOH yielding compound 4 (6.7 mg). P. crustosum was cultivated in 35 Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (500 mL) containing 200 mL of Czapek medium (Alviano et al., 1992). The ﬂasks were incubated for 72 h at 25 �C on a rotary shaker operating at 200 rpm. The mycelia were vacuum ﬁltered from the culture broth (discarded) and transferred into 35 Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (500 mL) containing 200 mL of Czapek medium without glucose and supplemented with 20 mg of 1-tetralone per ﬂask. After fer- mentation, the culture broth of P. crustosum was separated from the respective mycelia by vacuum ﬁltration and extracted with EtOAc (3 � 100 mL each ﬂask). The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum yielding the EtOAc extract. The EtOAc extract from P. crustosum (700 mg) was subjected to silica gel 60 CC eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 7:3 (350 mL), 3:7 (350 mL) and EtOAc (350 mL), yielding 6 fractions. Sub-fraction 4 (81.4 mg), obtained from n-hex- ane/EtOAc 3:7, was subjected to semi preparative normal phase HPLC (LiChroCART 250–10-LiChrospher Si 60, 10 lm), mobile phase n-hexane/EtOAc 7:3 at a ﬂow rate 3 mL min�1, refractive in- dex detector (RID) to yield compounds 5 (7.4 mg; tR = 22.6 min), 6 (33.5 mg; tR = 79.4 min) and 7 (1.5 mg; tR = 62.3 min). Cultivation of P. crustosum under the same conditions as previously described, but adding of chlorogenic acid (20 mg) per ﬂask, instead of 1-tetra- lone at the fermentation step, also led to production of a crude ex- tract containing compounds 5 and 6. Compounds 5 and 6 were identiﬁed in the crude extract using 1H NMR spectroscopic and analytical HPLC analyses using the previously isolated compounds 5 and 6 as standards. P. crustosum was cultivated at the same con- ditions, but with no addition of either 1-tetralone or chlorogenic acid for control purposes, and HPLC proﬁle analyses of both cul- tures did not show the production of 5–7.

Molecular modeling procedures Conformational search was performed on DKPs 4, 5 and 6 using the MONTE CARLO method with the MMFF molecular mechanics model, thus implemented in the Spartan ‘06 1.1.2 software (Spar- tan, 2006). Two main low-energy conformations (extended and folded) were obtained and investigated for both compounds 4 and 6. Such conformers as well as the extended conformation of compound 5 were then fully optimized in gas phase at B3LYP/6- 31G* level of calculation. All of the quantum chemical methods used here were implemented in the Spartan ‘06 1.1.2 software. 4.5. Computational methodology for ECD Theoretical calculations for the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) were carried out in the solvent medium by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the PBE1PBE hybrid func- tional level and 6-31 + G* basis set. The choice of the functional was based on a recent extensive benchmarking (Jacquemin et al., 2009) comparing the merits of LDA, GGA, meta-GGA, global hy- brids, and long-range corrected hybrids in the prediction of sin- glet-excited states of (bio)-organic molecules and dyes. The PBE1PBE, also called PBE0 (Jacquemin et al., 2009), was one of the best functional matching the reference data. Although not shown, we have performed the calculations using the triple zeta Table 1 1H NMR, HMBC (H ?

D.O. Guimarães et al. / Phytochemistry 71 (2010) 1423–1429 1427 basis set but only minor differences were found. Thus, only calcu- lations with 6-31 + G* basis set are shown. Solvent effect (metha- nol) was included in the predictions using the Conductor Polarizable Continuum Model (CPCM). Rotational strengths (R), the parameter representing the intensity and sign of a Cotton ef- fect, were calculated by the Rosenfeld expression. In our case, the dipole velocity and dipole length forms for R were identical. For comparison between the theoretical and experimental ECD, the line spectrum is convoluted with Gaussian line shapes and scaled by the maximum value of the experimental data. On average, the Gaussian line shapes are taking into account the uncertainty prin- ciple, vibronic terms and interactions with the medium. All TDDFT calculations including CPCM were performed with Gaussian03 suite of programs (Frisch et al., 2003).
