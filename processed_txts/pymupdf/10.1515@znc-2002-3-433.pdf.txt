Naturforsch. 57c, 403Ð406 (2002); received October 31, 2001 Peritassa campestris, Hippocrateaceae, Campestrine, Seco-Quinonemethide Triterpenoids An investigation of the MeOH extract from the roots of Peritassa campestris (Hippocrateaceae) afforded two isomeric seco-A-ring quinonemethide triterpenoids, campestrine-I (1) and -II (2). This appears to be the first report of a C26-type triterpene carbon skeleton from the Celastraceae or Hippocrateaceae families. The struc- tures were elucidated on the basis of spectral data, par- ticularly HMQC, HMBC and NOE experiments. Introduction In the course of our continuing search for bio- active compounds from plants, following their tox- icity to brine shrimp larvae (Alkofahi et al., 1989), several bioactive quinonemethide triterpenoids were isolated previously (Lia˜o, 1997). These com- pounds, known as celastroloids, constitute a rela- tively small group of natural products encountered exclusively in plants of the families Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae. Celastroloids have been of interest due to their antitumour, antileukemic, an- timicrobial (Brüning and Wagner, 1978; Gunati- laka, 1996), antimalarial (Pavanand et al., 1989), 0939Ð5075/2002/0300Ð0403 $ 06.00 ” 2002 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen · www.znaturforsch.com · N and trypanocidal activities (Goijman et al., 1985). In this paper, we describe the isolation and identi- fication of two new isomeric triterpenes, camp- estrine-I (1) and -II (2), which are seco-A-ring qui- nonemethide triterpenoid derivatives, as well as six celastroloids, tingenone, 22-hydroxytingenone, 20-hydroxy-20-epi-tigenone, celastrol, pristimerin, and netzahualcoyene (Gunatilaka, 1996). These compounds were isolated from the roots of Peri- tassa campestris Cambess. (Hippocrateaceae), a plant that occurs in the Brazilian Savannah, popu- larly known as “bacupari do campo”, and used in folk medicine for wound healing in the form of a decoction (Septı´mio, 1994). Results and Discussion The MeOH extract from the roots of P. cam- pestris afforded, through droplet countercurrent chromatography (DCCC) and repeated chromato- graphic separation, the isomeric triterpenoids 1 and 2 in low yield, besides the known qui- nonemethide triterpenoids. Campestrine-I (1) showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 410 [M]+ in the EI-mass spectrum. The UV spectrum of 1 displayed absorption bands at 243 and 287 nm, and the IR spectrum showed a ketone band at 1708 cmÐ1 and an ester band at 1735 cmÐ1, indicating that the ester carbonyl group in C-2 was distorted, avoiding the steric crowding with C-11, in contrast with the spectral data for 2 (vide infra). The 1H NMR spectrum displayed signals for six methyl groups, one methoxy, three olefinic pro- tons, and one methine. These signals were very similar to those described for tingenone (Gunati- laka, 1989), particularly the signals for the E-ring, indicating a ketone group at C-21. The main differ- Unauthenticated Download Date | 2/17/17 2:00 AM 404 Notes ences observed were in the protons of the A- and B-rings, wherein H-1, H-6 and H-7 were shielded in comparison with those in tingenone. The multi- plicities were identical, however. In quinonemeth- ide triterpenoids like tingenone, typical signals are the singlets at δ 7.00 (1H, s) and 2.23 (3H, s), char- acteristic of the hydroxy and 23-Me groups, at- tached to C-3 and C-4, respectively. These signals were not observed in 1, but a singlet signal was observed at δ 1.76, reinforcing the differences ob- served in the protons of the A-ring. The long- range coupling observed between H-1 and H-6 (J = 2.0 Hz) indicated the coplanarity of the bonds involved. The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 revealed a carbonyl signal at δ 213.7, a carbomethoxy at δ 163.7, carbon signals associated with three double bonds at δ 103.7 (s), 110.7 (d), 115.9 (d), 126.4 (d), 161.1 (s) and 165.2 (s), one methoxyl, six methyl, six methylene, two methine, and four quaternary carbon signals. The absence of the methyl group attached to C-4 in quinonemethide triterpenolids, observed near δ 10.3 (23-Me), along with the pres- ence of only 8 sp2 carbons, corroborated the infor- mation that the differences between these com- pounds were in the A- and B-rings. The 13C NMR, HMQC and HMBC spectra supported the six- membered B-ring and a seco-A-ring, by the cross- peaks of the proton signal at δ 5.86 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-1) with the carbon resonances at δ 110.7 (C-1) and 126.4 (C-6); the proton signal at δ 6.38 (1H, dd, J = 6.8 and 2.0 Hz, H-6) with the carbon resonances at δ 103.7 (C-5), 126.4 (C-6), 161.1 (C- 8) and 165.2 (C-10); the proton signal at δ 6.06 (1H, d, J = 6.8 Hz, H-7) with the carbon reso- nances at δ 126.4 (C-6), 39.6 (C-9) and 44.1 (C- 14); the proton signal of the methyl at δ 1.53 (25- Me) with the cabon resonances at δ 161.1 (C-8) and 165.2 (C-10); the proton signal of the methyl at δ 1.30 (26-Me) with the carbon resonance at δ 161.1 (C-8); and proton signal of the methyl at δ 1.76 (4-Me) with the carbon resonances at δ 103.7 (C-5) and 126.4 (C-6). Campestrine-II (2) showed a ketone band at 1706 cmÐ1 and a conjugated ester band at 1685 cmÐ1 in its IR spectrum. The UV spectrum con- tained absorption maxima at 244 and 306 nm, also suggesting a conjugated chromophore, in contrast with 1. This triterpenoid showed NMR spectra very similar to those of 1. The 1H NMR spectrum indicated significant differences only in the hy- drogen signals for the A- and B-rings. In com- pound 2, the signals for H-1 and H-6 were more deshielded than in 1, and H-7 was more shielded. The tertiary methyl group attached to C-4, ob- served at δ 1.65 is more shielded (∆δ 0.11) than in 1. This information, and the differences observed for the carbon shifts of A- and B-rings in the 13C NMR spectrum, suggested that 1 and 2 are stereo- isomers, and the difference in their structure is only in the stereochemistry of the ∆1,10 double bond. This isomeric relationship was also sug- gested by the EI-mass spectrum of the mixture which showed the same fragmentation pattern. The cis or trans stereochemistry for the ∆1,10 double bond in 1 and 2, was determined by NOE experiments, which showed correlations in 1 of the proton signal at δ 5.86 (H-1) with the proton sig- nals at δ 1.76 (H-4) and 3.32 (OMe), indicating the trans configuration for this compound. Correla- tions of the proton signal at δ 5.84 (H-1) with the proton signals at δ 1.50 (H-25) and δ 3.33 (OMe) indicated the cis configuration for 2. This appears to be the first report of a C26-type carbon skeleton from the Celastraceae or Hip- pocrateaceae families (Brüning and Wagner, 1978; Gunatilaka, 1996).

Regelii (Takaishi et al., 1997) and celastranhydride, obtained from Ko- koona zeylanica (Gamlath et al., 1990), which are also seco-A-ring quinonemethide triterpenoid de- rivatives, are C27-type examples. Campestrine-I (1) and -II (2), which lack the typical quinonemethide chromophore, probably are formed by oxidative cleavage of A-ring, resulting in the two isolated stereoisomers.

Antunes, Departamento de Bo- taˆnica, Universidade Federal de Sa˜o Carlos, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, where a voucher specimen (no. 2845) is deposited. Extraction and isolation The roots were dried, powdered (2.8 kg) and successively extracted with hexane, CH2Cl2, and MeOH. The combined extracts were submitted to liquid-liquid partition, resulting in hexane, MeOH, EtOAc, 1-butanol and aqueous extracts. The MeOH extract (3.5 g) was submitted to droplet countercurrent chromatography (DCCC) using the aqueous layer of hexane: MeOH:H2O:EtOAc (5:4:1:2 v/v/v/v) as the stationary phase and the or- ganic layer as the mobile phase, in a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The collected fractions were moni- tored by TLC and grouped in 22 fractions. Frac- tions 13 and 14 were flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane: EtOAc (8:2 v/v), to afford tingenone and a mixture of triterpenoids. The latter was then purified by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexane: CH2Cl2:MeOH, 8:2:0.5 v/v/v) yielding campestrine-I (1, 2.1 mg) and a mixture containing 1 and 2. This mixture was rechromatographed on recycling HPLC using a Shim-pack column (silica 5 µm; 2.0¥25 cm; hexane: CH2Cl2:MeOH-8:2:0.5 v/v/v; flow rate: 3 ml/min; detection; UV 254 nm), affording campestrine-II (2, 1.0 mg).
