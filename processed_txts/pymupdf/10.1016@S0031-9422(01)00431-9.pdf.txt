Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from leaves of Piper arboreum yielded two new amides, N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) together with the known compounds N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E), 9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4). Catalytic hydrogenation of 3 yielded the amide N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]- pyrrolidine (5). We also have isolated six amides (6–11) and two antifungal cinnamoyl derivatives (12, 13) from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum. Compounds 1–11 showed antifungal activity as determined by direct bioautography against Cladosporium sphaerospermum while compounds 3-4 and 6–13 also showed antifungal activity against C. cladosporioides. # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Introduction Chemical studies carried out on Brazilian Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of pyrones, lig- noids and chromenes besides various amides bearing isobutyl, pyrrolidine, dihydropyridone and piperidine moieties (Das et al., 1996; Parmar et al, 1997; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Navickiene et al., 2000). These amides have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal and antifungal properties (Miyako et al., 1989; Bernard et al., 1995; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). In our previous papers, we have described the structures of the antifungal amides N-[7-(30,40-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-heptadie- noyl]pyrrolidine, (3Z,5Z)-N-isobutyl- 8-(30,40-methyle- nedioxyphenyl)-heptadienamide isolated from leaves of Piper hispidum H. B. K. (Ale´ cio et al., 1998) and 8(Z)-N- (12,13,14-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-�3-pyridin-2-one from Piper tuberculatum Jacq. (Navickiene et al., 2000), besides eight known antifungal amides. In this paper, we describe the isolation, the structure elucidation and the evaluation of the antifungal activity of two new amides N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)- pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (1), arboreumine (2) and nine (3–11) known antifungal amides N-[10- (13,14-methyle- nedioxyphenyl)-7(E)-pentaenoyl]-pyrrolidine (3), its deri- vative N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)-pentanoyl]- pyrrolidine (5) and N-[10-(13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl)- 7(E),9(E)-pentadienoyl]-pyrrolidine (4); besides pellitorine (6), �abdihydropiperine (7), piplartine (8), dihydro- piplartine (9), cis-piplartine (or 8(Z)-N-(12,13, 14- trimethoxycinnamoyl)-�3-pyridin-2-one) (10) and fagaramide (11). In addition to these amides we isolated two cinnamoyl derivatives, methyl 6,7,8-trimethoxy- dihydrocinnamate (12) and methyl trans-6,7,8-trimethox- ycinnamate (13). The amides isolated from leaves of Piper arboreum (1–4) and the hydrogenated derivative of 3 (5) were active against the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum, and the compounds isolated from seeds and leaves of Piper tuberculatum 3, 4 and 6–13 0031-9422/02/$ - see front matter # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results and discussion N-[10-(13,14-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-7(E),9(Z)-pen- tadienoil]-pyrrolidine (1) has a molecular formula of C16H17NO3 as determined by analysis of the electro- spray mass spectrum (ES–MS), elemental analyses and of the 13C NMR spectroscopic data. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1637 (conjugated carbonyl group); 1600, 1492 and 1442 (aromatic); 1246, 1192 and 1036 cm�1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of a 13,14-methylenedioxyphenyl group by the signal at � 5.93 (2H, s), and four oleﬁnic protons which showed signals at � 6.29 (1H, d, J7,8=14.3 Hz), 7.77 (1H, dd, J8,7=14.3 and J8,9=10.9 Hz), 6.20 (1H, dd, J9,8=10.9 and J9,10=11.4 Hz) and 6.59 (1H, d, J10,9= 11.4 Hz) indicative of an a,b,g,d-unsaturated carbonyl system. The coupling constant values indicated that the double bonds possess the E and Z geometry (Shah et al., 1986; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). The assignments of the E and Z conﬁgurations to hydrogens at C-7, C-8 and C-9, C-10, respectively were determined as follows; the doublet of doublets at � 7.77 (H-8) showed coupling constants of 14.3 and 10.9 Hz typical of trans-trans conﬁguration, which could be associated with an a,b unsaturated carbonyl system. The assign- ment of the cis conﬁguration for the g,� double bond was based on the coupling constant value 11.4 Hz between the H-9 and H-10 (Cleyn and Verzele, 1975). The presence of a pyrrolidine moiety was determined by the signals at � 3.52 (2H, m) and � 1.90 (2H, m) attrib- uted to H-2/H-5 and H-3/H-4, respectively. The 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1) of 1 were in full agreement supporting the presence of this moiety. The low-ﬁeld region of the 13C NMR spectrum exhibited signals assigned to an amide carbonyl at � 164.8, 10 sp2 car- bons, four sp3 carbons [�C 46.5, 45.8, 26.0, and 24.2], and a typical methylenedioxy carbon at � 100.7. The assignment of the remaining signals for the aromatic carbons were based on comparison with data described in the literature (Arau´ jo-Junior et al., 1997; Ale´ cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000). Arboreumine (2) was shown to have the molecular formula C25H40N2O5 by analysis of both its ES–MS spectrum and its elemental analyses. Its IR spectrum revealed absorption bands at 3400, 1700, 1659 and 1630 cm�1 characteristic of hydroxyl, carbonyl, conjugated amide carbonyl and a conjugated double bond, respec- tively. Its 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two doublets at � 2.15 (2H, J2a,2b�20a,20b=17.0 Hz) and 2.37 (2H, J2b,2a�20b,20a=17.0 Hz), attributed to H-2a, H- 20a and H-2b, H-20b which are characteristic of methyl- ene groups displaying geminal coupling. The presence of a hydroxyl group was further indicated by a signal assigned to a hydroxymethine hydrogen H-10, H-90, at � 4.29 (1H, dq, J10,9�90,80=5.0 Hz and J10,11�90,100=6.5 Hz). Three singlets of methyl protons at � 1.83, 1.00, 0.95 and one doublet at � 1.20 (J11,10�100,90=6.5 Hz) were assigned to H-12, H-110; H-13, H-120; H-14, H-130 and H-11, H-100, respectively. The signal at � 2.80 was attributed to the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen, as conﬁrmed by exchange with D2O in the 1H NMR experiment. The methine protons H-6, H-50; H-8, H-70 and H-9, H-80 showed signals at � 5.81 (q, J6,12�50,110= 1.0 Hz), 5.70 (dd, J8,9�70,80=15.5 Hz and J8,12�70,110=1,0 Hz) and 5.76 (dd, J9,8�80,70=15.5 Hz and J9,10�80,90=5.0 Hz), respectively (Table 2). Proton assignments were further conﬁrmed by analysis of the DQCOSY spec- trum. The spin system derived from H-8, H-70; H-9, H- 80 and H-10, H-90 was readily recognized by starting with the 1H doublet of doublets at � 5.76 assigned to H- 9, H-80 (J9,8�80,70=15.5 Hz and J9,10�80,90=5.0 Hz) which showed cross-peaks with 1H doublet of doublets at � 5.70 assigned to H-8, H-70 (J8,9�70,80=15.5 Hz and J8,12�70,110=1.0 Hz) and with a 1H doublet of quadruplet at � 4.29 assigned to H-10, H-90 (J10,9�90,80=5.0 Hz and J10,11�90,100=6.5 Hz). This last signal also showed a cross peak with the 3H doublet at � 1.20 assigned to H-11, H- 100 (J11,10�100,90=6.5 Hz). The 2H doublet at � 2.15 assigned to H-2a, H-20a (J2a,2b�20a,20b=17.0 Hz) showed cross-peak with the 2H doublet at � 2.37 assigned to H- 2b, H-20b (J2b,2a�20b,20a=17.0 Hz). The 13C NMR spec- tral data were in agreement with this unusual structure (Table 2). Besides, the signals of some carbons and the positions of attachment of various functionalities were unambiguously assigned following interpretation of the HMBC spectrum. The carbon signals at � 49.5 and 40.9 Table 1 1H and 13C NMR spectral data for amide 1 (ppm, CDCl3) Position 1 1H � [m, J (Hz), 200 MHz] 13C � (50 MHz) 2 3.52 (2H, m) 45.8 3 1.90 (2H, m) 26.0 4 1.90 (2H, m) 24.2 5 3.52 (2H, m) 46.5 6 – 164.8 7 6.29 (1H, d, J7,8=14.3) 121.1 8 7.77 (1H, dd, J8,7 and 8,9=14.3, 10.9) 144.4 9 6.20 (1H, dd, J9,8 and 9,10=10.9, 11.4) 121.0 10 6.59 (1H, d, J10,9=11.4) 134.9 11 – 127.0 12 6.78 (1H, d, J12,16=1.7) 108.1 13 – 145.6 14 – 147.5 15 6.75 (1H, d, J15,16=8.1) 108.7 16 6.82 (1H, dd, J16,15 and 16,12=8.1, 1.7) 122.1 OCH2O 5.93 (2H, s) 100.7 R. Vasques da Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 59 (2002) 521–527 523 assigned to C-2, C-20 and C-3, C-30, respectively showed a correlation with the 3H singlets at � 1.00, 0.95 (assigned to the two methyl groups attached to the car- bon (C-3 and C-30), whereas the cross-peak between the carbon signal at � 198.3 and the 3H singlet at � 0.95 (C- 14 and C-130) indicated the quaternary carbon C-3, C-30 was adjacent to the carbonyl group C-4. At the same time, the carbonyl carbon at � 198.3 (C-4) displayed a correlation with H-2a, H-20a and H-2b, H-20b (� 2.15 and 2.37, respectively). These last protons also showed a cross-peak with the quaternary carbon C-3, C-30 (� 40.9). The cross-peaks between H-13, H-120 and C-14, C-130 and H-14, H-130 and C-13, C-120 were also observed. The carbon signals at � 163.9 (C-5, C-40), 126.1 (C-6, C-50) and 40.9 (C-3, C-30) showed a correla- tion with the 1H singlet at � 2.80 (assigned to the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen atom). Irradiation of the proton resonance at � 2.80 (N-H) in the 2D NOESY experiment caused an enhancement (9%) of the signal at � 2.15 (H-2a, H-20a), corroborating the adjacent rela- tionship between the amide group and C-2, C-20. The carbon signals at � 67.3 (C-10, C-90) and 135.6 (C-9, C- 80) showed cross-peak with the 3H doublet at � 1.20 indicating the presence of the methyl group C-11, C-100 adjacent to the hydroxymethine carbon. The a,b,g,�- unsaturated carbonyl carbon system was unambigu- ously assigned by the correlation between the proton signal at � 1.83 assigned to the methyl group at the position 12, 110 with the carbon signals � 126.1 (C-6, C- 50) and 128.6 (C-8, C-70), whereas the quadruplet at � 5.81 assigned to H-6, H-50 (J6,12�50,110=1,0 Hz) showed a cross peak with the carbon signals at � 163.9 (amide carbonyl carbon) and 128.6 (C-8, C-70). Finally, HET- COR analyses were used to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons and the structure of amide 2 was determined as depicted. The CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1) extracts from the seeds and leaves of P. tuberculatum were fractionated by column chromatography on silica gel eluted with C6H14 con- taining increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 100%), followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to aﬀord compounds 6–13. Pellitorine (6) was obtained from fraction 13 from extract seeds, without any further puriﬁcation, and it was identiﬁed by direct comparison of its spectroscopic data with the data pre- viously described by Rosario et al., 1996. �a,bdihydro piperine (7) and dihydropiplartine (9) had their 1H NMR spectra published for the same compounds pre- viously isolated from Piper rugosum (Maxwell and Rampersad, 1991) and Piper guineense (Parmar et al., 1997) and their 13C NMR spectral data recently pub- lished (Navickiene et al., 2000). Piplartine (8) was iso- lated from seeds and leaves, and the 1H and 13C NMR data were similar those published (Duh et al., 1990; Filho et al., 1981). Cis-piplartine (10) had its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data recently published (Navickiene et al., 2000). Fagaramide (11) was isolated from leaf extract and its spectroscopic data were compared with those published (Isao, 1984). Methyl trans-6,7,8-tri- methoxycinnamate (13) was previously described as a synthetic product (Settimj et al., 1976) and its spectro- scopic data were similar to that obtained in this work. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–13 was deter- mined by means of direct bioautography on TLC plate (Homans and Fuchs, 1970). The detection limits of com- pounds 1–13 (Tables 3 and 4) were obtained according to methodology described (Rahalison et al., 1994). The compounds having no inhibition for C. sphaerospermum and C. cladosporioides growth at amounts higher than 10.0 mg were too weak to be considered. The minimum amount of compounds 3–4; 2 and 5; and 1 required to inhibit growth of the fungus C. sphaero- spermum on the TLC plates was determined as 0.1 mg, 5.0 mg and 10.0 mg, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 showed strong antifungal activity, higher than the stan- dards miconazole (0.5 mg) and nystatin (0.5 mg). These two compounds also showed high activity against C. cladosporioides, the amide 4 being 50 times more active when compared with the reference compounds. In the case of compounds 6–10, 13 and 11, 12 the minimum amount to inhibit the growth of the fungus C. clados- porioides on the TLC plates was determined as 5.0 and 10.0 mg, respectively. The higher limit detection of 5 mg values found for 6–10 and 13 indicated a moderate activity of these amides when compared to that observed with the standards miconazole and nystatin. The inhibition of fungal growth displayed for these compounds suggests that the pyrrolidine amides isolated from P. arboreum are substantially stronger antifungal agents than the Table 2 1H and 13C NMR spectral data for amide 2 (ppm, CDCl3) Position 2 1H � [m, J (Hz), 500 MHz] 13C �a (125 MHz) 1, 10 2.80 (1H, s) – 2a, 20a 2.15 (1H, d, J2a,2b�20a,20b=17.0) 49.5 (t) 2b, 20b 2.37 (1H, d, J 2b,2a�20b,20a=17.0) 3, 30 – 40.9 (s) 4 – 198.3 (s) 5, 40 – 163.9 (s) 6, 50 5.81 (1H, q, J6,12�50,110=1.0) 126.1 (d) 7, 60 – b 8, 70 5.70 (1H, dd, J8,9�70,80 and 8,12�70,110=15.5, 1.0) 128.6 (d) 9, 80 5.76 (1H, dd, J9,8�80,70 and 9,10�80,90=15.5, 5.0) 135.6 (d) 10, 90 4.29 (1H, dq, J10,9�90,80 and 10,11�90,100=5.0, 6.5) 67.3 (d) 11, 100 1.20 (3H, d, J 11,10�100,90=6.5) 23.4 (q) 12, 110 1.83 (3H, s) 19.0 (q) 13, 120 1.00 (3H, s) 22.7 (q) 14, 130 0.95 (3H, s) 23.8 (q) a Multiplicities of carbons (in parentheses) determined by a DEPT experiment. b This signal was not observed in the 13C NMR spectrum. 524 R.

It is important to note that the inhibi- tion of C. sphaerospermum by dihydropyridone amide 9 appears to be higher than the standard nystatin [(0.1 mg) compared with nystatin (0.5 mg)] (Navickiene et al., 2000) while the inhibition of C. cladosporioides was lower than the standards (Table 4). 3. Experimental 3.1. Instrumentation and chromatography materials Silica gel (Merck 230–400 mesh) was used for all col- umn chromatography unless otherwise stated and sol- vents were redistilled prior to use. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 500 MHz and 13C NMR at 50 and 125 MHz, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spec- trometer. ES–MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Varian PrepStar LC/UV/VIS model SD-1, using a reversed phase column (Supelcosil C18; 21.2�250 mm) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1), ﬂow rate of 10.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. Elemental analyses were per- formed on a 2400 CHN Perkin-Elmer Analyser. 3.2. Plant material Piper arboreum H. B. K. leaves were collected in Araraquara—SP, Brazil and identiﬁed by Dr. Guil- lermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher specimens (Cordeiro-1936) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Bio- cie.ncias—USP, Sa˜ o Paulo—SP, Brazil. Piper tuberculatum Jacq. seeds, leaves and stems were collected in the Campus do INPA—Manaus, Brazil, and identiﬁed by Dr. Guillermo E.D. Paredes (Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Peru). The voucher speci- mens (Kato-163) are deposited at Herbarium of Instituto de Biocie.ncias—USP, Sa˜ o Paulo—SP, Brazil. 3.3. Antifungal assays The microorganisms used in the antifungal assays C. sphaerospermum (Penzig) SPC 491 and C. cladospor- ioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 have been maintained at the Instituto de Bota.nica, Sa˜ o Paulo, SP, Brazil. For the antifungal assay—10.0 ml of solutions corresponding to 100.0 mg of crude extract and 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.1 mg of pure compound were applied to pre-coated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with C6H14:EtOAc (7:3) for compounds 1–5 and with CH2Cl2:MeOH (97:3) for compounds 6–13, after that the plates were dried for complete removal of solvents. The chromatograms were sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum or C. cladosporioides in glucose and salt solution (Rahalison et al., 1994) and incubated for 72 h in dark- ness in a moistened chamber at 25 �C. Clear inhibition zone appeared against a dark background indicating the minimal amount of 1–5 and 6–13 required for it (Tables 3 and 4). Nystatin and miconazole were used as positive controls whereas ampicillin and chlor- amphenicol were used as negative controls. 3.4. Extraction and isolation of constituents A CH2Cl2 soluble part of the MeOH:H2O (4:1) extract of leaves of P. arboreum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to give the amides 1–4. The dried and powdered leaves of P. arboreum (2000.0 g) were extracted three times with 2000 ml of EtOH, during 2 days, at room temperature. The result- ing EtOH extract was ﬁltered and conc. in vacuo to aﬀord 245.8 g of a green gum, which was solubilized in MeOH:H2O (4:1), and extracted with C6H14, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc respectively.

Fraction 19 (1.7 g) was applied to a C18 HPLC column (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). After that the fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC [CH2Cl2: (CH3)2CO (92:02) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding 1 (28.0 mg) and 3 (31.0 mg). Fraction 21 (0.5 g) was applied to a C18 col- umn (2.0 g) eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). The resulting fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC eluted with CH2Cl2:(CH3)2CO:MeOH (92:0.5:0.5) and HOAc (1%) to give 2 (8.0 mg). Fraction 23 (0.5 g) was applied to a C18 column (2.0 g) and eluted with MeOH:H2O (4:1). The resulting fractions were puriﬁed by prep. TLC [CH2Cl2:C6H14: (CH3)2CO (6:3:1) and HOAc (1%), three elutions] yielding 3 (83.0 mg) and 4 (30.0 mg). The dried and powdered seeds and leaves of P. tuber- culatum (24.3 g) were extracted 2� with 600 ml of CH2Cl2:MeOH (2:1), during 2 days (each extraction), at room temperature. The resulting extract of seeds was ﬁltered and conc. in vacuo to aﬀord 2.9 g of a green gummy residue. Part of this extract (2.0 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography, eluted with C6H14:EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity to give 36 fractions (15 ml). Fraction 21 (77.0 mg) was submitted to a prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (3:2), three elutions] to yield 8 (33.0 mg) and 10 (25.0 mg). Fraction 19 (83.0 mg), submitted to prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (75:25), three elutions], yiel- ded 9 (7.0 mg). Fractions 8 (0.2 g) and 13 (39.0 mg) yielded compounds 6 (0.2 g) and 7 (18.0 mg), respec- tively, without any further puriﬁcation. The leaf extract (56.9 g), submitted to CC (2000.0 g) [C6H14:EtOAc (4:1) in gradient of polarity] yielded 70 fractions. Fractions 26–62 (32.0 g) were pooled and submitted to CC (1000.0 g), with the same solvent system as described earlier. Fraction 66 (0.9 g) yielded the amide 8 (0.9 g), without further puriﬁcation. Amide 11 (7.0 mg) was isolated from fraction 55 (0.2 g), which was further puriﬁed by reversed phase HPLC [MeOH:H2O(4:1)]. Fraction 28 (0.4 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (3:2), two elutions] yielding the cinnamoyl derivative 12 (66.0 mg) and fraction 67–68 (0.4 g) was puriﬁed by two prep. TLC [C6H14:EtOAc (4:1), two elutions and C6H14: EtOAc (7:3), one elution], respectively, to yield the cin- namoyl derivative 13 (13.0 mg). 3.5.
