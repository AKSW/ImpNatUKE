Abstract-20-Dcoxocarnosol,  isolated from the stems of Coleus bmbutus, was shown by chemical and spectral methods  to be a new phenolic diterpene with an abietane skeleton.  INTRODUCHON  As a part of our studies on the cardioactive dichloro-  methane crude extract of the false boldo, Coleus burbatus  Bentham (Labiatae) [l-3], we isolated a new diterpene, 20-  deoxocarnosol (l), as a crystalline light yellow solid [mp  173.5-175.5”; [a]n = - 78.7” (c 1.00, CHCl,); yield: 0.06 %  from dry plant material]. I wish to report now on the  structure elucidation of 1.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  High resolution mass spectrometry of 1 established the  empirical  formula  C,,H,,O,  (316.2056,  requires  316.2039). The IR spectrum  showed the presence of  hydroxyl functions (v,  3560 and 3480cm-‘) that under-  went acetylation to furnish a diacetate 2 devoid of further  hydroxyl  absorptions  in  the  IR  spectrum.  IR  (v,  1765 cm-‘) and ‘H NMR spectral data (6 2.29 and  *Present  address: Department  of  General  Biology,  Universidade  Federal  Fluminense,  Caixa Postal  183, 24.000  Niter6i RJ, Brazil.  2.30, OAc) of 2 suggested the phenolic nature of both  hydroxyl groups in 1. The UV spectrum of 1 coniirmed the  latter conclusion and indicated that the hydroxyl groups  were not paru to each other [4]. The ortho relationship  between them came from Ag,O oxidation of 1 into the  unstable o-quinone 3 identified by its IR and UV spectra  rz51 (v,  1670 and 1650cm-‘;  1,222,  loga3.76 and  428nm, loge3.28). The pentasubstituted  nature of the  aromatic ring came from ‘H NMR and “C NMR spectral  data (lH, br s at 6 6.58; six aromatic carbons 5s and Id, see  Table 1). The ‘H NMR spectrum of 1 also showed signals  for two methyl groups on a quaternary carbon (two 3H, s  at 60.86 and 1.14) and for an isopropyl group (6H,d,J  = 7 Hz at S 1.25 and 1 H hept, J = 7 Hz at 6 3.16). The  small upfield shift (A6 0.24 ppm) of the isopropyl methine  signal, observed on acetylation, indicated that the iso-  propyl group was linked to the phenol moiety. Moreover,  the non-equivalence of the isopropyl methyl groups in the  ‘H NMR spectrum of diacetate 2 (two 3H, d, J = 7 Hz at  6 1.17 and 1.21) suggested that a hydroxyl was probably  vicinal to the isopropyl group of 1. These data allowed  three different arrangements of the aromatic substituents  (A-C). Among them, B could be eliminated since 1 gave a  n  B  C  /  ‘.  1677  1678  A. KELECOM  Table 1.

Fragment A accommodates with an abietane  (A,) but also with a sempervirol type compound (AZ). The  latter could be discarded since the l/I-H of 1 was found to  be deshielded to 6 2.65 due to the ‘rabbit-ear effect’ [S] of  the hydroxyl group at C-11. Additional support for the  abietane skeleton was obtained from the ’ % NMR spec-  trum of 1 (Table 1) which also showed that the third  oxygen atom of 1 was part of a -CH-O-CH,-  ether  moiety (6 71.11,d and 68.48, dd). This was further sub-  stanciated by the poorly resolved dd at 6 4.72 ( J = 3.9 and  1SHz) for the H-7 and by the AB quartet observed at  63.08 and 4.31 (1H each, d, J = 9 Hz) attributable  to the  hydrogens of the oxymethylene moiety. The greater than  1 ppm difference in chemical shifts proved that the latter  two hydrogens were in very different environments,  and  suggested that one hydrogen points towards and the other  away from the aromatic ring, a requirement  only com-  patible with the ether being located at C-20. Comparison  of the 13C NMR spectral data of the methyl groups of 1,  with those of ferruginol (4) [lo, 111 (Table 1) confirmed  this assignment. This structure was also supported by the  mass spectrum of 1 which was dominated by an ion at  m/z286 corresponding  to the loss of a CH,O fragment  from the molecular ion, and it is known that the fragmen-  tation giving rise to the base peak, in the abietatriene series,  is the loss of the C-10 substituent [12]. Furthermore, both  the chemical shift and the multiplicity’of the signal at 6 4.72  indicated that the cyclic ether of 1 closed  at the C-7  benzylic position. A Dreiding model showed that, in an  abietane derivative, any six-membered ring from C-20 to  I  R=H  5  R=H  2  R=Ac  6  R=OH  C-7 necessarily creates an a-oriented H-7. This orientation  was further confirmed by the coupling constants of the C-7  hydrogen [ 131. Hence, 1 is 7&20-oxidoabieta-8,11,13-  trien-11,12-diol and it is thus the 20-deoxo derivative of  carnosol(5) [13,14]. Additional support for the proposed  structure  was furnished  by the large y-gauche effect  observed in the “CNMR  spectra of 1 and 2 on C-5,  shielded by ca 8 ppm, and the important anti-periplanar  effect on C-l, shielded by ca 9 ppm from their positions in  4 (Table 1). In turn, C-10 was deshielded by ca 3 ppm.  Since compounds  1 and 5 possess identical asymmetric  carbons, the molecular rotation of 1 ([a],, = -248.7”)  strongly supported the proposal that 1 has the same  absolute configuration as 5 ([@lo = - 249.9”) [15], i.e. 1  belongs to the normal series, a conclusion also arrived at  from biogenetic considerations [2,3]. It is peculiar to note  that,  although  20-deoxocarnosol  (1)  and  6/L  hydroxycarnosol(6)  [3] are both found in C. barbatus, no  carnosol (5) could be detected in this plant.  EXPERIMENTAL  All the equipment  used for this work has been described  previously [2].  Isolation of 20_deoxocarnosol(l). Coleus barbatus Bentham was  collected in the surroundings  of Rio de Janeiro during October  1981. Leaves and stems were separated, air-dried, and the stems  pulverized  in a hammer mill. The stems (1 kg) were extracted  successively with hexane, EtOAc and MeOH at room temp. for  several days. The hexane crude extract was evaporated under red.  pres. to afford a brownish residue (21 g) which was dissolved in  MeOH (50 ml). The insoluble material (7 g) was filtered off and the  filtrate coned to a vol. of 10 ml. Aliquots of 2 ml were applied on a  Sephadex LH-20 column (200ml bed volume) eluted with pure  MeOH. 20Deoxocarnosol  (1) was eluted from the column  together  with  (+)-ferruginol  (4),  barbatusol  [Z],  68-  hydroxycarnosol(6)  [3] and several other minor diterpenes. Silica  gel column chromatography  (eluted with a gradient of EtOAc  from 10 to 25% in hexane) afforded 1 still contaminated  with  Abietane diterpenoids from Coleus barbatus  1679  another  unknown  diterpene.
