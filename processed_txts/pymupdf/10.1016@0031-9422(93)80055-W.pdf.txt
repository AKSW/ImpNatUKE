Abstract--The stems of Pilocarpus riedelianus have afforded the new angular furocoumarins 3-methoxyangelicin and  3,6-dimethoxyangelicin, in addition to the known sphondin, pimpinellin, scopoletin, aurapten, osthol and meranzin  hydrate. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectral data.  INTRODUCTION  The genus Pilocarpus has long been known as the most  important source of the alkaloid pilocarpine, a useful  medicine for the treatment of glaucoma and other dis-  eases [1]. Recent reports reveal the presence of aliphatic  ketones, pilocarpamide and (-)-episesamine in P. tra-  chyllopus [2], dammarane triterpenes in P. spicatus [3]  and coumarins in P. goudotianus [4].  In this paper, we report the isolation and structural  elucidation of the new coumarins 3-methoxyangelicin (1)  and 3,6-dimethoxyangelicin (2) in addition to the known  sphondin, pimpinellin, scopoletin, aurapten, osthol and  meranzin hydrate from a dichloromethane extract of the  stems of P. riedelianus. Their structures were elucidated  on the basis of spectral data.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Compound 1 gave a blue fluorescent spot on TLC. Its  1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) revealed the presence of five  resonances, corresponding to five protons, in the aro-  matic region (t56.9-7.7) besides a singlet (63.92) for the  three protons typical of a methoxyl group. The ~ 3C NMR  spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of 12 signals.  These data, together with the [M] ÷ (m/z 216), 5157.7  (13CNMR) and 1727 cm -1 (IR) suggested a coumarin  with the molecular formula C ~ 2HsO4. Further analysis of  the 1HNMR for 1 showed signals characteristic of a  disubstituted furan ring, an AB coupling system (J  = 8.9 Hz) and a singlet. These data together with the  long-range coupling observed between H-Y and H-6  allowed us to propose an angular arrangement for the  *Permanent address: Departamento de Quimica, Universi-  dade Federal do Parfi, Campus Universitfirio, Guamfi, 66030  Bel6m, PA, Brazil.

On the other hand, the absence of a pair of  doublets characteristic of H-3 and H-4 indicated that  either H-3 or H-4 is substituted. This is in agreement with  the placement of the methoxyl in one of those positions.  The placement of the methoxyl at C-3 was revealed by  NOE experiments where irradiation of either H-5 or the  methoxyl caused an effect in the signal (66.95). This  experiment also led unequivocally to the assignment of  H-4 to the signal at 66.95.  Through several experiments such as DEPT and  ~H-~3C COSY it was also possible to assign the carbons  in the ~3C NMR. The other resonances were assigned  through comparison with model compounds I-6, 7-1. All  the evidence above is in agreement with the structure of 3-  methoxyangelicin for 1.  The I H NMR spectrum of 2 (Table 1), together with the  I-M] ÷ (m/z 246) suggested that this compound was a 3-  methoxyangelicin derivative. The placement of the addi-  tional methoxyl group (64.07) at C-6 was confirmed by  both NOE experiments and the absence of long-range  coupling between H-3' and the benzene protons. This  evidence supports the structure of 3,6-dimethoxy-  angelicin for 2.  The known coumarins were identified by comparison  of their spectral data with those reported in the literature  [8-13]. Coumarins are widely distributed in plant spe-  cies, but the occurrence of 3-methoxycoumarins in the  Rutaceae has not been reported previously.  EXPERIMENTAL  General. UV and IR were recorded in MeOH and  CHCI3, respectively. 1H and ~3CNMR spectra were  recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, in CDCI 3 with  TMS as int. standard. MS were obtained at 70 eV (probe).  Plant material. Pilocarpus riedelianus was collected in  the State of Esplrito Santo, Brazil, in June 1986. A  voucher specimen is deposited at Herbarium of the  Instituto de BiociSncias da Universidade de Sao Paulo,  SP, Brazil.  Extraction and isolation. Stems (750 g) were ground  and extracted with hexane, CH2C12 and MeOH, respect-  ively. The CH2C12 extract (8.8 g) was submitted to  vacuum chromatography over silica gel using hexane,  CH2C12, EtOAc and MeOH as eluents. The EtOAc fr.  (6.9 g) subjected to CC over silica gel using hexane,  CH2C12, EtOAc and MeOH at different ratios of increas-  ing polarity, furnished 22 frs. Fr. 12 was purified by prep.  TLC (silica gel; hexane-EtOAc, 4: 1) to yield aurapten  (12 mg) and osthol (8 mg). Frs 13 and 14 were submitted  to CC over silica gel eluting with hexane-Me2CO  (9: 1) affording 1 (8 mg). Fr. 16 after CC over silica gel  eluting with CH2CI2-MeOH (19:1) afforded 45 new frs.  Fr. 16/I was purified by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexane-  Me2CO, 7:3) to yield sphondin (9 mg) and pimpinellin  (8 mg). Fr. 16/L was purified by prep. TLC (silica gel;  CH2CI2-MeOH, 4:1) to yield 2 (5 mg). Fr. 16/M was  purified by prep. TLC (silica gel; hexane-Me2CO, 1 : 1) to  yield scopoletin (4 mg). Frs 19-21 were submitted to CC  over silica gel eluting with CH2CI2-MeOH (19:1) af-  fording 46 new frs. Frs 19-21/N were purified by prep.
