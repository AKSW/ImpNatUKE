ABSTRACT.-From  the leaves of Strychnospseudoquina (Loganiaceae), isorhamnetin (1)  and  a new biflavone (2) named strychnobiflavone were isolated together with the alkaloids diaboline  and 1 I-methoxydiaboline.  Strychnospseudoquina St. Hil. (Loganiaceae) is a medium-size tree that grows in the  Brazilian “cerrado” where it is well known by the trivial names of “quina do campo” and  “falsa quina.” It is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of malaria and for the  preparation of the so-called “aqua inglesa,” largely used in Brazil as a tonic and feb-  rifuge and also to relieve stomach pains ( 1,2).  In a previous paper (3) it was demonstrated that no quinine was present in the bark  of the roots, of the trunk, and of the branches, but a number of indole alkaloids, mainly  nor-dihydrotoxiferine, were present. Later, 1 1-methoxydiaboline and 1 l-methoxy-  Wieland-Gumlich aldehyde were found in the bark (4).  In the present paper we have investigated the leaves ofS. pseudoquina, which contain  both alkaloids and flavonoids.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Ground and dried leaves of S. pseudoquina were exhaustively extracted with EtOH.  Part of the residue was reextracted according to the usual procedure for alkaloids. Two  main alkaloids were isolated by counter-current distribution (ccd) at discontinuously  decreasing pH ( 5 )  and were identified as diaboline and 1 1-methoxydiaboline by direct  comparison and analysis of the spectral data. Diaboline and 1 1-methoxydiaboline have  been independently found in several Strychnos species of American and African origins  (6), but their concomitant occurrence is not common. They are precursors of quaternary  alkaloids, such as nordihydrotoxiferine, found in other parts of the plant. In the leaves  of this sample, quaternary alkaloids were absent, confirming their usual absence in ae-  rial parts.  Another part of the residue was extracted with EtOAc. In this extract, five  flavonoids were evident by tlc; the two main ones were isolated by column chromatog-  raphy. The less polar was identified as isorhamnetin (1) by analysis of chemico-physical  and spectral data (7). The second product, 2, mp 2 17-2 19”, showed an uv spectrum  similar to that of isorhamnetin (1) and analogous shifts after addition of AlCI, and  AlCl,/HCI. ‘H-nmr spectra of 2 (in Me,CO-d6) showed the following sets of signals: (a)  two methoxy groups (6 3.82 and 3.63); (b) two doublets (6 5.84 and 6.10,J=2 Hz)  and a sharp singlet (6 6.26) attributed to the protons of A rings, showing that one of the  ligation sites was in the 6 or 8 position; (c) the other signals in the aromatic region  showed a trisubstituted and a tetrasubstituted system pertinent to I-B and 11-B rings;  and (d) two chelated hydroxy groups (6 12.6 and 12.8), indicating a possible  954  Journal of Natural Products  rvoi. 47, N ~ .   6  1 R=H  I '   3 R=Me  on  O  5 R=R'=Me  biflavonoid structure. All these indications were well confirmed by the 13C-nmr spec-  trum of 2 (in Me,CO-d6, see Table 1). The majority of the peaks were duplicated, in  comparison with those in the cmr spectrum of the 3,7,4' trimethyl derivative of  TABLE  1.

Each of the side phenyl rings appeared to be substituted by two  phenolic hydroxyls, ortho to each other. The signals of two methoxy groups were also  present and, by their chemical shifts, they seemed ortho, ortho' disubstituted; methoxy  carbon atoms ortho, ortho' disubstituted resonate at lower fields (- 60 ppm), whereas or-  dinary OMe groups are usually found between 55-57 ppm (8). In 2 ,  OMe groups could  be assigned to position 3 (rings I-C and 11-C) in consideration of the chemical shifts of  carbon atoms of rings A and by comparison of 3 with literature data (9).  Thus, the structure of a biflavonoid methoxylated at psition 3 could be assigned to  compound 2 ,  to which we propose the name of strychnobiflavone.  By reaction wih ethereal CH,N2, the hexamethyl derivative of 2 (4), mp 233-234",  was obtained.  The ms spectrum of 4 showed, besides the molecular peak at m/z 7 14 (47%), the  M+- 1 peak characteristic of the fragmentation pattern of flavonols. The most signifi-  cant ions were at m/z 357 (30) corresponding to either the doubly charged molecular  ion, M++, or the fission product hU2 '+,  and at m/z 167 (15) and 165 (58) attributable  to ions related to I-A and 11-B rings, respectively, by analogy with other flavonoids (7).  The 'H-nmr spectrum of 4 in CDCI, showed two sets of methoxy groups (three at  - 4.0 pprn and five between 3.4 and 3.8 ppm) partially overlapped, whereas in  Me2CO-d6 all eight signals were located between 6 3.56 and 4.00. Two low-field sig-  nals were present (6 13.20 and 13.54, exchangeable with D,O), and they could again  be assigned to the two hydroxy groups in position 5 (rings I-A and 11-A) chelated by the  carboxyl groups at position 4 (rings I-C and 11-C). The aromatic signals were now  clearly separated, and on the basis of their multiplicities the first site of attachment of  the two monomers could be assigned to position 2' of one of the benzene rings. The  13C-nmr spectrum of 4, in comparison with that of 2 ,  showed as the main difference,  aside from the effects due to the methylation, the pattern of the aromatic substitution.  Finally, by reaction of 2 with K2C03/Me2S04 the octamethyl derivative (5, mp 269-  27 1') was obtained in order to methylate also the hydroxyl groups in position 5 (rings  I-A and 11-A), and thus assign the second coupling site. Cmr data of 5, in comparison  with those of 4, showed the effect of methylation at C(5) in accordance with reported  data for flavonoids (9), i.e., strong shielding of C(4), deshielding of C(3) and shielding  of C(2). Two signals of the three aromatic methynes of A rings appeared shielded by the  effect of the methylation, assigning the second site of attachment to the 8 position. As  an independent confirmation, no additional OMe peaks appeared at - 60 ppm and  seven OMe peaks were present at higher field.  Thus the structure of 1-5, 1-7, 1-3', 1-4', 11-5, 11-7, 11-3', II-4'-octahydroxy-I-3,  11-3-dimethoxy 11-2'; 11-81 biflavone was assigned to strychnobiflavone (2). Only in a  chromatographic study on African species was the presence of flavonoids and related  compounds in Strychnos previously reported ( 10). Therefore, the finding of flavonoids in  S. pseudoquina is interesting from a chemotaxonomic standpoint.  EXPERIMENTAL  GENERAL  EXPERIMENTAL.-A Craig-Post apparatus (200 stages, 10: 10 ml, upper and lower phase)  was used for ccd. 'H-nmr and "C-nmr spectra were recorded with a Varian XL 100 spectrometer (using  TMS as internal reference). Ms spectra were registered on a LKB 9000 S spectrometer.  PLANT MATERIAL.-hVeS  of S. pseudoqnina were collected near Brasilia, Brazil, and identified at  the Universidade Federal de Alagoas:Maceio, Brazil, where a voucher specimen (no. SPQ 8 1) is deposited.  The material (3 kg) was dried at 40". powdered, and exhaustively extracted with EtOH to yield, after evap-  oration of the solvent, a residue that amounted to - 12% of the starting material.  ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE ALKALOIDS.-Part  of the residue (50 g) was extracted  with a 2% HOAc until a negative Dragendorff reaction occurred. The aqueous extract was made alkaline  by adding NaHCO, and extracted twice wirh CHCl;. The organic phase, after evaporation of the solvent,  956  Journal of Natural Products  [Vol. 47, No. 6  yielded a residue (2.5 g) which, by analysis on silica gel (C6H6-EtOAc-diethylamine,  5:4: l), resulted in  two main compounds. In the aqueous phase quaternary alkaloids were absent. The alkaloidal mixture was  separated by ccd between CHCI, and aphosphate-citric acid buffer: at pH 7.0, diaboline (k,kk,=9 X lo-’),  and at pH 6.0, 11-methoxydiaboline (kAk,=6x lo-*) were isolated.

ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE FLAvONOIDS.-Another  part of the ethanolic residue  (100 g) was extracted with EtOAc in a Soxhlet apparatus. The extract (20 g) by tlc analysis on silica gel  (EtOAc-toluene, 3:2) resulted in two main compounds. By chromatography on silica gel in EtOAc-  toluene (3:2), pure isorhamnetin (1, 380 mg) and strychnobiflavone (2, 2 10 mg) were obtained from 5 g of  the extract.
