INTRODUCTION  Humirianthera  rupestris (Icacinaceae)  is a shrub whose  tuber,  weighing  about  40 kg, is eaten  like flour after  several water washings  [l 1. A chemical investigation  of a  tuber collected  in Manaus  (Amazon)  Brazil revealed the  presence  of six new degraded  diterpenoids.  RESULTS  The benzene  and ethanol  extracts  from the tuber of  Humirianthera  rupestris  contained  sitosterol  and  six  crystalline  substances,  for which the names  humirian-  thenolide  A (la), B (lb), C (2a), D (3), E (4a) and F (4b)  are proposed.  2a  R=H  2b  R =Ac  Humirianthenolide  A (la), C17H2205,  possessed  a y-  lactone  (IR:  1766cm-’  and  13CNMR:  6179.9),  hemiacetal  (13CNMR:  6 96.8), saturated  ketone  (IR:  1710cm-’  and  13CNMR:  6 212.4)  and  C-Me  (‘HNMR  s, 3H,  6 1.37) functions,  and  contained,  therefore,  five rings.

H-6 appeared  as a broad triplet,  with almost no coupling  with H-78. This observation  is  best explained  by a chair-ring  B with the lactonic oxygen  substituent  in an axial position.  The saturated  ketone  function  must be located at C-14, in view of the low-field  absorption  of H-8. The coupling pattern  of this hydrogen  showed only one proton  in an anti relationship  and this  must be H-7cr (axial). Therefore,  the B/C ring junction  was  cis, with both H-8 and H-9 b-orientated.  In the ’ 3C NMR  spectrum  (Table 3) this arrangement  was reflected by the  high-field  position  of C-l 1, which was axial to ring B in  addition  to the gauche relationship  with C-l  (three y-  effects). Thus this compound  has structure  la.  Humirianthenolide  B (lb) had two more mass units  than  la and  was converted  to the  latter  by Jones  oxidation.  The stereochemistry  of the alcohol  function  was defined by the ‘H and i3C NMR spectral data. Thus,  the carbinolic  proton signal had splittings  consistent  with  an equatorial  hydroxyl  group  (Table  2). This  was  confirmed  by the invariance  of the C-12 absorption  and  the shelding of the C-7 by the gauche hydroxyl group. The  IR spectral data showed that the lactone carbonyl  of lb  had both  intra-  and inter-molecular  hydrogen  bonds  (with 3-OH and 14-OH, respectively,  giving a band at  1760cm-’  that  was  eliminated  by  conversion  to  derivative  le, which had no free hydroxyl groups). The fl-  arrangement  of the y-lactone  and hemiacetal  functions  was also indicated  by an alkaline hydrolysis  of lb, which  resulted  in a retro-aldol  reaction,  in agreement  with  previous observations  [2,3]. In our case, a 2: 1 mixture of  the isomers  5a and 5b, respectively,  was obtained.  The  characteristic  feature of the ‘H NMR spectrum  of these  compounds  was the splitting  of the methyl signal into a  Sa  Rt=H,R’=Me  Sh  R’ = Me, R2 = H  doublet, and therefore indicating  the presence of a 4-H. In  the major compound,  the signal of the latter proton was  not  split  further  than  a  quartet,  indicating  an  approximately  90” dihedral  angle with H-5. In the minor  product,  such  a coupling  existed  (7.5 Hz).  This  is  consistent  with the configurations  shown in formula  5.  Humirianthenolide  C (2a), with the same ring A and B  pattern as compound  1, had two additional  carbon atoms.

Humirianthenolide  D (3) had an enolized  a-diketone  system, as shown by IR (1670 and 1650 cm-‘),  UV (2%:”  272nm, E 10 500) and r3C NMR (three singlets at 6 192.8,  144.9 and 129.0). C-8 was part of this system. since one of  the hydrogens  on C-7 was strongly  deshielded  by the rt-  system  and its signal showed  only coupling  to H-6, in  addition  to the geminal  splitting.  The signals in the ‘H  and “CNMR  spectra  due to the A- and B-ring nuclei  were slightly changed in 3 relative to compounds  1 and 2.  A very diagnostic  feature was the shape ofthe H-6 signal, a  quartet  with three couplings  (to H-5, H-7a and H-7p) of  8 Hz. The sp* nature of C-8, a bridgehead  carbon, forces  ring B into a boat conformation,  with different  dihedral  angles between  its peripheral  protons.  H-9 remains  p-  orientated,  since  the alternative  configuration  would  entail more drastic changes,  e.g. a y-effect between  C-20  and C-11. Instead,  C-11 is deshielded  by the loss of a  gauche interaction  with C-7, now above the plane of the  boat-shaped  ring B.  Humiroanthenolide  E $a) was an isomer  of la and,  indeed, its IR spectrum  showed the presence of a saturated  ketone  (1700cm-‘).  However,  it differed from la in the  geometry  of rings B and C, H-6 being split by large  coupling  constants  by all its three  neighbours.  This  pattern was strongly  reminiscent  of the one described  for  3, suggesting  a trans junction  between rings B and C, and a  boat-like  ring  B, similar  to 3 where  C-8 was sp2-  hybridized.  One of the two protons  on C-7 absorbed  at  low-field (6 2.67), indicating  that the ketone was probably  located at C-14. The small coupling  between  this proton  and H-8 was in agreement  with a quasi-equatorial  and  axial positioning,  respectively,  for these  lwo  hydrogen  atoms.  Humirianthenohde  F (4b) had the same molecular  weight as lb and its molecular  ion in the MS lost two  molecules  of water, as was the case with lb (but not with  la or 4a, which lost only one water molecule),  indicating  the presence  of an hydroxyl  group  other than the one  located at C-3. The truns nature of the B/C ring junction  was determined  by the shape of the ‘H NMR signal of H-6  which was very similar to that in the spectrum  of4a. The  proton  spectrum  showed also a carbinolic  hydrogen  as a  multiplet  with WI/, = I Hz, which  was only consistent  with an axial secondary  alcohol.  Biogenetic  considera-  tions would suggest that the hydroxyl  is located at C-14.  The configurations  shown in formulae 14 are meant to  be relative. The fact that they also may represent  absolute  configurations  follows from the similarity  of the ORD  curve of lb (see Experimental)  and the ORD curves of  momilactones  A and B [3].  Only four diterpenoids  with the phenanthrene  skeleton  feature a frans-syn  stereochemistry,  i.e. with H-9 and C-20  in a cis relationship.  These  are annonalide  [3] and  momilactones  A, B [2] and C [4], all of which are A’  compounds.  This work, therefore,  constitutes  the first  example  of  diterpenoids  with  tran~~syn--cis  and  trans-syn-tram  arrangements.  While  the  former  stereochemistry  predominates  in  this  species,  an  interconversion  of the two forms by the enolization  ofa 14-  carbonyl  function,  as shown  in compound  3, could be  visualized.  The apparently  lower stability of the B/C tram  ringjunctionmay  bearesultofthe  boat-likeformsofring  B  that must be assumed  in these compounds.  The humirianthenolides  may derive from successive  oxidative  degradations  of a precursor  with an abietane  skeleton. This sequence could start with the removal ofone  of the methyls  of the isopropyl  side-chain,  leaving  a  carbonyl group in its place, as in compound  2a. Since this  product  contains  a masked  /I-diketone  functionality,  a  retro-aldol  reaction would lead to compounds  oxidized in  ring C only at C-14, such as I and 5.
