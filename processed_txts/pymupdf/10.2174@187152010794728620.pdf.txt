The mechanisms involved in the   observed cell growth arrest of the four most potent compounds were carried out by studying their effect in cell cycle profile and   programmed cell death. The results showed that one triterpene (odoratol) and two limonoids (gedunin and cedrelone) caused cell cycle  arrest while only the limonoids gedunin and cedrelone were found to be very potent inducers of apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION    Cancer represents one of the most severe health problems  worldwide and the development of new anticancer drugs and more  effective treatment strategies are fields of utmost importance in  drug discovery and clinical therapy. Based on significant advances  in cancer biology, much of the research in these areas is currently  focused on cancer-specific mechanisms and the corresponding mo- lecular targets [1].    Natural products have been the major sources of chemical di- versity driving pharmaceutical discovery over the past century.  Many natural products and synthetically modified natural product  derivatives have been successfully developed for clinical use to  treat human diseases in almost all therapeutic areas [2]. In fact,  plant-derived compounds have played an important role in treat- ment of cancers, and some of the most promising and effective  drugs have come up from plant sources like taxol®, camptothecin,  combrestatin, vinblastine and vincristine. These drugs have also  been the major source of new drug candidates for cancer chemo- therapy [3]. Apart from these, many other plant-derived compounds  are now in clinical trials as anticancer agents.     One of the most interesting groups of plant natural products is  the triterpenoid group. Over the past decade, coming to the fore- ground of interest due to their diverse biological effects are a large  group of cyclic triterpenoid-like substances which comprise more  than 4000 different identified compounds so far. Triterpenoids are  studied for their anti-inflammatory activity, hepatoprotective, anal- gesic, antimicrobial, antimicotic, virostatic, immunomodulatory and  tonic effects. They are used in prevention and treatment of hepatitis,  parasitic and protozoal infection and above all, for their cytotoxic  effects [4].     *Address correspondence to this author at CEQUIMED-UP - Centro de Estudos  de Química Medicinal, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, Rua  Aníbal Cunha 164, 4050-047 Porto, Portugal; Tel: (351) 222078916;   Fax: (351) 222003977; E-mail: madalena@ff.up.pt  §These authors equally contributed to this work    From a biological point of view, most important triterpenoid  structures are oleanane, ursane, lupane and dammarane triterpe- noids. However, in what concerns the anticancer effects, not many  triterpenoid compounds have been so far studied. Among these, the  lupane triterpene betulinic acid and the ursane triterpenes boswellic  acid and ursolic acid have been exhaustively studied for their anti- cancer effects.    Betulinic acid, which belongs to the lupane group, has been  investigated intensively for its anticancer activity. Betulinic acid  was found to exhibit the cytotoxic effects against human melanoma  cell lines MEL-1, 2 and 4 having the IC50 ranging from 0.5-1.6  �g/ml and dose dependent fragmentation of DNA with induction of  apoptosis occurred 24 hours after administration [5]. Cytotoxic  effects of betulinic acid were also found in other cell lines including  ovarian A2780, OVCAR-5, GROV-1, large cell lung cancer NCI- H460, epidermoid carcinoma A431, melanoma Me665/2/21, Me665/  2/60, small cell lung cancer POGB and POGB/DX (doxorubicin  resistant) with the IC50 values ranging from 1.5-4.5 �g/ml. How- ever, it showed lower toxicity to non-tumor cell lines such as  HDFC (normal dermal fibroblasts, IC50 = 10.2 ± 1.5 �g/ml) and  PBL (peripheral blood lymphocytes, IC50 = 50 �g/ml), in compari- son with doxorubicin (HDFC, IC50 = 0.38 �g/ml; PBL, IC50 =0.02  �g/ml). Interestingly, betulinic acid was markedly more effective  than cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristin and radiation on the primary  cancer cells isolated from glioblastoma multiforme [6]. It was  demonstrated also that one of the mechanisms underlying the  cytotoxic effect of betulinic acid and its derivatives was apoptosis  induction which was mediated by increasing permeability of the  mitochondrial membrane which disturbs the transmembrane  potential, causing the release of cytochrome-c and AIF (apoptosis  inducing factor), with the resulting activation of caspases 3 and 8.  Subsequent cleavage of the substrates and nuclear fragmentation  thus occurred  [7].  Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane  permeability by enhanced expression of Bcl-2 or BcL-xL proteins  suppresses activation of caspases and other markers of apoptosis   of neuroectodermal origin [8]. Furthermore, betulinic acid was  found to exert its cytotoxic effect against human glioma cell lines  770    Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10  Cazal et al.  (LN-229, U87, MG, T98G, LN-18 and LN-308) and an increased  level of the proapoptotic protein Bax was observed 24 hours after  treatment with betulinic acid. The induction of reactive oxygen  species (ROS), which are essential for activation of caspase 3, also   occurred [9]. On the other hand, clones of these cell lines express- ing high levels of Bcl-2, showed reduced ROS without activation of  betulinic acid induced apoptosis. These findings were in accordance  with the fact that the antiapoptotic properties of Bcl-2 are connected  with antioxidative defence mechanisms. This underlines the   importance of producing ROS in the induction of apoptosis by   betulinic acid. Betulinic acid is also an inhibitor of the enzyme  aminopeptidase N which takes part in the angioproliferative   and metastatic activity of tumors. From a clinical perspective, it is  interesting to point out that betulinic acid exhibits its greater effect  in an environment with a pH lower than 6.8, which is the case   for the majority of tumors [10]. Tellingly, in contrast to non-  cancer cells, cancer cells subjected to hypothermia showed   increased sensitivity to betulinic acid [11].     For the ursane group, boswellic acid and its derivatives were  found to be cytotoxic to glioma cell lines [12]. In animal model,  depending on dose, they caused an increased passage of cells to  apoptosis, inhibition of tumor growth and extension of survival  after implantation of cell lines of malignant glioma C6 [13]. Deriva- tives of boswellic acid were found to induce differentiation in leu- kemic cell lines in low concentrations and in high concentrations  they led to apoptosis [14]. The antiproliferative effects of these  derivatives are connected to their ability to inhibit both topoi- somerase I and II�, whose activity is critical for the proliferation of  cancer cells. Acetyl-11-keto-�-boswellic acid (AKBA), originally  isolated from Boswellia serrata, was found to inhibit constitutive  STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription-3) in  human multiple myeloma cells [15]. Activation of STAT3 has been  linked with survival, proliferation, chemoresistance and angiogene- sis of tumor cells, including human multiple myeloma. Thus, agents  that can suppress STAT3 activation have potential as cancer thera- peutics. Lipophilicity of boswellic acid derivatives allows them to  penetrate the blood-brain barrier and thus renders them the potential  for use in the treatment of malignancies of the CNS. Concerning  this, they were found to show higher inhibitory effects against  glioma cells than those of the clinically used anticancer agents  camptothecins [16] and etoposide [12]. Furthermore, derivatives of  boswellic acid are shown to be suitable for palliative treatment of  progressive or relapsing brain tumors, due to, among other things,  their anti-edematous properties [17]. Another interesting member of  the ursane group is ursolic acid, a ubiquitous triterpenoid in higher  plants. This compound was found to show inhibitory activity  against mammalian DNA polymerases � and �, and human DNA  topoisomerases I and II. It also inhibits bovine DNA polymerase �,  rat polymerase �, HIV reverse transcriptase. It was also found to  lower transcription of COX-2 by inhibition of the signal pathways  PKC and AP-1. As the expression of PKC and AP-1 is elevated in a  number of tumors, thus targeting these molecules is one of the aims  of antiproliferative therapy [18].     One of the most important members of the oleanane group is  oleanolic acid which is present in high concentration in the ginseng  root and it showed a range of antitumour effects. Oleanolic acid  was shown to induce differentiation in the teratocarcinoma cell line  F9 [19]. Furthermore, it was found to exhibit also antimutagenic  and antiangiogenic activities [20, 21]. In addition, it also stimulates  the release of NO and TNF-�, including induction of iNOS activity  and TNF-� expression in macrophages. This effect is mediated by  its ability to activate DNA binding to the transcription complex NF- �B and thereby its activation. Maslinic acid, another oleanane  triterpenoid which is present in high concentrations in the protective  wax-like coating of olives, was shown to exhibit inhibitory effects  on the growth of HT29 colon cancer cells [22]. Treatment with  maslinic acid resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation  in a dose-dependent manner and caused apoptotic death in colon- cancer cells. Mechanism study has revealed that maslinic acid in- hibited considerably the expression of Bcl-2 whilst increasing that  of Bax. It also stimulated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome-c  and activated caspases 9 and 3. Finally, for the dammarane group,  fomitellic acids A and B, the secondary metabolites of basidiomy- cete Fomitella fraxinea, were shown to inhibit mammalian DNA  polymerase � and �, and human DNA topoisomerase I and II.   It exhibited also cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines NUGC-3,   and PC-12 where differentiation was observed with subcytotoxic  concentrations [23].    In the course of our research program on isolation, synthesis  and evaluation of anticancer activity of plant natural products,   we have evaluated the capacity of two dammarane type triterpenes  (1 and 2), four tirucallane type triterpenes (3-6, Fig. 1) and eight                                   Fig. (1).

Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory   activity of the four most active compounds was also investigated  for their effects on the cell cycle profile and the programmed cell  death of the NCI-H460 cells.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  General Experimental    1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3, at ambient  temperature on a Bruker ARX 400 instrument operating at 400 and  80 MHz, respectively. The Shimadzu LC-6AD model HPLC  equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-6AV UV detector (240 and 215  nm) and a Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2Ga column (400 x 25 mm,  5�m particle size) was used. For column chromatography, Silica  gel 60 (Acros organics) and Sephadex LH 20 (Amersham Pharma- cia Biotech AB) were used. Solvents were from Synt and reagents  were from SIGMA, unless otherwise stated.   Extraction and Isolation of the Compounds  Isolation of Cabraleadiol (1) and Ocotillone (2)    Fruits of Cabralea canjerana (Vell.) Mart. was collected in  Federal University of Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The plant material was  identified by T.D. Pennington of the Royal Botanical Garden, Kew  (UK). A voucher specimen was deposited in the Herbarium of De- partamento de Engenharia Florestral, Dendrologia of the Federal  University of Viçosa.    After removing seeds, dried fruits (460g) were ground and ex- tracted with ethanol (3 x 500 mL), at room temperature and the  solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 88 g of a  concentrated ethanolic extract which was dissolved in 400 ml of a  3:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O. The aqueous methanolic solution was  partitioned successively with hexane (2x300 ml), CH2Cl2 (2x300  ml) and EtOAc (2x300 ml) to furnish hexane (47.4 g), dichloro- methane (5.4 g) and ethyl acetate (4.4 g) fractions. The hexane  fraction was applied over a silica gel column (250 g) and eluted  with hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, eight 700 ml fractions  were collected as follows: fr 1 (hexane), fr 2 (hexane- CH2Cl2, 1:1),  fr 3 ((hexane-CH2Cl2, 3:7), Fr 4 (hexane), fr 5 (CH2Cl2-EtOAc,  1:1), fr 6 (EtOAc), fr 7 (EtOAc-MeOH, 1:1), fr 8 (MeOH). Fr. 2  (120 mg) was placed on a gel permeation column of Sephadex LH- 20 (50 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of MeOH-CH2Cl2 to afford  three 250 ml subfractions. Subfr 2 (88.6 mg) was chromatographed  on a silica gel column (15 g) and eluted with a 1:1 mixture of hex- ane-Me2CO to give five 100 ml fractions. Frs 3 and 4, after evapo- ration of the solvent by reduced pressure, afforded, respectively,  24.4 mg of cabraleadiol (1) and 16.3 mg of ocotillone (2) whose  structures were established by 1H and 13C NMR as well as compari- son of their spectral and physical data with those reported in the  literature [24, 25].   Isolation of 7-Deacetoxy-7-Oxogedunin (7) and 6-Acetoxygedunin  (10)    Fruits of Carpa guianensis Aubl. were purchased from the city  of Belém (Pará State, Brazil). Dried and ground fruit aril (160g)  was extracted with MeOH (3 x 500 ml) at room temp. The metha- nolic solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to give 40 g  of the crude methanol extract which was dissolved in 150 ml of a  4:1 mixture of MeOH-H2O and then partitioned with hexane (3x  150 ml) and EtOAc (3x 150 ml) to give, respectively 23 g and 15 g  of hexane and ethyl acetate extracts. The ethyl acetate extract was                                              Fig. (2). Structure of limonoids (7-14) evaluated for growth inhibitory activity against three human tumour cell lines.

Purification of fr 8 by isocratic HPLC,  using a mixture of MeOH/ CH2Cl2 (7:3) as solvent and a UV detec- tion at 254 nm, yielded 32.1 mg of 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (7)  and 55.8 mg of 6-acetoxygedunin (10) whose structures were estab- lished by comparison of their 1H and 13CNMR data with those re- ported in the literature [26].   Preparation of Acetonide of Odoradol (5)    Odoratol (4, 25 mg) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of acetone and one  drop of conc.H2SO4 was added. The mixture was stirred at room  temperature, under N2 atmosphere, for 3 h after which the solution  was evaporated and the product was dissolved in ethyl acetate and  the solution was washed with H2O to remove H2SO4. Evaporation  of the solvent gave 15 mg of acetonide of odoratol (5).     Isolations of the tirucallane triterpenes odoratone (3), odoratol  (4), 22-hydroxytirucalla-7, 24-diene-2,3-dione (6) and the limon- oids gedunin (8) and 7-deacetoxygedunin (9) from Cedrela odorata  grafted on Toona cilata var. australis have been described previ- ously by de Paula et al. [27, 28]. Isolation and characterization of  the limonoids 6�-acetoxy-14�,15�-epoxyazadirone (11), cedrelone  (12), toonacilin (13) from Toona ciliata were described by Neto   et al. [29, 30] while isolation of guyanin (14) from Hortia oreadica,  was reported by Severino et al. [31].  Biological Activity   Reagents     RPMI-1640, foetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, phos- phate buffered saline (PBS) and trypsin were from Gibco Invitrogen  Co. (Scotland, UK). Acetic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),  ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), penicillin, streptomycin,  sulforhodamine B (SRB) and trypan blue were from Sigma Chemi- cal Co (Saint Louis, USA). Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and Tris  were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).   Solutions of Compounds     Stock solutions of compounds were prepared in DMSO and  kept at -20 ºC. Appropriate dilutions of the compounds were freshly  prepared just prior to each assay.   Cell Lines    Three human tumour cell lines, MCF-7 (breast adenocarci- noma, ECACC), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer, a kind gift  from NCI, Bethesda, USA) and A375-C5 (melanoma, ECACC)  were grown as a monolayer and routinely maintained in RPMI- 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM  glutamine and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 �g/ml strepto- mycin), at 37 ºC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.   Tumour Cell Growth Assay    The effect of the compounds on the growth of the described  human tumour cell lines was evaluated according to the procedure  adopted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) in the “In  vitro Anticancer Drug Discovery Screen”, which uses the protein- binding dye SRB to assess cell growth [32, 33]. The plating density  of each cell line was 1.5 x 105 cells/ml for MCF-7, and 7.5 x 104  cells/ml for NCI-H460 and A375-C5. Cells were allowed to attach  overnight in 96-well plates and were then exposed for 48 h to five  serial concentrations of the compounds, starting from a maximum  concentration of 150 μM (final concentration). At the end of this  incubation period the adherent cells were fixed in situ with 10%  TCA (final concentration), washed with distilled water and stained  with 0.4% SRB (solubilised in 1% acetic acid). The bound stain  was solubilised in 10 mM Tris and the absorbance was measured at  492 nm in a microplate reader (EAR400 STL-Labinstruments). For  each test compound and for each cell line a dose-response curve  was made and the value of GI50, corresponding to the concentration  of compound that inhibited 50% of the net cell growth, was calcu- lated as described elsewhere [33]. Doxorubicin, used as a positive  control, was tested in the same manner.  Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Profile and Levels of  Apoptosis in the NCI-H460 Cell Line    The compounds with GI50 bellow (or similar to) 10 �M were  selected for further analysis of their effect on cell cycle profile and  apoptosis. These assays were carried out in the NCI-H460 cells,  since they were one of the most sensitive cells to these compounds.  Cells were plated in 6-well plates (7.5�104 cells/ml) and incubated  at 37 ºC for 24 h, in order to adhere. Cells were then incubated for  48 h with complete medium (control), the compounds solvent  (DMSO) or with the compounds at their respective GI50 concentra- tions (determined by the SRB assay). Cells were then harvested and  further processed for cell cycle analysis and apoptosis detection.     For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and  subsequently resuspended in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A  and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cellular DNA content (for cell cycle  analysis and presence of sub-G1 peak) was then analyzed as previ- ously described [34], using an Epics XL-MCL Coulter flow cy- tometer, plotting at least 20,000 events per sample.     Apoptosis was analyzed using the Human Annexin V-FITC/PI  apoptosis Kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria), according to  the manufacturer’s instructions. Measurement of phosphatidylserine  externalization was processed using a flow cytometer plotting at  least 20,000 events per sample (as above).     Both cell cycle distribution and apoptosis data were analyzed  using the FlowJo 7.2 software (Tree Star, Inc.). At least three inde- pendent experiments were carried out and results are presented as  the average and standard error (SEM) of those experiments.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION    Six triterpenes (Fig. 1) and eight limonoids (Fig. 2) were evalu- ated for their ability to inhibit the in vitro growth of three human  tumour cell lines, namely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), non- small lung cancer (NCI-H460) and melanoma (A375-C5), using   the protein-binding dye sulforhodamine B (SRB) method and   their growth inhibitory effect, expressed as GI50 (�M), is shown in  Table 1.    Following a continuous exposure for 48 h, all six triterpenes (1- 6) and only four limonoids (8, 11, 12, 13) were found to be active  against all three tumour cell lines whereas the other four limonoids  (7, 9, 10 and 14) were inactive (Table 1). The tirucallane triterpene  odoradol (4) and the limonoids gedunin (8), 6�-acetoxy-14�,15� - epoxyazadirone (11) and cedrelone (12) showed strong cell growth  inhibitory activity, presenting their GI50 values below 12 �M for   all three cell lines. Interestingly, the limonoid cedrelone (12)   was found to be not only the most active growth inhibitor but also  more selective on NCI-H460 (GI50 = 2.77 ± 0.07�M) and A375-C5   (GI50 = 2.60 ± 0.21�M) cell lines when compared to odoradol (4),  gedunin (8) and 6�-acetoxy-14�,15�-epoxyazadirone (11). While  the dammarane cabraleadiol (1) showed moderate activity in all  three cell lines (GI50>30 �M), the tirucallane triterpenes odoratone  (3) and 22-hydroxytirucalla-7,24-dien-2,3-dione (6) showed moder- ate growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells  but strong activity against A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, the  dammarane triterpene ocotillone (2) showed only weak inhibitory  activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells but moderate activity  against A375-C5 cells whereas the limonoid toonacillin (13)  showed weak inhibitory activity against all three cell lines. Though  cabraleadiol (1) and ocotillone (2) are both 20, 24 – epoxydamma- rane, they differ only in the stereochemistry of C-24 and the func- tional group on C-3. With the C-24S configuration and the hydroxyl  Evaluation of Triterpenes and Limonoids on Human Tumour Cell Lines  Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10    773  group on C-3, cabraleadiol (1) exhibited ca. three times higher in  growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cells than  that of ocotillone (2) which has a ketone function on C-3 and the  opposite configuration of C-24. However, the growth inhibitory  effects on the A375-C5 cells are similar for both compounds. In  fact, cabraleadiol (1), isolated from various plant sources, has been  previously tested for its cytotoxicity against various tumour cell  lines. Phongmaykin et al. [35] reported a weak cytotoxic effect of  this compound, isolated from Chisocheton penduliflorus (Meli- aceae), on a breast cancer (BC) cell line. Qiu et al. [24] have found  no cytotoxic effect of cabraleadiol (1), isolated from Aglaia lawii,  on the LNcaP, Col 2 and KB cancer cell lines. On the other hand,  ocotillone (2), isolated from Betula platyphylla var. japonica, was  evaluated against a variety of human cancer cell lines, and was  found to show no cytotoxicity against the KB (human epidermoid  carcinoma of the nasopharynx), K562 (leukemia), MCF7 (breast  carcinoma), and COLO205 (colon carcinoma) cell lines. Interest- ingly, though ocotillone (2) did not exhibit any cytotoxicity against  KB-C2 (cochicine-resistant KB) cells (IC50 values >100 �M), it was  found to show moderate cytotoxic activity (with IC50 ranging from  20.6 to 64.2 �M) in the presence of 2.5 �M colchicine. The en- hanced cytotoxicity of ocotillone (2) against KB-C2 cells in the  presence of 2.5 �M colchicine as compared with that in the absence  of colchicine, suggesting that this triterpene might show some  MDR-reversing effects [25]. For the tirucallane triterpenes, odoratol  (4) was the most active analogue exhibiting GI50  values in the rank  of 10 �M. Replacing the hydroxyl group on C-3 of odoratol (4) by a  ketone group in odoratone (3) caused a two fold decrease of the  growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and NCI-H460 cell lines;  however this structural alteration did not affect the growth inhibi- tory activity against the A375-C5 cells. On the other hand, trans- forming the vic diol functionality on the furan ring of odoratol (4)  into its acetonide (5) led to a loss of activity.    Concerning the limonoids, the most active analogue was cedre- lone (12), exhibiting GI50 values below 5 �M in all three cell lines.  Although the capacity of cedrelone (12) to inhibit the in vitro  growth of human tumour cells have not been previously reported,  this compound is known to demonstrate several other activities  including insecticide [36], antifeedant [37] and antifungal activity  [38]. Although its growth inhibitory effect was ca. two folds less  than that of cedrelone, the structurally related limonoid 6�-acetoxy- 14�,15�-epoxyazadirone (11) also exhibited strong growth inhibi- tory activity against all three cancer cell lines. Interestingly,  Maneerat et al. [39] have found that 6�-acetoxyepoxyazadione,  isolated from Chisocheton siamensis and which differs from 11  only in the presence of the carbonyl group on C-16 of the former,  was inactive against oral human epidermal carcinoma (KB), small  cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) and breast cancer (MCF-7). Among  the limonoids whose structure possessing the lactone moiety on the  ring D, gedunin (8) was the only member which exhibited strong  growth inhibitory activity against all three human tumour cell lines  (GI50 �10 �M); however 7-deacetylgedunin (9) was inactive. Inter- estingly, Brandt et al. [40] have evaluated, among several ana- logues, gedunin (8) and 7-deacetylgedunin (9), obtained from neem  oils, for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 and SKBr-3  breast cancer cell lines. While gedunin (8) was found to exhibit  strong antiproliferative activity against both cell lines (IC50 =  8.84±0.03 for MCF-7 and 3.22± 0.6 for SKBr3), 7-deacetylgedunin  (9) showed only moderate activity (IC50 = 28.96±4.48 for MCF-7  and 21.09± 5.95 for SKBr3). Gedunin (8) was also shown to mani- fest anticancer activity via inhibition of the 90 kDa heat shock pro- tein (Hsp90) folding machinery [41] and to induce the degradation  of Hsp90-dependent client proteins similar to other Hsp90 inhibi- tors [42].    In order to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the  growth inhibitory activity of the most active compounds, they were  assayed for their effect on the cell cycle profile of the NCI-H460  cells. Thus, NCI-H460 cells were treated with odoratol (4), gedunin  (8), 6�-acetoxy-14�,15�-epoxyazadirone (11) and cedrelone (12) at  their respective GI50 concentrations (values of GI50 for NCI-H460  from Table 1) for 48 h and processed for cell cycle analysis. Results  (Fig. 3) show that the majority of the compounds tested (with the  exception of 11) affected the normal cell cycle distribution of the  NCI-H460 cells. Odoratol (4) was found to induce a cell cycle ar- Table 1.

Doxorubicin was used as positive control of the assay and the following GI50 values were obtained: MCF-7 = 42.8 ± 8.2 nM; NCI-H460 = 94.0 ± 8.7  nM;   A375-C5 = 79.5 ± 8.4 nM.  774    Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, Vol. 10, No. 10  Cazal et al.  rest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48% cells in this phase  upon DMSO treatment to 70% of cells following treatment with  this compound), causing a decrease in the % of cells in the S (from  29% in DMSO treatment to 13%) and G2M (from 21% in DMSO  treatment to 11%) phases of the cell cycle. Upon treatment with  gedunin (8), the cell cycle progression was blocked (arrested) in the  S phase (from 29% in DMSO treatment to 60%), leading to a de- crease in the % of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (from 48%  in DMSO treatment to 20%). Incubation with cedrelone (12) caused  an accumulation of cells (arrest) in the S (from 29% in DMSO  treatment to 40%) and the G2M (from 21% in DMSO treatment to  43%) phases of the cell cycle, with a concomitant decrease in the %  of cells in G1 (from 48% in DMSO treatment to 20%). In addition,  there were indications that odoratol (4), gedunin (8) and cedrelone  (12) induced apoptosis because of the increase in the sub-G1 popu- lation of cells when compared to control. Therefore, a specific  apoptosis assay was carried out.    Indeed, annexin-V-FITC/PI staining was performed to deter- mine the % of cells in early and late apoptosis (and necrosis) by  flow cytometry, following treatment of NCI-H460 cells with the  selected compounds. Results showed that for all tested compounds,  but very modestly for odoratol (4) and 6�-acetoxy-14�,15�- epoxyazadirone (11), the % of cells in early (annexin V positive, PI  negative) or late apoptosis (annexin V-positive, PI positive) were  increased upon treatment of cells with the GI50 concentration of the  compounds (Table 2). Gedunin (8) caused an increase in cell death  from approximately 12.6% in controls (or 11.2% in DMSO control)  to 47.2% in cells treated for 48 h with the GI50 concentration of this  compound. Indeed, cedrelone (12) was particularly effective in  inducing programmed cell death, causing 80.3% of cell death upon  48 h treatment of the cells with its GI50 concentration. It would be  interesting to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the  observed apoptotic inducing effects, particularly the effects on  caspase activation and PARP cleavage. In addition, the involvement  of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway could be investigated, by  analyzing the levels of Bax and other apoptosis related proteins,  such as Bcl-2 or BcL-xL. This would be possible by analyzing ex- tracts of cells treated with the compounds (with or without caspase  inhibitors) for the levels of apoptosis associated proteins, by West- ern Blot with appropriate antibodies, as has been carried out by  others for example in order to study the molecular mechanisms of  apoptosis induced by lupeol [43].  CONCLUSION    Six triterpenes (two dammaranes and four tirucallanes) and  eight limonoids, isolated from the members of the families Meli- aceae and Rutaceae, were evaluated by the SRB method for their  cytotoxic effect against three human tumour cell lines. The tirucal- lane triterpene odoratol (4) and the limonoids gedunin (8),   6�-acetoxy-14�,15�-epoxyazadirone (11), cedrelone (12) were the  most active inhibitors of cell growth (GI50 less than 12 μM). Of  these, cedrelone (12) has shown to be the most active growth in- hibitor, presenting GI50 values below 4.20 μM in all three tested  cell lines.    From the analysis of the cell cycle profile in NCI-H460 cells, it  was possible to conclude that odoratol (4) arrests cell cycle at the  G1 phase, gedunin (8) causes cell cycle arrest at the S phase and  cedrelone (12) at the S and G2M phases while 6�-acetoxy-14�,15�- epoxyazadirone (11) did not affect the cell cycle profile of these  cells. In addition, analysis of programmed cell death indicates that  odoratol (4) and 6�-acetoxy-14�,15�-epoxyazadirone (11) cause a  very small increase in cell death but gedunin (8) and particularly  cedrelone (12), are very potent inducers of programmed cell death.  In conclusion, cedrelone (12) is very potent by causing cell cycle                        Fig. (3).

It is evident from the number of recent studies that triterpenoid  compounds represent a promising and expanding platform for natu- ral anticancer agents whose potential is currently still not fully ex- ploited by pharmaceutical industry. As a number of recently studied  triterpenoids compare very favourably with drugs in current use  [44], it is foreseeable that attention of many research institutions  and pharmaceutical companies will be drawn to this class of com- pounds.
