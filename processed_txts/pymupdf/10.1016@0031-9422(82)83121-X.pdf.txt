Abstract-The  trunk  wood  of Licaria  chrysophylla  contains  rel-(7S,  8R, 1’S, 5’S)-A8’-3,3’S’-trimethoxy-4,5-  methylenedioxy-1’,4’,5’,6’-tetrahydro-4’-oxo-7.1’,8.0.2’-neolignan  (chrysophyllin  A), which differs  from all other  known  benzofuranoid  neolignans  by showing  7.1’ (rather  than  8.1’) and 8.02  (rather  than  7.0.2’) linkages  between  the propenylphenol  and allylphenol  derived  moieties.  The  trunk  wood  of Licariu  chrysophylla  gave a con-  siderable  proportion  of a novel  neolignan,  CZZH260,,  designated  chrysophyllin  A (la). The base peak of its  mass spectrum  (m/z 192) was assigned  to ion 2. If the  signals  due to such a molecular  unit are deleted  from  the ‘H and 13C NMR spectra,  all remaining  signals are  comparable  with the analogous  signals  of the cyclo-  hexenone  moiety  of  3’-methoxyporosin  (3a)  from  Anibu  ferrea  [2] (Table  1). Nomenclature  and num-  bering  of neolignans  follow  the rules  outlined  in a  recent  review  [6].  *Part LXVIII  in the series  “The  Chemistry  of Brazilian  Lauraceae”.  For Part LXVII  see ref. [l].  Such is the similarity  of the spectral  data that even  stereochemical  identity  can  be  assumed  to exist.  Thus,  the reciprocal  y-effect  between  C-5’ and C-7’  noted  for porosin  (3b) [5] is reproduced  by la which  must also bear H-5’ and the ally1 group in a cis relation-  ship. The sole significant  differences  in the spectra  refer  to the NMR signals of all ally1 protons,  which appear at  a consistently  higher field in la than in 3a and 3b, and  of the carbon  at position  6’, which  appears  at lower  field in la than in 3a and 3b. The signal of C-6’ of 3a  and 3b is located  at a relatively  high field due to the  protective  y-effect  of the cis-methyl  on C-8. Since no  such protection  of C-6’ occurs  in la, the existence  of  a tmns-methyl  could  be suspected.  In this case C-7’  Short Reports  2757  Table  1.

This also does not happen.  The chemical  shifts  for C-7’ of all three  compounds  are practically  identical  (6 39.420.4).  Thus  in com-  parison  with 3a and 3b, in la methyl  and aryl must be  interchanged.  The carbon  of position  1 of the aryl not  substituted  by hydrogen,  is not expected  to protect  significantly  either  C-6’ or C-7’. Indeed.  the presence  of the  aryl  group  in close  proximity  of the  ally1  protons  is the sole reasonable  explanation  for their  absorption  at relatively  high fields.  The  location  of the  aryl-methyl  substituents  at  interchanged  positions  is  confirmed  by  further  observations.  Double  irradiation  of H-8.  clearly  a  carbinolic  proton  (6 5.05), in la causes  the collapse  of  the methyl-doublet  (6 1.48) to a singlet;  and vice-  versa, irradiation  of H-9 causes  the change  of the H-8  multiplet  to a doublet  of J = 10.5 Hz. This coupling  constant,  much  larger  than  JH_T.H_X ( = 5 Hz) in the  porosins  (3a, 3b), as well as the chemical  shift of the  methyl  protons  (S  1.48). which  are  more  shielded  (&,,, = 0.5) in the  porosins,  points  to a trans-aryl-  methyl  relationship  in la. All other  possible  decoup-  ling  experiments  were  performed  and  led  to the  expected  results.  The presence  of a small amount  of chrysophyllin  B  (lb) in the extract  was detected  by ‘H NMR spectral  means.  The biosynthesis  of the porosin  type neolignans  (3)  was postulated  to involve  coupling  of the propenyl-  phenol  and the allylphenol  derived  radicals  4 and 5  [6]. By analogy,  the biosynthesis  of the chrysophyllin  type neolignans  would require  the coupling  of 4 with  the  2,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxyallylbenzene  derived  radical,  6. A biomimetic  synthesis  of a bicycio  (32.1)  octanoid  neolignan  with  the  aryl  and  methyl  sub-  stituents  at analogously  abnormal  positions  as in the  chrysophyllins  has been  achieved  by the concerted  [2 +4]  cycloaddition  of  (E)-isosafrole  to  a  2.3-  dimethoxy-6-hydroxyallylbenzene  derived  molecular  species  [7].
