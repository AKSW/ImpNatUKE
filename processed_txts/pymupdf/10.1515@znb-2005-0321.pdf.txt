Naturforsch. 60b, 351 – 355 (2005); received July 16, 2004 The fruits of Cipadessa fruticosa Bl. afforded two new limonoids: methyl 8α,30α-epoxide-3β- (2’-methylbutyryloxy)-1-oxomeliacate (cipadesin A) and methyl 21,23-dihydro-23-hydroxy-21-oxo- 3β-tigloyloxy-1-oxomeliac-8(30)-enate (febrifugin A), along with the known limonoids cipadesin, khayasin T, febrifugin, ruageanin A and mexicanolide. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods. Key words: Cipadessa fruticosa, Meliaceae, Limonoid, Cipadesin A, Febrifugin A Introduction Cipadessa fruticosa Bl. (Meliaceae) is widely cul- tivated in the southwest of China. This plant has been reported to contain ent-clerodanes and labdanes diter- penoids [1,2], limonoids, sterols, sesquiterpenoids, heneicosene derivatives and one coumarin [3, 4]. Flavonoid glycosides [5, 6] were isolated from C. cin- erascens and C. boivinina yielded sterols [7]. Limonoids are mainly found in plants belonging to the Meliaceae family. They have attracted consider- able interest because of their biological properties and variety of structures [8]. In this paper, we report the isolation of two new limonoids 1 and 2, along with ﬁve known limonoids: cipadesin (3) [3, 9], khayasin T (4) [10,3], febrifugin (5) [3, 9, 11,12], ruageanin A (6) [13] and mexicanolide (7) [14]. Results and Discussion The ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the dichloromethane extract of the fruits of C. fruti- cosa was puriﬁed by repeated column chromatography on silica gel and preparative HPLC to give the limonoids 1 – 7. Compound 1 had a molecular formula of C 32H42O9 as determined from the pseudo-molecular ion peak at m/z 593 [M + Na]+ in the positive ESI mass spectrum and elemental analysis. The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1 and 2) of 1 are similar to that cipadesin (3), a mexicanolide-type limonoid previously isolated from this plant [3]. They differed only with respect to an epoxide ring between C-8 and C-30 in 1 and the 0932–0776 / 05 / 0300–0351 $ 06.00 c⃝ 2005 Verlag der Zeitschrift f¨ur Naturforschung, T¨ubingen · http://znaturforsch.com oleﬁnic bond, in the same position, in 3. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 indicated the presence of four tertiary methyl groups (δH = 0.80, 0.82, 1.01 and 1.07), one methoxy singlet (δH = 3.72), three downﬁeld shifted signal attributed to a β-substituted furan ring (δH = 7.48, 7.43 and 6.46), two signals characteristic of pro- ton attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom (δH = 5.17, s, H-17 and δH = 5.10, d, J = 9.4 Hz, H-3) and the proton on the epoxide ring (δ H = 3.32, d, J = 2.4 Hz, H-30). The 13C NMR spectrum showed the presence of a ketone at δc = 214.3 (C-1) and three ester carbonyls at δc = 172.1 (C-16), 174.2 (C-7) and 175.9 (C-1’). In the 1H-1H COSY experiment the signal of H-30 showed cross peaks with the methine proton at δH = 3.56 (dd, J = 9.4, 2.4 Hz, H-2), which correlated with the signal of H-30. This signal showed HSQC cor- relation with the signal at δc = 63.5 attributed to C-30. In the HMBC spectrum, the signal at δc = 214.3 (C-1) showed correlations with the signals at δH = 1.07 (s, H-19, 3H), 3.32 (d, J = 2.4 Hz, H-30) and 3.56 (dd, 9.4, 2.4 Hz, H-2). It was observed long-range correlations of δH = 5.17 (s, H-17) with the signals at δc = 172.1 (C-16), 120.1 (C-20) and 26.7 (C-18), suggesting the presence of a δ-lactone as D-ring. The α-conﬁguration of epoxide ring at C8/C30 was deter- mined by the small coupling constant of H-30 (J = 2.4 Hz). The data above conﬁrmed that limonoid 1 had a mexicanolide skeleton. The 2-methylbutyryloxyl ester moiety at C-3 was characterized by the signals at δH = 2.58 (sextet, J = 6.8 Hz, H-2’); 1.55 and 1.79 (m, H-3’); 0.97 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, H-4’) and 1.25 (d, J = 7.0, H-5’) Unauthenticated Download Date | 10/9/15 10:32 AM 352 A.

The presence of this group in 1 was conﬁrmed by comparison of its spec- tral data with those published for swietenin E, iso- lated from Swietenia mahogoni [10]. Its β-orientation was deﬁned by the large coupling constant of H-3 (J = 9.4 Hz) [15]. Compound 1 was elucidated to be methyl 8α,30α-epoxide-3β-(2’-methylbutyryloxy)-1- oxomeliacate, named cipadesin A. Compound 2 showed the pseudo molecular ion peak at m/z 607 [M + Na]+, in the positive ESI mass spec- trum, according to the molecular formula C34H40O10, which was conﬁrmed by elemental analysis. Their 1H and 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1 and 2) indicated that it was also a mexicanolide-type limonoid. This compound is similar to febrifugin (5), previously iso- lated from Soymida febrifuga [11] and C. fruticosa [3], except for the group attached at C-17. The signals at δH = 5.30 (brd, J = 6.9 Hz, H-30) in the 1H NMR spectrum and the 13C NMR signals at δC = 137.9 (C-8) and 123.4 (C-30) are characteristics of the oleﬁnic linkage between C-8 and C-30 for limonoids with mexicanolide skeleton [16]. These attributions were conﬁrmed by the correlation of H-30 with the signal at δC = 123.4 (C-30) in the HSQC experiment. The tigloyl moiety at C-3 was deﬁned by the signals at δH = 6.92 (m, H-3’), which showed HSQC correla- tion with δC = 139.3 (C-3’), and two signals of methyl group at δH = 1.82 (dd, 6.9, 1.2 Hz) and 1.84 (t, 1.2 Hz) attributed to H-4’ and H-5’, respectively. The characteristic signals for a furan ring at C-17, typical for limonoids of Meliaceae, were not observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of 2. However, it showed two broad one-proton singlets at δH = 6.21 (H-23) and 7.34 (H-22), which showed cross peaks in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum. These 1H NMR sig- nals showed further couplings to a broad singlet at δH = 5.57, attributed to H-17. The 13C NMR data in- dicated the presence of a hemicetal carbon at δC = 97.0 (C-23), a α,β-unsaturated γ-lactone carbonyl at δC = 168.4 (C-21) and two signals at δC = 135.4 and 149.4, relating to the oleﬁnic bond at C-20/C-22. The HSQC experiment established the correlation of the signal at δH = 6.21 (brs, H-23) with δC = 97.0 (C-23) and δH = 7.34 (H-22) with the oleﬁnic car- bon at δC = 149.4 (C-22). The data above indicated the presence of a γ-hydroxybutenolide function in 2, which was conﬁrmed by the comparison with the limonoid 7-deoxo-7α-acetoxykihadanin B, previously Unauthenticated Download Date | 10/9/15 10:32 AM A.

The equilibrium between two epimeric forms at C-23 of this group ac- counts for the broadness of the 13C signal of C-23, C-22 and with a lesser intensity at C-20. The occur- rence of limonoids with γ-hydroxybutenolide at C-17 has already been reported in several members of the Meliaceae [17 – 20]. Compound 2 was characterized as methyl 21,23-dihydro-23-hydroxy-21-oxo-3β-tigloyl- oxy-1-oxomeliac-8(30)- enate, named febrifugin A. Compound 3 showed spectral data identical to those published for cipadesin (3) [3]. However, the signal earlier reported to C-12/C-15 were inverted. These 13C NMR signals were reassigned as shown in Ta- ble 2. The data reported to febrifugin (5) [11,12] also presented mistaken. The 13C NMR signals previously attributed to C-2, C-5, C-9, C-12, C-14, C-15, C-21 and C-23 were inconsistent with those observed to compound 5 (Table 2). These corrections were based on the 1H and 13C NMR, 1H-1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC experiments of compounds 3 and 5 and con- Table 2. 13C NMR spectral data for compounds 1 – 3 and 5 in CDCl3 (100 MHz, CDCl3).

The mexicanolide-type limonoids 4, 6 and 7 were elucidated to be khayasin T [10], ruageanin A [13] and mexicanolide [14], respectively. It was possi- ble through the comparison of their one and two- dimensional NMR spectral data with those previously reported to them. Harms [21] classiﬁed the meliaceous genera into three subfamilies Cedreloideae, Swietenioideae and Melioideae (tribes Carapeae, Melieae, Turraeeae, Vavaeeae and Trichilieae). Pennington and Styles [22], in their more recent monograph, included Harms’ subfamily Cedreloideae, tribe Carapeae into the Swi- etenoideae and removed genus Cipadessa from Tur- raeeae classifying it in Trichilieae.

The Melioideae appears to be the most proliﬁc in pro- duction of A,B-seco limonoids but relatively poor in mexicanolide types [23, 24]. The latter group of com- pounds has been recorded in genera of the Harms’ tribe Trichilieae. Thus, the present results obtained from Cipadessa fruticosa and those from literature [3], provide ﬁrm support for including Cipadessa in the Trichilieae.

Plant material The fruits of Cipadessa fruticosa Bl. were collected in Vic¸osa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and a voucher specimen (110.664) was deposited in the SPF Herbarium of Instituto de Cincias Biol´ogicas-USP, S˜ao Paulo, Brazil. Extraction and isolation of compounds The powdered air-dried fruits (990 g) of C. fruticosa were subsequently extracted with hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH. The conc. CH2Cl2 extract (10.9 g) was submitted to vac- uum chromatography over silica gel using a hexane-CH2Cl2- EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate-soluble fraction (2.3 g), rich in limonoids, was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with a hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone gradient to give 8 fractions (A-H). Fraction C was fractionated as above, using hexane-EtOAc gradient, affording 11 fractions. Frac- tion C-6 was twice chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1) to give compounds 1 (8.5 mg) and 3 (19.4 mg). Fraction D was chromatographed as above, using hexane-EtOAc gradient, to afford 4 fractions. Fraction D-3 was twice chromatographed with a hexane- CH2Cl2-acetone gradient yielding a fraction containing com- pounds 6 and 7, which was puriﬁed by HPLC (detection UV λ 220 nm), using hexane-iso-PrOH (85:15) with a ﬂow rate of 1.5 ml min−1 to yield 6 (9.3 mg) and 7 (12.4 mg). Frac- tion E was twice subjected to column chromatography over silica gel, eluting with a hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone gradient affording 4 fractions. Fraction E-3 was puriﬁed by HPLC (detection UV λ 240 nm), using hexane-iso-PrOH (8:2) at 2.0 ml min−1 to give 2 (4.7 mg) and 5 (40.3 mg).
