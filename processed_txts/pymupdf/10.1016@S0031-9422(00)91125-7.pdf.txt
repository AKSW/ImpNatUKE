The alcoholic extract of the roots of Curissa  carundus L. has been reported to possess cardio-  tonic activity [l] and to produce a perceptible de-  crease in blood pressure in normal anaesthetized  cats [2]. Chemical studies have led to the isola-  tion of possibly a new cardioactive substance [3];  glucosides of odoroside  H [4]. a new terpenoid  carindone [S] besides carissone,  lupeol,  ursolic  acid and its methyl ester [6]. A recent investiga-  tion of the pharmacological  activity [7] of the  extract showed an increase in free histamine in  the guinea pig lung and a pronounced  decrease  in blood pressure at 1 mg/kg dose which lasted  * CDRI Communication  No. 2024.  for 4-5 hr. On fractionation  of the extract, the  hypotensive activity was found to be localized in  the  C,H,-soluble  fraction  which  prompted  further examination  of its constituents.  The active fraction was fractionated  into Et10  and CHCl,  soluble and insoluble fractions and  the activity was now found to be present in the  CHCl,-insoluble  fraction. It showed one major  spot R, 038 in CHCI,-EtOAc  (1:4) (TLC), and  was chromatographed  over Si gel which led to  the isolation of the substance corresponding  to  the above spot as an amorphous  powder. named  “carinol”.
