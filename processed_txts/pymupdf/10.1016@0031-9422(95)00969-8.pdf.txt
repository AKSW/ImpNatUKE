Abstract--The hexane extract of leaves of Trichilia claussenii yielded the new triterpenoid 24-methylene-26-  hydroxycycloartan-3-one, 24-methylenecycloartanol fatty acids derivatives, caryophyllene epoxide, a mixture of  to-phenyl alkanoic and alkenoic acids, plastocromenol, ct-tocopherol, squalene, and a mixture of sitosterol and  stigmasterol as free alcohols and esterified by fatty acids. The methanol extract afforded N-methyl-proline, 4-  hydroxy-N-methylproline, ~o-phenyl alkanoic acids and a mixture of/3-O-D-glucopyranosides of sitosterol and  stigmasterol.  INTRODUCTION  Plants of the Meliaceae family have been used to  control insect pests. The C-seco-limonoids have been  shown to have good antifeedant activities. Azadirachtin,  belonging to this group, is the most potent antifeedant  [1]. These limonoids appear to be restricted to Melia  and Azadirachta species, but heudebolin, a typical  member of the group, was found in the bark of Trichilia  heudelotti [2]. However, it has to be said that there is  the possibility that extracts were confused during  processing [2]. Clearly, much more detailed phyto-  chemical investigations of Trichilia species will be  essential. Thus, our interest in antifeedant compounds  and particularly our taxonomic interest in the Meliaceae  stimulated an investigation of other Brazilian plants of  the Trichilia genus [3]. In this paper we report a  phytochemical study on the leaves of T. claussenii DC.,  which grows in S~o Paulo State, Brazil.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The leaves of T. claussenii were percolated with  hexane, methylene chloride and methanol, respectively.  The hexane extract after chromatography gave some  terpenoids and oJ-phenyl alkanoic acids. Compound 1  appeared to be a cycloartane triterpenoid. Its IR spec-  trum showed absorption due to a ketonic carbonyl  (1695 cm -~) and a hydroxyl (3557 cm-l). In the mass  spectrum the parent ion observed, mlz 424, does not  *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.  represent the molecular ion which is expected to be m/z  454. This means that a McLafferty type rearrangement  occurred in the side chain with the loss of a fragment  mlz 30. Its 'H NMR spectrum showed a shielded AB  system (8 0.55 and 0.76, both d, J = 4.4 Hz) arising  from to two cyclopropane protons; a doublet of doub-  lets of doublets (8 2.29, J = 2.8, 4.4 and 14.0 Hz) for  H-2a; a triplet of doublets (8 2.68, J = 6.4, 13.6 and  13.6 Hz) for H-2fl; a septet (8 2.34, J = 6.8 Hz) for  H-25; two superimposed doublet of doublets (8 3.49,  J--7.2 and 10.8 Hz; 8 3.51, J = 6.4 and 10.6 Hz) for  H-26; a broad singlet (8 4.79) and a broad doublet (8  4.86), both attributed to H-31 in the side chain. Based  on the ~H-~H COSY spectrum it was also possible to  assign the doublets (8 0.88, J = 6.0 Hz) to Me-21 and (8  1.02, d, J= 6.8 Hz) to Me-27. This spectrum also  showed correlation between H-26 and H-25, H-2/3 and  H-2a besides H-19a with H-19b. Compound 1 was  acetylated, yielding the corresponding monoacetate (la)  whose ~H-~H COSY spectrum permitted the assign-  ment of all the chemical shifts for the protons in the  side chain. The attribution of chemical shifts for the  carbons in the side chain of la was achieved by  comparison with a model compound from the literature  [4]. It seems that this is the first time that compound 1  has been described in the literature.  Compound 2 was also identified as a cycloartane  derivative, with a fatty acid esterifying the alcohol at  C-3. After hydrolysis of 2 under basic conditions, an  alcohol 2a and a mixture of acids were obtained. The  acids, after esterification with diazometh/me and GC-  mass spectral analysis, were identified as a mixture of  methyl esters of fatty acids ranging from C-14 to C-26.  795  796  M.T.

Compound 2a was shown to  be 24-methylenecycloartan-3fl-ol on the basis of its ~H  NMR spectrum, which revealed two broad singlets (6  4.72 and 4.66; 2H-31); a doublet of doublets (6 3.28,  J = 11.0 and 4.0 Hz, H-3); a heptet (6 2.24; J = 6.8 Hz;  H-25); two doublets (6 0.55 and 0.33, 2H-19). Me-26  and Me-27 appeared as two doublets (6 1.03 and 1.02,  J = 6.8 Hz) and Me-21 as a doublet (6 0.9, J = 6.0 Hz).  Compound 2 had already been described and its  spectral data match with those described in the litera-  ture [5].  The w-phenyl alkanoic acids (3) were identified in  mixture through GC-mass spectral analysis and NMR  after esterification with diazomethane. The ~H NMR  spectrum showed signals of an aromatic ring (6 7.14-  7.28); a broad triplet (6 5.34, J= 5.2Hz), due to  olefinic protons of the fatty acids with a double bond in  the side chain; two triplets (6 2.59, J = 7.6 Hz, and 6  2.29, J= 7.6Hz) attributable to the benzyl and a-  carbonyl protons respectively; a singlet (6 3.65  OH  ~  . , l l l l l   4  CO2Me), and a series of signals (8 1.0-2.0) for the  methylene protons in the side chain. The 13C NMR of 3  confirmed the presence of an ester carbonyl as well as  an aromatic ring and a double bond in the side chain.  Analysis of the methyl esters of 3 by GC-mass spec-  trometry allowed us to identify and establish the ratios  of each acid in the mixture as" to-phenyl decanoic (3a,  1.12%), w-phenyl undecanoic (3b, 2.45%), to-phenyl  dodecanoic (3c, 36.03%), to-phenyi tridecanoic (3d,  39.95%), w-phenyl tetradecanoic (3e, 3.49%) and ~o-  phenyl pentadecanoic (3f, 3.04%). The corresponding  alkenoic acids containing 14 (3g, 3.30%) and 15 (3h,  6.15%) carbon atoms were also identified, though the  position of the double bond was not established.  N-Methylproline and 4- hydroxy-N-methylproline  were identified mainly on the basis of their ]H and ~3C  NMR spectra through comparison with the literature  [6]. Both compounds were methylated with diazometh-  ane to yield the corresponding N-dimethyl derivatives.  Caryophyllene epoxide was also isolated [7].  The w-phenyl alkanoic acids can be biosynthesized  Cycloartane triterpenoid from Trichilia claussenii  797  through direct condensation of C6-C 3 units with  polyketide chains of different lengths. Grandinolides  and other related compounds were known until recently  to occur only in the Myristicaceae and Lauraceae  families [8]. However, the grandinolide (4) was isolated  from T. schomburgkii [9]. It has been proposed that the  biosynthesis of the lactone compounds requires con-  densation of either a cinnamoyl or benzoyl moiety with  a polyketide chain, and subsequent condensation with  pyruvic acid [8]. Therefore, the isolation of 3 seems to  be good evidence for this biosynthetic proposal. As far  as we know this is the first report of to-phenyl alkanoic  acids from plants. However, to-cyclohexyl and to-  cycloheptyl fatty acids have been isolated from the  lipids  of  the  thermoacidophile  Alicyclobacillus  acidocaldarius and A. cycloheptanycus [10]. The bio-  synthesis proposed for these compounds is based  exclusively on the polyketide pathway.  EXPERIMENTAL  General. IR: KBr. IH and ~3C NMR spectra were  recorded at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, in CDC13  with TMS as int. standard. GC-MS: low resolution on a  HP-2576 instrument.  Isolation of constituents. Leaves of T. claussenii  were collected in Rio Claro, SP, Brazil, and a voucher  is deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de  Bioci~ncias, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro,  SP, Brazil. The leaves were dried, powdered and  extracted with hexane, CH2C12 and MeOH. The hexane  extract (28.7 g) was submitted to vacuum chromatog-  raphy over silica gel using hexane, CH2C12, EtOAc and  MeOH. The hexane fr. was chromatographed over  silica  gel using hexane-EtOAc (19:1), yielding  caryophyllene epoxide (14.9mg). Chromatography of  the CH2C12 fr. over silica gel using hexane-EtOAc  (99: 1) followed by prep. TLC (hexane-EtOAc, 9: 1),  yielded plastocromenol (30.0 mg) and a mixt. of ter-  penoid fatty acid derivatives. This mixt., after hy-  drolysis with alcoholic KOH and flash chromatography  using hexane-EtOAc  (9: 1),  afforded 24-methyl-  enecycloartanol (2b) (10.0mg), and a mixt. of sitos-  terol and stigmasterol. The fatty acids obtained from  hydrolysis were esterified with CH2N 2 and analysed by  GC-MS. The EtOAc fr. was flash chromatographed  over silica gel using hexane-EtOAc (9: 1) followed by  chromatography over florisil using hexane-EtOAc  (4: 1), yielding 24-methylene-26-hydroxycycloartan-3-  one (1) (51.0mg). Compound 1 was acetylated with  acetic anhydride and pyridine to yield the monoacetate  (la). Chromatography of the last fr. of the EtOAc fr.,  firstly, over silica gel using hexane-EtOAc (4:1) and  then over silica gel (flash) using hexane-Me2CO  (99: 1), yielded a mixt. of to-phenyl alkanoic and  alkenoic acids (3) (80.0 mg), which was esterified with  CH2N 2 and analysed by GC-MS. From the CH2C12  extract using a similar procedure as above it was  possible to isolate 1. The MeOH extract (19.9 g) was  suspended in MeOH-H20 (1:3) and partitioned with  CH2C12-EtOAc-n-BuOH. The CH2C12 fr. was concd  and then partitioned with hexane-MeOH. The MeOH  fr. was chromatographed on a DCCC column (CHCI 3-  MeOH-H20), 5:5:3, ascending method). This led to  the isolation of a mixt. of sitosterol and stigmasterol  glycosides. The last ft. eluted afforded, after flash  chromatography over silica gel using Me2CO-H20  (4:1), the amino acids N-methylproline (66.4 mg) and  4-hydroxy-Nmethylproline (120.3 mg).  24-Methylene-26-hydroxycycloartan-3-one (1) Amor  phous solid, mp 138-140 °, [or] D +18.7 ° (CHC13, c  0.05), EIMS mlz (tel. int.): 424 [M-CH20] + (39), 355  (21), 313 (39), 271 (14), 201 (22), 147 (48), 107 (68),  95 (92), 91 (58), 55 (100). 13C NMR (CDCI3): 8 216.8  (s, C-3), 152.0 (s, C-24), 109.5 (t, C-31), 65.8 (t, C-26),  52.2 (d, C-17), 50.2 (s, C-4), 48.7 (d, C-5), 48.4 (s,  C-14), 47.9 (d, C-8), 45.3 (s, C-13), 42.5 (d, C-25),  37.5 (t, C-2), 36.1 (d, C-20), 35.5 (t, C-12), 34.0 (t,  C-23), 33.4 (t, C-l), 32.8 (t, C-15), 31.2 (t, C-22), 29.5  (t, C-19), 28.1 (t, C-7), 26.7 (t, C-16), 25.9 (t, C-11),  25.8 (s, C-10), 22.2 (q, C-29), 21.5 (t, C-6), 21.0 (s,  C-9), 20.8 (q, C-30), 19.3 (q, C-28), 18.3 (q, C-21),  18.1 (q, C-18), 16.4 (q, C-27).
