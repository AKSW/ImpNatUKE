The extract (40 g) was chromatographed  on silica. Elution  with  light petrol. gave safrol (12 ml). Elution  with light petrol.-benzene,  1: 1 gave first sitosterol  (350 mg) and next eugenol  (8 ml). Elution  with benzene  gave 3,6methylenedioxycinnam-  aldehyde  (200 mg, m.p. 84-85”, lit.6 m.p. 84-85’).  Elution  with benzene-AcOEt  4: 1 gave  first 3,Cmethylenedioxycinnamyl  alcohol  (80 mg, m.p. 75-77”, lit.7 m.p., which we were  not able to confirm,  123”) and next syringic  aldehyde  (120 mg, m.p. 108-IlO”,  lit.’ m.p.  109-l 10’). The identifications  were obtained  by spectral  means  and confirmed  by direct  comparison  with authentic  samples.  Comments. Surprisingly  3,4-methylenedioxycinnamyl  alcohol  and 3,4-methylenedioxy-  cinnamaldehyde  seem to be rare natural  products.  While the proven  occurrence  of the  aldehyde  was so far restricted  to two Lauraceae  (camphor  tree,9 sassafras6),  the alcohol  does not seem to have been isolated  previously.  6 M. HIKE and R.
