Gottlieb on this 85th birthday  (received 19 Apr 04; accepted 06 July 04; published on the web 18 July 04)    Abstract  The roots of Toona ciliata yielded four new 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes which were identified on  the basis of spectroscopic analysis as 9,10-dihydro-9-hydroxy-9-(tert-butoxycarbonylmethyl)- 10-oxophenanthrene,  9,10-dihydro-9-hydroxy-9-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-10-oxophenanthrene,  9,10-dihydro-9-hydroxy-9-(n-butoxycarbonylmethyl)-10-oxophenanthrene and 9,10-dihydro-9- hydroxy-9-(benzyloxycarbonylmethyl)-10-oxophe-nanthrene. These compounds represent a  novel group of phenanthrenes lacking oxygen in the benzene rings. In addition the known  limonoid cedrelone, the sterols sitosterol and stigmasterol, the coumarins isopimpinellin and  siderin, the furoquinoline alkaloid skimmianine and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamaldehyde were  also isolated and characterized.    Keywords: Toona ciliate, Meliaceae, 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes, limonoid, biochemical  systematics        Introduction    The genus Toona (Endlicher) M. J. Roemer contains approximately six poorly defined species  which occur in the old world eastwards from Indian to Australia.1 Phytochemical data are  available for T. sureni (Blume) Merril. and T. ciliata M. J. Roem. The latter has been the more  widely investigated and is a major source of ring-B-seco limonoids.2-7 Furthermore, it produces  sesquiterpenes of the cadinene group,8,9 α- and β- amyrins acylated with fatty acids,5 simple  coumarins5 and proanthocyanidins.10 The constituents of T. sureni are so far four limonoids with  intact carbon squeleton11 and ring-A/ring-B dilactones.12 Toona was originally described by  Issue in Honor of Prof. Otto Gottlieb  ARKIVOC 2004 (vi) 45-53  ISSN 1424-6376  Page 46  ©ARKAT USA, Inc  Endlicher1 as a section of Cedrela. However, Roemer later recognized that they could be  separated by a number of sound morphological characters, raising Toona to generic rank.1 The  known limonoids from Cedrela are mainly mexicanolides.5 Thus, the total lack of mexicanolides  in all aerial parts of T. ciliata strongly supports Roemer’s taxonomic conclusions. We have now  examined the roots since they have never been investigated before and in order to determine if  the above differences still remain also in this organ.      Results and Discussion    The dichloromethane extract from the roots of exotic T. ciliata, afforded the limonoid cedrelone,5  the sterols sitosterol and stigmatesrol, the coumarins isopimpinellin and siderin,5 the  furoquinoline alkaloid skimmianine, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamaldehyde and four 9,10- dihydrophenanthrenes 1-4 (Figure 1).    2' 1' 10 8 7 6 5a 5 1a 4a 4 3 2 9 8a 1 O HO RO O O O 5           1: R =  C(CH3)3 ;   2: R = CH2CH3         3: R =  CH2CH2CH2CH3 ;   4: R = CH2Ph      1'' 1'' 2'' 1'' 4'' 1''   Figure 1    The major compound was identified as 1 on the basis of the following data. EI mass  spectrometry gave [M]+ as C20H20O4 and the IR spectrum indicated carbonyl, ester carbonyl, and  hydroxyl functional groups. The 1H NMR spectrum run in C6D6 (Table 1) was better resolved  than in CDCl3 and showed signals integrating for eight aromatic protons. The 1H-1H COSY and  homonuclear decoupling experiments suggested the presence of two ortho disubstituted phenyl  rings. One ring was established by the four mutually-coupled proton system at δ 7.88 (ddd, J =  7.4, 1.6, 0.4 Hz), 7.06 (td, J = 7.4, 1.4 Hz), 7.02 (td, J = 7.4, 1.6 Hz), 7.36 (ddd, J = 7.4, 1.4, 0.4  Hz).

This  was supported by the HMBC experiments (see Experimental) which showed correlations  between this latter proton signal and the 13C signal at δ 201.9 (3J). The 1H signal at δ 6.93 was  ortho-coupled to the H-1 signal and showed a cross peak with the singlet resonance at δ 129.8  (J3), thus these signals can be attributed to H-2 and C-1a adjacent to the ketonic carbonyl group  (δ 201.9), respectively. The proton signal at δ 7.37 was para-coupled to the H-1 signal (then  assigned to H-4) and showed long-range correlation with the 13C signal at δ 129.7. The 1H signal  at δ 7.36 belonging to another phenyl ring, also showed long-range correlation with the 13C  signal at δ 129.7. If the latter signal was assigned to a carbon belonging to the second ring and  shows cross peaks by 3J with the H-4, both rings must be bound to each other. Thus, the above  correlations permitted the assignments of H-5 at δ 7.36 and C-5a at δ 129.7. Furthermore, the  observed correlations between the quaternary oxygen-bearing carbon at δ 78.2 and the 1H signal  at δ 7.88, which was para-coupled to the H-5, indicated a quaternary benzyl alcohol to be located  at C-8a and led to their assignments as C-9 and H-8, respectively. The 1H NMR also showed one  isolated AB-type methylene at δ 2.62 and 2.72. The correlation from the latter signal to the C-9  signal and to two carbonyl signals at δ 201.9 and 167.8, resulted in the construction of an  atypical 9,10-dihydro-9-hydroxy-9-(alkoylcarbonylmethyl)-10-oxophenanthrene system, lacking  oxygen in the benzene rings. A tert-butoxide group must be connected at carbonyl carbon due to  the observed correlation between a singlet at δ 1.28 (9H, assigned to three magnetically  equivalent methyl groups) and the 13C signal at δ 81.0. The large geminal coupling constant of  the methylene protons was consistent with C-9 fully substituted. The identification of the nucleus  as a 9-hydroxy-10-oxophenanthrene was also supported by the mass spectrum which gave a  significant fragment at m/z 209 (Scheme 1) due to fission of the side chain between C-1' and C-9.  The structure of the new natural product was thus established as 9,10-dihydro-9-hydroxy-9-(tert- butoxycarbonylmethyl)-10-oxophenanthrene (1).

The 1H NMR spectrum,  instead of signals for a tert-butoxide group, showed signals for a methyl triplet (δ 0.84, J = 7.2)  and 1H resonances for an AB system associated with a methylene group whose hydrogens were  not equivalent and each make up an AB doublet (J = 18.4) further split by additional coupling  with the methyl-hidrogens (J = 7.2). A significant fragment at m/z 89 [CH3COOCH2CH3 + H] in  the mass spectrum for 2, associated with retro-aldol cleavage of side-chain, clearly indicated the  presence of a carboethoxy group at C-1' (Scheme 1). Thus, compound 2 was concluded to be  9,10-dihydro-9-hydroxy-9-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-10-oxophenanthrene. Compounds 1 and 2  Issue in Honor of Prof. Otto Gottlieb  ARKIVOC 2004 (vi) 45-53  ISSN 1424-6376  Page 50  ©ARKAT USA, Inc  have already been known as a reaction product obtained from phenanthrenequinone (5),14-16  however, this the first time that they have been isolated as natural products.  Compound 3 was isolated in very small amounts and could not be separated from 2. This  mixture gave rise to a mass spectrum which indicated a molecular formula C20H20O4 ([M+H]+ =  325) for 3, suggesting an isomer of 1. Analysis of the 1H NMR, which in addition to signals  described above for 2 showed a broad quintet at δ 1.53 and a broad sextet at δ 1.30, together with  the signals at δ 64.9 (C-1''), 30.4 (C-2''), 19.1 (C-3'') and 13.7 (C-4'') in the 13C NMR, indicated  the alcohol portion to be n-butyl. Moreover, the chemical shifts of n-butyl carbons were  comparable with those reported for O-alkyl group in n-butyl ethanoate (δ 63.1, 30.4, 18.6 and  12.7).17 In addition, compound 3 did not give a significant fragment at m/z 57 as in 1, the ion  observed being m/z 117 for [CH3COOCH2CH2CH2CH3 + H]+. These data were consistent with  the structure of 9,10-dihydro-9-hydroxy-9-(n-butoxycarbonylmethyl)-10-oxophenanthrene for 3.  Compound 4 also showed the spectral characteristics of a 9,10-dihydro-9-hydroxy-9- (alkoylcarbonylmethyl)-10-oxophenanthrene system. The mass spectrum gave significant  fragments for m/z 107 and 91 (Scheme 1) requiring the presence of a benzyloxyl group. The 1H  NMR spectrum of 4 (Table 1) revealed that the phenanthrene rings resonances remain essentially  unchanged. However, eight protons occurred as a complex multiplet between δ 6.99 and 7.10,  three of which belonged to H-3 (δ 7.08 dt), H-6 (δ 7.02 dt) and H-7 (δ 7.05 m) and the other five  (δ 7.05-7.08 m; 3''-7'') clearly indicated the unsubstituted nature of the benzyloxyl group. The  indication of the alcohol portion of the new ester received further support from the 13C NMR  spectrum (Table 2) which showed close agreement with published data for this group in 2'- hydroxy-4',6',3-trimethoxy-4-benzyloxychalcone.18 Therefore, the structure of 4 was assumed to  be 9,10-dihydro-9-hydroxy-9-(benzyloxycarbonylmethyl)-10-oxophenanthrene.  This appears to be the first record of phenanthrenes from Meliaceae or from the allied  families of the order Rutales (Rutaceae, Meliaceae, Simaroubaceae and Cneoraceae). In addition,  these compounds represent a novel group of unsubstituted phenanthrenes. Oxidation involving  phenyl rings, as hydroxyl and methoxyl substituents, has been found in Orchidaceae.13 It can of  course be argued that the roots were collected with a trace of other roots which do not belong to  T. ciliata. However, subsequent to this work we ourselves have found these compounds in stock  of a 5-year-old tree of C. odorata grafted on T. ciliata.19 Indeed the sporadic occurrence of  particular micromolecular types in unrelated taxa is a general phenomenon.20      Experimental Section    General Procedures.

Isolation of compounds. The roots were dried, powdered (1050 g) and extracted with hexane,  then CH2Cl2, MeOH and finally with H2O. Preliminary examination of the two first extracts  using TLC (silica gel) showed each to contain the same range of compounds, so they were  combined (418.3 mg). During concentration of the combined extracts a crystalline material  separated which was collected and crystallised from MeOH to give cedrelone as colourless  prisms (37.5 mg). The concd hexane-CH2Cl2 extract was flash chromatographed on silica gel  eluting with a hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH gradient affording a mixture of sterols and 7 frs. The  mixture of sterols was analysed by GC-mass spectrometry, which established that the sterols  were sitosterol and stigmasterol. Fr. 2 yielded, after crystallization in MeOH, siderin as  colourless needles (10.3 mg).
