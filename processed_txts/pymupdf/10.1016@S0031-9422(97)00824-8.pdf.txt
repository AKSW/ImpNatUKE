Abstract--Two new sesquiterpene evoninate alkaloids, were isolated together with the known compounds  syringaresinol and 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin from the root bark ofMaytenus aquiJolium. The structures  of the two alkaloids were elucidated by interpretation of their spectral data, and both exhibited very weak  activity in a mechanism-based DNA-modifying yeast assay. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved  INTRODUCTION  The Celastraceae family is a rich source of ses-  quiterpene pyridine alkaloids derived from polyester  sesquiterpenes based on the dihydro-fl-agarofuran  skeleton [1]. They are characterized by a macrocyclic  structure formed by two ester linkages between a ses-  quiterpene and various dicarboxylic acids (e.g. evon-  inic acid, wilfordinic acid, edulinic acid, etc.) at pos-  itions 3 and 15 [2]. In our search for anticancer agents  employing a mechanism-based yeast bioassay for  DNA-modifying agents [3, 4] we have identified two  sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids from Maytenus aqui-  folium Martius. In this paper we report the isolation  and structural elucidation of two sesquiterpene pyri-  dine alkaloids aquifoliunine E-I (1) and aquifoliunine  E-II (2) from M. aquifolium by application of 2D  NMR spectroscopic techniques, including DQCOSY,  HETCOR, HMBC, HMQC and NOESY, and their  biological evaluation using the yeast bioassay system.  RESULTS  AND DISCUSSION  A CH2C12 soluble fraction from the methanolic  extract of root bark ofM. aquifolium was subjected to  silica gel column chromatography (CC). The fractions  obtained were further separated by silica gel (CC) to  give the sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids 1 and 2.  Aquifoliunine E-I (1), was shown to have a molec-  * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.  {Permanent address: Departamento de Morfologia,  CCBS, UFMS, C.P. 649, 79070-900, Brasil.

Its IR spectrum revealed  absorption bands at 3488, 1750 and 1443 cm-~ charac-  teristic of hydroxy, ester and phenyl groups, respec-  tively [5, 6]. The ~H and 13C NMR spectra ofl revealed  the presence of five acetyl groups (fin 1.82, 1.88, 2.14,  2.20, 2.33) and one benzoyl group [6H 7.43 (m), 7.57  (p), 7.92 (O)] (Tables 1 and 2). Proton assignments  around the bicyclic skeleton were determined based  on interpretation of the DQCOSY spectrum. The spin  system derived from H-let, H-2~, H-3fl, H-8fl and H-  9~ was readily recognized by starting with the 1H  doublet at 6 5.63 assigned to H-I~ (J~,.2~ = 3.5 Hz)  which showed a cross-peak with the 1H doublet of  doublets at 6 5.25 assigned to H-2ct (J2~.~ = 3.5,  J2~.3a = 2.5 Hz). This latter signal also showed a cross-  peak with the 1H doublet at 6 4.73 assigned to H-3fl  137  138  J. CORSINO et al.

(J3a.2~ = 2.5 Hz). The 1H doublet of doublets at 3 5.67  assigned to H-Sfl (J8a.7a = 3.6, Jsa,9~ = 9.9 Hz) showed  cross-peaks with the 1H doublets at 6 2.66 (H-7fl)  and 6 5.89 (H-9et). The latter proton signal was also  correlated with the H-8fl.  The relative stereochemistry of the H-8fl and H-  9ct was deduced from NOE difference experiment, in  which irradiation of the methine resonance at ~ 6.73  (H-6) caused an enhancement of the signal at 6 5.67  (H-8fl). The irradiation of the methyl resonance at 6  1.81 (H-14) caused an enhancement of the signal at 6  5.89 corroborating the axial orientation of H-9 (Fig.  1). The two sets of methylenic protons consisting of  two pairs of doublet of doublets at 6 4.62, 4.82  (Ju~.12b = 13.6 HZ) and 6 3.63, 5.96 (JJsalSb = 11.6 Hz)  were assigned to H-11 and H-15, respectively. The  presence of an esterified evoninic acid was indicated  by two doublets at 6 1.20 and 1.39 assigned to two  secondary methyl groups (H-10' and H-9') which  showed cross-peaks with a pair of resonances at 6 2.58  and 4.65 assigned to H-8' and H-7', respectively (q,  Js.. 10. and J7', 9' = 7.0 Hz). The configuration of the  methyl groups of the evoninate-type compounds were  determined as 7'S, 8'S (evoninic acid: 2S, 3S) by  hydrolysis [7] and X-ray analysis [8]. The 2,3-dis-  ubstituted pyridine unit was determined by the signals  at 6 7.23 (dd, J = 8.0, 4.8 Hz), 8.03 (dd, J = 1.6, 8.0  Hz) and 8.68 (dd, J = 1.6, 4.6 Hz) assigned to H-5',  H-4' and H-6', respectivity. The location of the ester  groups around the basic skeleton was solved by exam-  ination of the HMBC spectrum. The four acetoxy  carbonyl resonances at 6 168.6, 169.1, 169.7, 169.8  and 170.0 were correlated with 3H singlets at 6 2.14,  1.82, 2.20, 1.88 and 2.33, respectively, and the attach-  ment of these acetoxy groups at C-2, C-I, C-9, C-  6 and C-11 was established by defining cross-peaks  between the acetoxy carbonyl resonances and proton  signals at 6 5.25 (H-2et), 5.63 (H-let), 5.89 (H-9et), 6.73  (H-6fl) and 4.62-4.82 (H-I1). The signal at 6 164.5  was assigned to the carbonyl carbon of the benzoate  moiety based upon its cross-peak with the phenyl o-  protons at 6 7.92. The signals ofa carbonyl carbon at  6 165.6 was assigned to C-2' based on it cross-peaks  with the proton signals at 6 2.58, 4.65 (H-8', H-7')  and fi 1.20, 1.39 (H-10', H-9'). Further correlations  between the carbon signal at 6 174.0 (C-IV) and 6  168.4 (C-IT) with proton signals at 6 3.63-5.96 (H-  15) and 6 4.73 (H-3) proved the attachment of the  evoninate moiety to be at C-3 and C-15.

In addition, H-2c~ and H-8fl did not show any  cross-peaks with a carbonyl carbon resonance in the  HMBC spectrum. Again, HETCOR analysis was used  to assign the signals for all proton-bearing carbons.  The  known  compound  4'-O-methyl-(-)-epi-  gallocatechin (3) was earlier isolated from M. evony-  moides [10], M. riyida [11] and Ourotea sp. [12], while  syringaresinol (4) [13], a 3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane  lignan derivative, was isolated for the first time from  Maytenus species.  In the bioassay utilizing genetically engineered  mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the ses-  quiterpene alkaloids aquifoliunine E-I (1) and aqui-  foliunine E-II (2) exhibited very weak bioactivity.  Compounds I and 2 showed weak but selective activi-  ties with IC~2 values of 164 and 266; 160 and 167; 160  and 180/tg/mL in the mutant yeast strains RS 321N,  RS 322YK (rad 52Y), and RS 167N (tad 6), respec-  tively; they were inactive (IC~2 > 1000/~g/mL) in the  "wild type" strain RS 188N (rad+). These results  indicate these compounds might serve as the main  components responsible for the slight DNA-dam-  aging activity of M. aquifolium extract.  Multiplicity in the DEPT spectrum is given after the  respective chemical shifts: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet)  and q (quartet).  these have been revised based on HETCOR and  HMBC data (see Table 2).  Aquifoliunine  E-II  (2)  has  the  molecular  C34H43NO16 by analysis of its HRFABMS spectrum.  It also was an evoninate type sesquiterpene pyridine  alkaloid derivative of 1 and its sesquiterpene core  contained four acetyl groups. Further oxygenated  functional groups were assumed to be hydroxyl  groups. The positions of these hydroxyl groups were  confirmed at C-2 and C-8, where the H-2 and H-8 are  methine protons (6 4.06, dd, J2~,l~ = 3.5, J2~,3p = 2.6  Hz and 4.30, dd, J8#,7, = 3.5, J8,,9~ = 9.4 Hz) reson-  EXPERIMENTAL  Instrumentation and chromatoyraphy mater&&  Silica gel (Merck, 230-400 and 70-230 mesh) were  used for all column chromatography unless otherwise  stated and solvents were redistilled prior to use. ~H  and ~3C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian  Unity spectrometer at 400 and 100.57 MHz, respec-  tively with TMS as a internal standard. IR spectra  were  obtained  on  a  Nicolet  spectrometer.  HRFABMS: at 70 EV VG 7070E-HF. Optical activi-  ties were measured on a Polamat A, Carl Zeiss Jena.  Plant material  M. aquifolium root bark was collected at Ribeir~o  Preto, S~o Paulo and classified by Dr Rita Maria de  140  J. CORSINO et al.  Carvalho. The voucher specimen is deposited in the  Herbarium of the University of Campinas, S~o Paulo,  Brazil.  Bioassays  The experimental method utilized in the screening  procedure has been described elsewhere [3, 4]. The ICL2  values refer to the concentration in/~g/mL required to  produce a zone of inhibition of 12 mm diameter  around a 100/~1 well during a 48 h incubation period  at 37'~C.  Extraction and isolation of constituents  The dried and powdered root bark ofM. aquiJolium  (153.5 g) was extracted with MeOH. The resulting  MeOH extract was filtered and concd in vacuo to  afford a brown gum (17.35 g). The CH2C12 soluble  part of MeOH extract (1.43 g) was applied to a Si gel  column (300 g), and eluted with hexane containing  increasing amounts of EtOAc to give 68 frs. Fr. 10  (720 mg) was applied to a Si gel column (2.0 g) 230-  400 mesh, and eluted with CHC13 with increasing  amounts of MeOH to give 1 (9.8 rag). Fr. 14 (22.2  mg) was subjected to Si gel CC, eluted with CHC13  containing an increasing amount of MeOH to give 4  (5.1 rag). Fr. 20 (23.6 mg) was chromatographed on  silica gel (CC) eluted with CHCI3 containing increas-  ing amounts of MeOH to give 2 (2.6 mg). Fr. 30 (149.8  mg) was applied to Si gel (CC) eluted with CHC13  containing increasing amount of MeOH to give 3 (3.7  rag).  Aqufoliunine E-I (1). Amorphous solid. [c~]r~-3.1 t'  (CHCI¢ c 3.2).
