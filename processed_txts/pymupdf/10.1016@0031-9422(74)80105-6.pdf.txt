Abstract-Two  novel peltogynoids,  7-0-methylpeltogynol  and 4-O-methyl-4’,5’-O,O-methylidenemopanol  were  isolated  respectively  from the trunk wood of Peltogyne  paniculatn Benth. and P. confertijora Benth. The latter  species, as well as P. catingar  Ducke, also contain  the common  peltogynoids  peltogynol  and mopanol.  A RECENT investigation of Goniorrhachis marginata Taub. (Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae)  revealed the existence in its heartwood of peltogynoid  flavanones and chalcones.‘.’  The  genus was, consequently, considered to have evolved into Peltogyne, the known species of  which contain mainly peltogynoid flavonols.2 Since Goniorrhachis is monotypic, the only  way of placing this hypothesis on firmer ground and, eventually, to use it as basis of a  phyletic classification  of related genera, requires the analysis of additional  Peltogyne  species.  A search for peltogynoids  in the bark  of Peltogyne  confertijlora  Benth.  (from  Espirito Santo State), P. catingae Ducke and P. panicdata Benth. (both from Amazonas  State) was unsuccessful. Only a glycoside of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin)  was located  in P. confertijora.  The heartwoods,  however,  of P. catingae and  P.  confertij?ora were found to contain peltogynol  (la) and mopanol  (2a), typical con-  stituents of Peltogyne and related genera. From the C,H,  extracts of P. panicdata and  P. confertiflora two additional  phenols, respectively  C, ,H1 606 and C, sH1606,  were  isolated. Their UV spectra were very similar to those of peltogynol and mopanol, so they  were considered to be closely related peltogynoids. Comparisons of the PMR spectra in  the acetate series not only confirmed this (see chemical shifts of aliphatic protons with  lit.3 data), but also indicated identical relative configurations at the chiral centres 2, 3 and  4 (cf. 52.3  and J,.,). Attribution  of the substitution  pattern of peltogynol to C17H1606  and of mopanol to C, sH I 6O6 was based on the analysis of the aromatic spectral regions.  * Part XL111 in the series “The Chemistry  of Brazilian  Leguminosae”.

Two additional  compounds,  probably  insertion  products.’  were also detected  in  trace  amounts  in  these  reaction  mixtures.  The  substitution  pattern  of the  novel  7,3’-di-0-methylpeltogynol  (le) was identified  through  PMR spectral comparison  (CDCl,)  of two  pairs  of compounds:  its monomethyl  ether  (lg)  and  its diacetate  (lf)  vs  7-0-methylpeltogynol  triacetate  (Id) and peltogynol  tetraacetate  ( lb).3 The 3’-positions  in the first pair are substituted  by methoxyls  and in the second  pair by acetoxyls.

Three pieces of evidence show that the methoxyl  (t 6.38, s) is at C-4 : (1). The H-4 chemical shifts of the acetate (2e) and of tri-O-  acetylmopanol  (2b) are comparable  (r 5.35 and 5.33) suffering the expected  large  downfield shift (A - 1.59 ppm) if the hydroxyl at C-4 appears in acetylated form, as in  2c (2). The MS of the derivative (Scheme 1) conforms to the pattern observed for other  flavanols of this series2 with the exception of the [M-H,O]+:  peak which is replaced by a  strong [M-MeOH]+‘peak  (3). While tri-0-methylmopanol(2f)  and tri-0-methylpeltogynol  (Ig) readily give tri-0-methylmopanone  and tri-0-methylpeltogynone  with the Jones  reagent, the novel phenol is quite stable under oxidizing conditions.  Thus, the lone  phenolic hydroxyl can only be situated at C-7, as in 2d.  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation of the constituents oj’ P. confertiflora.
