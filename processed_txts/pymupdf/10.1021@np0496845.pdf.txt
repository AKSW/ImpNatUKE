Methyl 1R,2�,3R,6,8R,14�-hexahydroxy- [4.2.110,30.11,4]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate, scopoletin, and 3-O-�-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol were also isolated. The limonoids were of little value to clarify the basis of the nonresistance against Hypsipyla grandella. Khaya senegalensis (Desr.) A. Juss. (Meliaceae) occurs in the sub-Saharan savannah area from Senegal to Uganda.1 However, this was introduced in Brazil and showed excel- lent growth and an absence of attacks by the shoot borer Hypsipyla grandella, in contrast to the native K. anthoth- eca.2,3 To determine the phytochemical basis of this resis- tance, we examined the exotic K. senegalensis and we isolated five limonoids, e.g., methyl 1R,6,8R,14�,30�-pen- tahydroxy-3-oxo-[3.3.110,2.11,4]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate (1) and methyl 1R,2�,3R,6,8R,14�-hexahydroxy-[4.2.110,30.11,4]-tri- cyclomeliac-7-oate (2).2,3 The latter represented a new group of methyl tricyclomeliac-7-oates. Thus, the resistance of exotic K. senegalensis to native H. grandella may well be due to the presence of the methyl [4.2.110,30.11,4]- tricyclomeliac-7-oate limonoids. However, it would not be surprising if these limonoids had remained undiscovered in the K. anthotheca because of their low concentrations or due to seasonal variations in the chemical composition of its species. Therefore, it was premature to draw any conclusions about the role of tricyclo-[4.2.110,30.11,4]-decane limonoids in a possible coevolutionary relationship between Meliaceae and H. grandella, until the native K. anthotheca could be re-evaluated for the presence of these limonoids. To establish this, we have now undertaken a further investigation of stems of K. anthotheca. A dichloromethane-soluble fraction of the MeOH extract of the stems of K. anthotheca was purified by repeated column chromatography on silica gel and preparative TLC to give 2,2,3 scopoletin, sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, 3-O-�-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol, and two new limonoids (3, 4). The limonoid 3 was identified on the basis of the following data. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) indicated the presence of three tertiary methyl groups (δ 0.92, 0.99, 1.48), three downfield shifted signals attributed to a 3-substituted furan ring (δ 7.47, 7.46, 6.40), four signals characteristic of protons attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom (δ 4.20 d, J ) 12.0 Hz; 4.40 d, J ) 12.0 Hz; 5.27 s; 5.59 s), and two AB-type methylenes (δ 2.86 d, J ) 19 Hz; 3.04 d, J ) 19 Hz; and 1.89 d, J ) 14 Hz; 2.69 d, J ) 14 Hz). From the HMBC experiments (Table 1) the observed correlation between the 1H signal at δ 5.27, assigned to H-17, and the C signal at δ 140.8 (C-21) determined the position of the furan ring at C-17. The signal for H-17 showed a one-bond correlation with the C signal at δ 77.2. The methyl proton at δ 0.99 showed long- range correlations with the C-17 signal (δ 77.2) and the C signals at δ 30.4 (CH2, by HSQC and DEPT 135°), 40.3 (quaternary), and 71.9 (quaternary), thus indicating the hydroxyl group to be located at C-14 and leading to their assignments as H3-18, C-12, C-13, and C-14, respectively. The C-12 signal at δ 30.4 showed a one-bond correlation with the protons at δ 1.54 and 1.84, which were coupled to each other and to the hydrogens at δ 1.39 and 1.63, and both latter signals also showed cross-peaks with the C at δ 20.6 in the HSQC experiments. These signals were then assigned to H2-12, H2-11, and C-11, respectively. The large * To whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel: +55-16-3351-8093. Fax: +55-16-3351/8350.

Prod. 2005, 68, 413-416 10.1021/np0496845 CCC: $30.25 © 2005 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 02/12/2005 geminal coupling constant of the C-15 methylene protons was consistent with their position R to a carbonyl group with C-14 fully substituted. This was supported by the long-range correlations of the H2-15 signals at δ 2.86 and 3.04 to the C-16 signal at δ 169.0, indicating a D-ring δ-lactone system. Moreover, the existence of correlation between the H2-15 signals and the carbon at δ 81.2 indicated a tertiary hydroxyl substituent at C-8 or cyclic ether. The AB-type methylene protons at δ 2.69 and 1.89 (d, J ) 14.0 Hz) were attributed to H2-30 by their correla- tion with the C-8 and suggested the presence of a mexi- canolide limonoid. Two methyl groups at δ 0.92 and 1.48 showed cross-peaks with the C signal at δ 75.6, which showed a one-bond correlation with the proton at δ 5.59, and this in turn had a long-range correlation to the C signal at δ 170.0, thus indicating an acetoxyl substituent at C-3 and establishing their assignments as H3-28, H3-29, C-3, and H-3, respectively. The chemical shifts of C-4 and C-5 were established as δ 38.8 (quaternary) and 37.7 (CH), respectively, via correlations of H3-28 and H3-29 and the carbon signals. The oxymethylene protons at δ 4.20 and 4.40 were coupled only to each other and showed a one- bond correlation with the carbon at δ 73.3 (CH2) and long- range correlations with C-5 and the carbon at δ 173.2, suggesting the presence of a 19-7 lactone ring, since it was the only location left in the nucleus. The H2-6 chemical shift was established as δH 2.54 m (δ 29.8, by HSQC) via correlation with C-7 (δ 173.2). Similarly, C-10 and C-9 were assigned via correlation of H2-19 signals and the carbons at δ 47.5 (quaternary) and 52.5 (CH), respectively. Two oxygen atoms must also be connected at C-1 due to the observed correlations between H2-19 and the carbon at δ 107.6. The deshielded carbon resonance required the pres- ence of a hemiketal involving a tertiary hydroxyl at C-1 and a cyclic ether formed by joining C-1 to O-8, which agreed closely with published data for seneganolide (5, δ 107.7, C-1).4 The relationship of the hydroxylic proton at δ 7.64 to C-1 and C-10, as well as of a second hydroxylic proton at δ 2.82 to C-13, led to their assignments as OH-1 and OH-14, respectively. Moreover, the OH-1 also showed a long-range correlation with the carbon at δ 93.6, which was attributed to C-2. The deshielded resonance observed here (δ 93.6) is not typical of a 2-acetoxymexicanolide, when compared with procerin (a 2-acetoxytricyclo-[3.3.110,2.11,4]- decane system, δ 83.1, C-2).5 The 13C NMR showed the presence of a second O-acetyl group (δ 175.2, Table 1). The HR-mass spectrum and ESI-MS indicated the molecular formula to be C30H36O13 (m/z 604.21559), and the fragments at m/z 611 (M + K - O2, 35%)6 suggested the presence of an acylperoxy group at C-2, whose spectroscopic properties are in accord with the above data. Several limonoids with peroxide substituents have been isolated;7 however, the presence of an acylperoxy functionality is reported here for the first time. Various stable peroxy esters have been synthesized, 1-(acylperoxy)adamantanes8 and 1-acetoper- oxy-2-oxabicyclo-[4.3.0]-nonane, 1-acetoperoxy-2-oxabicyclo- [4.4.0]-decane, and 1-acetoperoxy-2-oxabicyclo-[4.10.0]- hexadecane.9 Table 1.

The NOEs between the hydroxyl proton at δ 2.82 and H3-18 and H-15R allowed the assignment of this signal to 14-OH, also showing that the hydroxyl group at C-14 is thus in the R-orientation. In the same way, the NOEs between the hydroxyl proton at δ 7.64 and H3-29R and H-3 show that this signal can be attributed to the 1R-OH and that H-3 is on the R-side of the molecule. The new natural product is, therefore, 1R,8R-oxido-3�-acetoxy-2R-acylperoxy-1R,14R-di- hydroxy-[3.3.110,2]-bicyclomeliac-7,19-olide (3). The struc- tural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with that of seneganolide (5).4 Limonoid 4 also showed the spectroscopic characteristics of a furan ring at C-17 and a D-ring δ-lactone system. However, instead of signals for a 14-hydroxy δ-lactone, it showed a signal for one olefinic proton (δ 6.02, s), which was attributed to H-15 by its HMBC correlation with C-16 (δ 165.8). Moreover, the existence of a correlation between H-15 and the carbon at δ 141.9 indicated a double bond between C-8 and C-9 or C-8 and C-30. A mexicanolide limonoid with a double bond between C-8 and C-30 would show a signal for an olefinic proton at ca. δ 5.40 in the 1H NMR spectrum.5 Thus, placement of the double bond between C-8 and C-9 was confirmed by the absence of a second olefenic proton. The chemical shift of C-12 was established as δ 31.8, via correlations between H-17 (δ 5.18, s) and C-12. C-12 showed one-bond correlations with the protons at δ 2.18 and 1.57, and the latter signal also showed cross-peaks with the carbon at δ 130.6, which was attributed to C-9, confirming the presence of a double bond between C-8 and C-9. In the same way, C-14 emerged from the correlation between H3-18 (δ 1.02) and the carbon at δ 150.8. The resonances observed for C-8 (δ 141.9) and C-9 (δ 130.6) are not typical of an 8,14-dien-mexicanolide, when compared with methyl 1,3-dioxo-8,14-dien-[3.3.110,2]-bicy- clomeliac-7-olide (C-8, δ 124.6; C-9, δ 150.9).5 The above data indicated that compound 4 was not a normal mexi- canolide limonoid. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) indi- cated the presence of an O-methyl singlet (δ 3.84, s), showing a cross-peak with the carbon at δ 173.4 in the HMBC experiments (Table 1), hence indicating a car- bomethoxy group at C-7. H2-6 resonated at δH 2.39 dd, J ) 4.2 and 7.3 H2 (δ 31.8, by HSQC), as established by its correlation with C-7 (δ 173.4). C-4, C-5, and C-10 were assigned via the correlations of H2-6 and the carbons at δ 44.3 (quaternary), 46.8 (CH), and 57.6 (quaternary), re- spectively. The methyl proton at δ 1.13 showed long-range correlations with C-5 and C-10 and the carbon at δ 117.2 (quaternary), leading to its assignments as H3-19 and indicating a hydroxyl group to be located at C-1. The AB- type methylene protons at δ 2.50 and 1.97 (d, J ) 14.0 Hz) were attributed to H2-29 by their correlation with C-1, C-4, C-5, and C-10. Moreover, H2-29 also showed cross-peaks with the carbons at δ 80.4 (CH by DEPT 135°) and 18.5 (CH3), confirming their assignments as C-3 and C-28, respectively. The carbon at δ 80.4 showed a one-bond correlation with the proton at δ 4.63 and this long-range correlation to the carbons at δ 170.4 and 205.6, thus indicating an acetoxyl substituent at C-3 and a carbonyl at C-2 (or C-30), if we would be dealing with a normal 1,29-cyclomeliacate skeleton. The deshielded resonance for C-1 (δ 117.2) is typical of seneganolide (5, δ 107.7, C-1),4 requiring the presence of a hemiketal involving a tertiary hydroxyl at C-1 and a cyclic ether formed by joining C-1 to O-8. Oxygenated C-8 may have caused an upfield shift for C-9 (δ 130.6) and a downfield shift for C-8 (δ 141.9), when compared with 1,3-dioxo-8,14-dien-[3.3.110,2]-bicyclomeliac- 7-olide (C-8, δ 124.6; C-9, δ 150.9).5 The 1H and 13C NMR showed an additional methyl group (δH 2.19, s; δC 28.7; Table 1). From HMBC experiments these methyl protons showed a correlation with the carbon at δ 205.6. It is interesting to note that a similar structure, khayalactone (6), has been isolated from Khaya grandifoliola.11 In principle cleavage of C-8 and C-30 and formation of double bonds between C-8/C-9 and C-14/C-15 may have occurred, resulting in 8,14-dien-8,30-seco-khayalactone, whose spec- troscopic properties correspond with the above data. The protons at δH 2.19, δC 28.7 and 205.6 were then assigned Scheme 1. Possible Route for the Biogenesis of 4 and 6 Notes Journal of Natural Products, 2005, Vol. 68, No. 3 415 to H3-30, C-30, and C-2, respectively, and suggested the presence of an isolated structural unit, -CH(OAc)COCH3 (C3-C2-C30), connected at C-4. The NOESY experiments (Table 1) showed correlations between H-3 and H2-6, H3-19, and H-29R (δ 2.50). This implies that the unit -CH(OAc)COCH3 (C3-C2-C30) is on the R-side of the molecule. In the NOESY 1D experiment measured in DMSO-d6, irradiation of the 1-OH signal did not influence any group with a spatial proximity such as Me-19. How- ever, the hydroxylic proton was detected as a weak resonance at δ 8.30. Thus, this experiment did not facilitate elucidation of the relative configuration of C-1. Molecules containing an unusual trans-fused cyclopentane ring sys- tem have been synthesized; nevertheless, they are ther- modynamically less favorable.12 This observation suggests that in 4 both 1-OH and Me-19 occupy the R-face of the molecule. The HR-mass spectrum confirmed the molecular formula as C29H34O10 (m/z 542.2152), and the largest fragment observed in the ESI-MS/MS was m/z 469 for [M + H - OAc - Me]+. Thus, the structure of the new limonoid was characterized as 3-acetoxy-8,14-dien-8,30-seco-khaya- lactone (4). The structural assignment was also supported by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those of khayalactone (6).11 As reported in previous paper, the resistance of exotic K. senegalensis to native H. grandella may well be owing to the presence of the methyl [4.2.110,30.11,4]-tricyclomeliac- 7-oate limonoids as 2.2,3 However, their action is now debatable, since unresistant K. anthotheca afforded li- monoid 2. Limonoids with a tricyclo-[3.3.110,2.11,4]-decane system (1) were found in K. senegalensis, but not in K. anthotheca; however they might be the biosynthetic inter- mediates to limonoids 2 and 4. Thus, the limonoids were of little value to clarify the basis of the resistance in K. senegalensis against Hypsipyla grandella. A possible pathway leading to the formation of khaya- lactone (6) and limonoid 4 can be proposed by comparison with the route reported for tricyclo-[4.2.110,30.11,4]-decane limonoids.2,3 A pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement of 2,3- dihydroxy-1,8-peroxy-1,29-cyclomeliacate (7) and 2,3,14- trihydroxy-1,8-peroxy-1,29-cyclomeliacate (8) precursors may have occurred, resulting in the intermediates 9 and 10, respectively. Subsequent addition of a hydroxyl group at C-8 to C-1 in 9 may lead to khayalactone (6). Elimination of H2O at C-14/C-15, the loss of H-9 with formation of an enolate at C-8, subsequent addition of a hydroxyl group at C-8 to C-1, and acetylation of 3-OH may have occurred in 10, resulting in 4 (Scheme 1). Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. NMR spectra (1H and 13C NMR; DEPT; HMBC; HSQC; COSY; NOESY-TPPI; and NOEDIF) were obtained on a Bruker DRX 400, with TMS as internal standard and the solvent CDCl3; ESI-MSMS low resolution spectra were performed on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC instrument, equipped with a “Z-spray” ion source; HRMS were obtained on a Fisons VG Autospec; IR spectra were recorded on a Bomen-Ft/IR; [R]D was measured with a Perkin-Elmer 241 instrument. Plant Material. Khaya anthotheca was collected in Vic¸osa, MG, Brazil, and identified by J. R. Pirani (Universidade de Sa˜o Paulo). A voucher (4863) is deposited in the Herbarium of Instituto de Biocieˆncias, USP, Sa˜o Paulo. Extraction and Isolation. Grounds stems (1000 g) were extracted with hexane, then EtOAc and finally with MeOH. The concentrated MeOH extract was partitioned into CH2Cl2- EtOAc- and n-BuOH-soluble fractions. The concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with a CH2Cl2-EtOAC-MeOH gradient afforded eight fractions and 3-O-�-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol (20 mg). Fraction 5 was repeatedly chromatographed on silica gel (hexane-CH2Cl2- MeOH gradient, 2:10:1), yielding scopoletin, sitosterol, stig- masterol, campesterol, and a mixture of limonoids, which after final purification by TLC (hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 2:8:1) afforded compounds 2 (4 mg), 3 (5 mg), and 4 (6 mg). 1r,8r-Oxido-3�-acetoxy-2r-acylperoxy-1r,14r-dihy- droxy-[3.3.110,2]-bicyclomeliac-7,19-olide (3): gum; [R]D -69° (CHCl3, c 0.003); IR νmax (CHCl3) cm-1 3438, 1732, 1638, 1368, 1240, 1019, 866, 748; NMR data, Table 1; ESI-MSMS, m/z (rel int) 643 [M + K]+ (32), 611 [M + K - O2]+ (35), 583 (100), 523 (10); HR-MS m/z 604.2123 (calcd for C30H36O13, 604.2155). 3-Acetoxy-8,14-dien-8,30-seco-khayalactone (4): gum; [R]D +68° (CHCl3, c 0.005); IR νmax (CHCl3) cm-1 3422, 3020, 1730, 1646, 1209, 758, 669; NMR data, Table 1; ESI-MSMS, m/z (rel int) 543 [M + H]+ (20), 469 [M + H - OAc - CH3]+ (100), 301 (70), 177 (75); HR-MS m/z 542.2133 (calcd for C29H34O10, 542.2152).
