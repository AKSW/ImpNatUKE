Abstract-The  seeds of Otoba paruifolia contain three novel compounds apparently derived from homogentisic acid,  reI-(l’R,5’R)-2-(1’-farnesyl-5’-hydroxy-~-oxocyclohex-3’-en-l’-yl)-acetic  acid  and  its acetate  as well as rel-  (l’R,4’S,SR)-2-( l’-farnesyl-4’,5’-dihydroxy-2’-oxocyclohexan-l’-yl)-acetic  acid d-lactone. The structure of an addi-  tional isolate, previously described as 2-( l’-farnesyl-2’-hydroxy-S-oxocyclohex-3’-en-  1’-yl)-acetic acid y-lactone was  revised to rel-(l’R,S’R)-2-(l’-farnesyl-S-hydroxy-2’-oxocyclohex-3’-en-l’-yl)-acetic  acid d-lactone.  INTRODUCTION  RESULTS  Fruit kernels of Otoba paruijolia (Mkfg.) A. Gentry from  the Amazon region have been reported to contain, be-  sides sitosterol and the furofuran lignans xanthoxylol  and philygenol, some homogentisic acid (1) derived com-  pounds, attributed to structures 2, 3a, 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b  [2]. Re-examination  of the same material revealed the  additional presence of three further compounds,  6a, 6b  and 7a. Fruit pericarp was found to contain sitosterol,  nerolidol, the neolignan  hydroxyotobain  [3], the furo-  furan lignans xanthoxylol and forsythigenol [4], as well  as 6b. Meanwhile, in the quest of a model for 3a, com-  pound  3b was synthesized [S]. The spectral data for  the synthetic product (IR,,,  1780 and 1686 cm-‘) and  the natural  isolate (IR,,,  1742 and 1683 cm-‘)  were  significantly  different (see also Tables l-3). Thus, the  present work required not only the structural determina-  tion of the novel isolates 6a, 6b and 7a, but also the  structural revision of 3a, now designated 8.  The ‘H (Tables 1 and 2) and 13C (Table 3) NMR  spectra in combination  with low resolution mass spectral  molecular weight determinations  (Table 4) established  the formulae C,,H,,O,  (6c), Cz6H3s05 (6d) (the respect-  ive methyl esters of 6s and 6b) and C,,H,,O,  (7a).  Routine examination  of the NMR spectra allowed ex-  pansion of the formulae to CsH,O, . OH. OMe Fa (6c),  C,H,O, . OAc . OMe . Fa (&I) and C,H,O, . OH. Fa (7a)  (Fa = farnesyl) and led to the conclusion that all three  must be closely related to the co-occurring known com-  pound  CsH,O,.  Fa (8 = 7a-H,O).  Indeed the mass  spectra of all four compounds  are closely comparable  (Table 4). IR spectral  comparisons  showed the 6-  lactone of 7a (I$:: 1741 cm- ‘), though present in 8 (vi:  1742 cm-‘),  to be replaced by an ester in 6e and 6d  (vZaT 1732 f 1 cm- ‘); and the a&unsaturated  carbonyl  of 8 (vale 1683 cm-‘), though present in 6c and 6d (vale  1679 f 2 cm-‘), to be replaced by a saturated carbonyl  in 7a (~2: ca 1712 cm-‘). Hydrolysis of the lactone of  8 would generate a hydroxyl at a trisubstituted  C-5’ as  shown in 6e. Acetylation of this hydroxyl is expected to  cause an ca 1 ppm paramagnetic  shift of the carbinolic  proton signal and ca 4 ppm paramagnetic  shifts of the  C-4’ and C-6’ signals. These are precisely the relevant ‘H  and 13C NMR spectral modifications upon passing from  6e to 6d, all other features remaining closely comparable.  The hydroxyls in 6c and 6d are both a-oriented. Indeed,  only for this conformation,  but not for the anti-  podal orientation  shown in the model 6e, observed and  *Part 38 in the series ‘The Chemistry of Brazilian Myris-  ticaceae’.

With respect  to position  l’, it is the farnesyl  substituent  which is axial. Only in this case, one of the  acetic acid methylene  protons  lies in the plane of the ring  carbonyl,  as documented  by the corresponding  NMR  signal an extraordinarily  low field (62.9).  No CH=CHCO  signals appear  in the spectra  of 7a  where the ketone carbonyl  is flanked by a methylene  and  a quaternary  carbon.  This locates the hydroxyl,  jointly  with a sole proton  (63.93), at C-4’. In contradistinction  such an r&unsaturated  carbonyl appears again in the  additional B-lactone 8. The rings in both compounds, 7a  and 8, must be c&-fused. Hence, only the orientation  of  the free hydroxyl in 7a remains to be established. This is  equatorial. Indeed only for this conformation,  but not  for the antipodal  orientation  shown in the model 7b,  observed  and calculated  vicinal coupling  constants  are  compatible  (Table 2).  DISCUSSION  The co-occurrence in 0. parvifolia of homogentisic acid  and of nerolidol rationalizes the formation of the alkyla-  tion product 9 as a common intermediate  of the oxo-  cyclopentanylpropionic  acids 4a, b and Sa, b [2] (via  1’,2’-rearrangement of CH,CO,H  and ring contraction)  and of oxocyclohexanylacetic  acids 6a, b, 7b and 8 (via  reduction of the oxo-group).  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation of constituents. Fruits of 0. paroifolia were  collected by Dr Hip6lito Ferreira Paulino Filho in the  vicinity of Humaitl, Amazonas State. Botanical material  1728  A. G. FERREIRA  et al.  was identified  by Dr William  A. Rodrigues,  INPA,  Manaus. Air-dried fruits were separated into pericarps  and seeds.s Ground dry pericarp meal (90 g) was extrac-  ted with CHCI,. The extract (19 g) was submitted to CC  (240 g Silica gel 60). Elution with CHCl, gave, in order:  fatty material (2 g), nerolidol (35 mg), hydroxyotobain  (21 mg), forsythigenol  (1 g), xanthoxylol  (21 mg), sito-  sterol (18 mg) and a crude fraction (903 mg), which was  treated with CH,N,  in Et,O. The reaction product was  purified by prep. TLC (silica gel, hexane-Me&O,  4: 1)  into 6d (60 mg). Nerolidol  and hydroxyotobain  were  purified by prep. TLC (silica gel, hexane-Me,CO,  4: 1).  All other compounds  were purified by crystallization  from MeOH. The ground dry seed meal (1100 g) was  extracted with CHCl,. The extract (380g) was crystal-  lized from MeOH to fatty material (165 g). The mother  liquor was evapd and the residue (8 g) was submitted to  CC (280g Silica gel 60). Elution with CHCl, gave, in  order: fatty material (556 mg), 8 (60 mg), forsythigenol  (16 mg), sitosterol (15 mg) and 7a (10 mg). Elution with  CHCl,-EtOAc  gave a crude fr. (186 mg) which was  treated with CH,N,  in Et,O. The reaction product was  sepd by prep. TLC (silica gel, CHCl,-MeOH.  9: 1) into  6d (18 mg) and 6c (6 mg).  rel-(l’R,5’R)-2-(1’-Farnesyl-5’-hydroxy-2’-oxocyc~o-  hex-3’-en-l’-y&acetic  acid methyl ester (6~). Oil.
