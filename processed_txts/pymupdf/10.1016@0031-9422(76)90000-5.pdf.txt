Abstract-The  hevood of a Licaria species (Quraceae)  contains two neolignans, eusiderin, re1-(2R,3R)-l-allyl-5-  methoxy-2~3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methylbenzodioxan, and aurein, 244-allyloxy-3,5-methoxypheny1)-1-(3,4,5-tri- methoxypheny1)-propane.  \  >  The classification of a Licarh species [4], trivial name  "louro figa\do de galinha", from the vicinity of Manaus,  Amazonas, will be possible upon completion of the revi-  sion of Lauraceae by Dr. K. Kubitzki, Hamburg. Its  trunk wood contains two neolignans: eusiderin, which  was located previously in the Indonesian Lauraceae spe-  cies Elcideroxylotr mageri T. et B.[2], and a compound  which was designated aurein in a plant thought to be  Licaria alrrea (Huber) Kosterm. [3].  .  Structural proposals for eusiderin, ClsH,,O2(0Me),,  based mainly on the recognition that no phenolic degra-  dation products were observed othcr than pyrogallol der-  ivatives, included not only the benzodioxan alternatives  la and lb, but also isomeric formulations such as 2 121.  Re-examination of this problem, by modern spectro- metric techniques, invalidated any but the benzodioxan  structures, indicated the correct alternative and suggested  the trans-relationship between the aryl and methyl sub-  stituents.  Indeed, the most abundant MS fragment ion revealed  the existence of the system (Me0)3C,H2CHCHMe  which, according to PMR evidence,jncludes two equival-  ent aromatic protons (~3.40, s) and two vicinal aliphatic  oxymethines; one linked to phenyl (~5.46, d, 58.0 Hz) and  the other to methyl (55.7-6.3, m). The two oxygens must  participate in the additional pyrogallol moiety, which,  furthermore, supports the fourth methoxyl and an ally1  group (n-propyl inthe dihydroderivative), flanked by two  t~leta-related aromatic protons (~3.63 and 3.51).  The Pr(fod), induced diamagnetic shift of the doublet  at ~3.63 (A2.4 ppm) is larger than that of the doublet  at ~3.51 (A2.0 ppm), and the former signal must thus be  assigned to the proton in ortho relation with respect to  the oxy-methoxy coordination site.

While the 52 value is typical for an ortho-proton  in 1,2-dimethoxybenzenes, the 44 value is about twice  as strong as would b e  expected for a para-proton [4].  This indicates the vicinity of the para-proton to an ad-  ditional coordination site identified with the orrho-tri-  methoxy function of the aryl group, since the benzodiox-  ane oxygens associate only feebly with the reagent [4].  Formula la, and not lb, thus emerges as the correct  Rl ...  2  OMe  ,, ,I ,,,,,,-,,,  M,y~w,R~ZMeeR33011Yl  ,, R1,Me,$-3,4.5-trlmethoxyprary1.~3-a~~y~  1,  R ~ - ~ , ~ , ~ - + ~ ~ H M X ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ .

The [roils-arrangement of the  Substituents on this benzodioxane, compatible with the  low field Me-3 signal (78.77) and the relatively  large J Z e 3(8.0 HZ) of the PMR spectrum [5], was inferred  from the 13CNMR spectrum. This showed, by compari-  son lvith model neolignan spectra, that the methyl group  must be beyond non-bonded interaction range of the  neighbo~ring aryl substituent [ll].  The formula C1  50(OMe)5. determined for aurein  by HR MS and PMR, suggested its structural relation  to eusiderin (la). It became clear immediately, however,  that here the two Cg-moieties cannot be linked by an  oxygen bridge. While dihydroeusiderin (lc) is cleaved  into 1,~,~-trihydroxy-5-rI-Propy~ben~ene by HI/AcqH at  reflux temperaturep - ~ ,  dihydroaurein.(later foimulated  3b) leads to a phenol C ~ ~ H ~ O ( O H ) h   ' (3C)' The PMR 'pet- trum of this phenol and of its hexaacetate (34 are devoid  of sipals due to an J l - ~ r o ~ ~ l   group, and, hence, the ally1  group of aurein must etherify the undefined oxygen of  its formula given above. Indeed, pyrolysis (to 3e 56%  yield) and acid treatment (to 3g 76% yield) of aurein  easily cleave this 0-allyl. The former reaction is relevant,  since loss of the ally1 group shoivs that the 0- and pposi-  tions Felative to the O-allyl group are substituted. In  the latter reaction, comparison of t h e P M R  spectrum  shows that the O-allyl group (OCH2- r5'53) of  is replaced in the rearrangement product (3d by a C-all~l  group (CCH?, z6.75) which genemtes a C-1l-pr0pyl group  (CCH,, r8.44) after hydrogenation (3). In 3% one of the  two pairs of equivalent aromatic protons (r3.68, s) in  aurein is reduced to one lone proton (r3.56, s), while  on this postulate was achieved [7], while 4 and 6 would  give an intermediate which, upon hydrogen addition and  retr0-Claisen rearrangement, would lead to aurein (3a).  This singular process recalls the biosynthesis of thyr-  oxin [8] where, however, the final dienone-phenol re.  arrangement causes the loss of a three-carbon fragment.  The retro-Claisen reaction was postulated previously to  rationalize the biosynthesis of  another neolignan  type [9,10].  ._  \  ESPERIJIEKTAL  Isolotiorz of i~le,constitue~tts.A specimen of Licnria sp.
