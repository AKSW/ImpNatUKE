Introduction The Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families are rich sources of quinonemethide triterpenes (Br€uning and Wagner, 1978; Gunatilaka, 1996), and these compounds have a variety of biological activities such as antitumor (Bhatnagar et al., 1979; Gonc�alves de Lima et al., 1971), antimicrobial (Ferreira de Santana et al., 1971); antibi- otic (Gonc�alves de Lima et al., 1969; Gonzalez et al., 1977); cytotoxic (Setzer et al., 1998) and antimalarial (Pavanand et al., 1989; Figueiredo et al., 1998) proper- ties. Systematic studies on Celastraceae and Hippo- crateaceae plant species (Corsino et al., 1998a,b,c, 2000, 2003; Buﬀa Filho et al., 2002) have been concerned with biosynthesis of quinonemethide triterpenes, the main secondary metabolites in this taxon. The biosynthetic study dealing on Maytenus aquifolium (Celastraceae) and Salacia campestris (Hippocrateaceae) indicated that friedelane triterpenes are putative precursors of qui- nonemethide triterpenes, which are biosynthesized in the leaves and translocated to the root bark, where these compounds would be transformed into quinonemethide triterpenes (Corsino et al., 2000). These ﬁndings have led us to investigate other species of Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae. Cheiloclinium cognatum (Miers) A.C. Sm. (Hippocrateaceae) a tree widely distributed in the Cerrado region of Brazil, was selected to investigate the oxidative transformation on the E ring of the quinon- emethide triterpenes. With this objective, we carried out a chemical study on this plant species, which led to the isolation of two new triterpenes, 22b-hydroxypristimerin (1) and cognatine (2), besides seven known quinon- emethide triterpenes; pristimerin (3), maytenin (4), 22b-hydroxymaytenin (5), 20a-hydroxymaytenin (6), netzahualcoyonol (7), netzahualcoyondiol (8) and net- zahualcoyone (9). The free radical scavenging activities of the isolates have been evaluated through a spectro- photometric assay using the stable free radical 2,2-di- phenyl-picryl hydrazyl(DPPH). * Corresponding author.

Results and discussion A CH2Cl2 soluble fraction obtained from the ethan- olic extract of the root bark C. cognatum was subjected to silica gel column chromatography. The fractions obtained were further puriﬁed by preparative TLC and/ or HPLC, aﬀording compounds 1–9. 22b-Hydroxypristimerin (1), obtained as a red amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C30H40O5 by analysis of its ESI/MS spectrum, elemental analysis and 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 3450 cm�1 (hydroxyl group) and 1724 and 1645 cm�1 (carbonyl groups). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of six methyl singlets at d 2.13, 1.38, 1.22, 1.15, 0.99 and 0.41, attributed to H3-23, H3-25, H3-26, H3-30, H3-28 and H3-27, respectively, (Table 1). The quinon- emethide moiety was characterized by a doublet at d 6.26 (1H, J ¼ 6:5 Hz), a singlet at d 6.41 (1H) and a doublet at d 6.94 (1H, J ¼ 6:5 Hz) attributed to H-7, H-1 and H-6, respectively. The singlet at d 2.13, char- acteristic of a methyl group attached to a sp2 carbon (H3-23), corroborated the presence of a quinonemethide system. Further oxygenated functional groups were as- sumed to be hydroxyl and ester on the basis of NMR spectral analysis. The 13C NMR, gHMBC and gHMQC spectra (Table 2) showed the presence of 30 carbons in 1. In the 13C NMR spectrum two carbonyl carbon signals (d 178.2 and d 178.3) attributed to C-29 and C-2, re- spectively, six methyl carbons (d 38.1, 32.2, 24.0, 21.6, 19.0 and 10.1), six methylene carbons (d 38.1, 36.1, 33.5, 30.8, 29.5 and 28.2), four methine carbons (d 134.0, 119.5, 118.0 and 46.1), 10 quaternary carbons (d 169.7, 164.6, 146.0, 127.3, 117.2, 44.5, 42.6, 42.4, 39.2 and 38.2), one methoxyl carbon (d 51.6) and one hydroxy- methine carbon (d 67.9) were observed. The assignments were based on gHMQC and gHMBC spectra and by comparison with published data on pristimerin (Guna- tilaka, 1989, 1996). The correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum from the singlet at d 0.99 (H3-28) to the hydroxymethine carbon at d 67.9 (Fig. 1) and the signals at d 36.1 (C-16), 38.1 (C-17) and 46.1 (C-18), conﬁrmed the attachment of the hydroxyl group at C- 22. The relative stereochemistry of H-22 was deduced by the coupling constant values (d 4.02, J22ax=21ax ¼ 11:0 Hz and J22ax=21eq ¼ 4:0 Hz), which corroborated the equa- torial orientation of the hydroxyl group. The ester group was conﬁrmed by a singlet at d 3.50 (3H) attributed to a methoxyl portion of the ester group at C-29, which was conﬁrmed by means of correlation of the methyl group at d 1.15 (C-30) with the carbonyl carbon of the ester group at d 178.2 (C-29) observed in the gHMBC spec- trum (Fig. 1). The structure of 1 was determined as 22b- hydroxypristimerin. Cognatine (2), isolated as a pale yellow amorphous solid, was shown to have the molecular formula C31H38O7 by means of analysis of ESI/MS data, ele- mental analysis and 13C NMR spectral data. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxyl group at 3438 cm�1 and carbonyl groups at 1718 and 1643 cm�1. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of two singlets at d 6.85 (1H), attributed to H-1 and at d 6.00 (1H) assigned to H-7. Also, two methoxyl groups signals at d 3.73 and 3.74 (3H, each) were ob- served, which were characterized as methoxyl groups attached to C-3 and belonging to the ester group at C- Table 1 1H NMR spectral data of compounds 1 and 2 [500 MHz, d (ppm), multiplicity, J (Hz), CDC13] Position 1 2 1 6.41 (s) 6.85 (s) 6 6.94 (d, J6;7 ¼ 6; 5 Hz) – 7 6.26 (d, J7;6 ¼ 6; 5 Hz) 6.00 (s) 21 – 4.95 (s) 22 4.02 (dd, J22ax;21ax ¼ 11:0 Hz and J22ax;21eq ¼ 4:0 Hz) – 23 2.13 (s) 2.67 (s) 25 1.38 (s) 1.33 (s) 26 1.22 (s) 1.72 (s) 27 0.41 (s) 0.90 (s) 28 0.99 (s) 1.38 (s) 30 1.15 (s) 0.95 (s) OCH3 at C-29 3.50 (s) 3.74 (s) OCH3 at C-3 – 3.73 (s) 1978 A.H.

Other singlets integrating for 3H each were observed at d 2.67, assigned to a methyl group on aro- matic ring (H3-23), at d 1.72 assigned to one methyl group on double bond (C-26) and at d 1.38, 1.33, 0.95 and 0.90, corresponding to tertiary methyl groups (H3- 28, H3-25, H3-30 and H3-27, respectively). The analysis of the 13C NMR (Table 2), gHMQC and gHMBC spectral data indicated the presence of three carbonyl carbons at d 214.0, 185.8 and 175.2 attributed to C-22, C-6 and C-29, respectively, six methyl groups at d 27.6, 23.9, 22.5, 21.7, 15.1 and 13.7, attributed to C-25, C-27, C-28, C-26, C-23 and C-30, respectively, two vinylic carbons at d 134.7 and 125.9, two vinylic carbons conjugated to carbonyl groups at d 160.1 and 129.3, four methylene carbons at d 38.0, 37.1, 35.8 and 34.2, one methine carbon at d 46.2, ﬁve quaternary aromatic carbons at d 151.7, 151.2, 144.7, 134.0 and 122.4.

Jeller et al. / Phytochemistry 65 (2004) 1977–1982 1979 nals for four quaternary carbons (d 42.2, 40.7, 48.8 and 50.3), two sp3 carbons belonging to methoxyl groups (d 52.7 and 61.7) and one hydroxymethine carbon at d 74.3 were also observed. The gHMBC data (Fig. 2) showed the correlation of the singlet at d 6.85 (H-l) to the carbons at d 151.7 (C-2), d 144.7 (C-3), d 122.4 (C-5) and d 42.2 (C-9) and the singlet at d 6.00 (H-7) to the carbons at d 134.7 (C-4), d 122.4 (C-5) and d 42.2 (C-9) corroborating unambigu- ously the assignments of H-l and H-7. Besides, the signal at d 6.85 (1H, H-l) was correlated to d 110.1 (C-l) and the signal at d 6.00 (1H, H-7) showed correlation to d 129.3 (C-7) in the HMQC spectrum. The correlation between the methoxy signal at d 3.73 and the carbon signal at d 144.7 conﬁrmed the position of the methoxyl group at C-3. Also, the gHMBC spectrum showed cor- relations from the signal at d 1.22 (H3-26) to signals at d 125.9 and d 134.7, assigned to carbons C-14 and C-15, respectively. The signal at d 1.38 (H3-28) showed cor- relations with the carbon signal at d 38.0 (C-16) and also with the carbonyl signal at d 214.0, which conﬁrmed the position of one carbonyl group at C-22. An additional correlation from the methyl signal at d 1.72 (H3-26) to the carbon at d 38.0 (C-16) corroborated the attribution of the other carbonyl at C-6, with the chemical shift at d 185.6 being characteristic of an a,b-unsaturated car- bonyl and C-16, a methylenic carbon. The remaining gHMBC correlations from H3-30 (d 0.95) to C-19 (d 34.2) and the hydroxymethine carbon at C-21 (d 74.3), besides correlation of methoxyl hydrogens at d 3.74 with the carbonyl signal at C-29 (d 175.2), established the proposed structure 2 for cognatine. The known compounds pristimerin (3), maytenin (4), 22b-hydroxymaytenin (5) and 20a-hydroxymaytenin (6) were identiﬁed by comparison with published data (Gunatilaka, 1989; Gunatilaka, 1996; Dhanabalasing- ham et al., 1996; Furlan et al., 1990). Compounds 7–9 had been previously isolated from Orthosphenia mexi- cana (Gonz�alez et al., 1983), but a number of incon- sistencies were found regarding the assignments of published 13C NMR data. The analysis of 2D NMR spectra allowed accurate assignment of 13C NMR signals mostly based on gHMQC and gHMBC experiments. The spectrophotometric assay using DPPH indicated a prominent free radical scavenging activity for some of the isolated quinonemethide triterpenes (Fig. 3). The stable free radical DPPH has an absorption maximum at 517 nm, which decreases upon reduction through reaction with an antioxidant compound. The free radical scavenging activity of quinonemethide triterpenes is mostly due to the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety with extended conjugation through ring B, e.g. in compounds 1 and 3–6 or B–D, e.g. in compounds 7–9. These fea- tures stabilize the quinonemethide free radical promptly formed after loss of one radical hydrogen, donated to the DPPH. The more extended conjugations of triter- penes 7–9 account for their higher free radical scav- enging abilities (ca. 45% inhibition at 60 lM) when compared to compounds 1–6 (less than 30% inhibition at 60 lM). The phenolic triterpene 2 exhibited the lowest activity (18% at 60 lM) probably due to the lack of conjugation through rings B–D. The free radical scav- enging ability of the quinonemethide triterpenes and a standard compound rutin (66% inhibition at 60 lM) are due to catechol moiety present in the B ring of rutin the C2–C3 double bond (van Acker et al., 1996). The syn- thetic antioxidant BHT (11% inhibition at 60 lM) ex- hibited the weakest antiradical activity as expected due to its slow reaction rate with DPPH (Bondet et al., 1997). 3. Experimental 3.1. Plant material Root barks of C. cognatum (Hippocrateaceae) were collected at Universidade Federal de Goi�as, Goi^ania, GO and identiﬁed by Dr J�ulio Ant^onio Lombardi (Departamento de Bot^anica do Institute de Ci^encias Biol^ogicas – Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, UFMG). A voucher specimen (No. 19797) is deposited at Herbarium of Institute de Ci^encias Biol^ogicas – UFG, Goi�as. 3.2. Instrumentation and chromatography Silica gel (Merck, 230–400 and 70–230 mesh) were used for CC unless otherwise stated and solvents were distilled prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were re- corded on a Varian INOVA spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as reference. HPLC separations were performed using a Shimadzu LC-10AS. Preparative HPLC separation were performed on a Varian PROSTAR, using a reversed phase column (Phenomenex-Luna C18, 21.2 � 250 mm, 0 20 40 60 80 100 5 10 20 40 80 100 concentration (µM) (Ao-A)/Ao (%) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 rutin BHT Fig. 3.

ESI-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elemental Analyser 2400 CHN Perkin–Elmer. 3.3. Extraction and isolation of constituents Dried and powdered root barks of C. cognatum (690.0 g) were extracted with EtOH. The resulting EtOH extract was ﬁltered and concentrated in vacuo to aﬀord a brown gum (210.6 g), which was submitted to liquid– liquid partitioning. The CH2C12 soluble part of the EtOH extract was concentrated in vacuo (25.5 g), sub- mitted to a silica gel column (600 g, 70–230 mesh) eluted with a hexane/EtOAc gradient, yielding 41 fractions (A1–A41). Fraction A9–A11 (1.48 g) was submitted to a ﬂash silica gel CC (230–400 mesh), eluted with a hexane/ EtOAc gradient resulting in 32 fractions (B1–B41). Fraction B10–B14 (0.154 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] yielding compound 3 (55 mg). Fraction B18–B21 (0.085 g) was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1)] aﬀording compound 4 (34 mg). Fraction A16–A17 (3.55 g) was submitted to ﬂash silica gel CC (70–230 mesh), eluted with hexane/EtOAc gra- dient, resulting in 46 fractions (C1–C46). Fraction C19– C23 (0.221 g) was submitted to a reversed phase prep. HPLC [MeOH:H2O (7:3), k ¼ 420 nm, 10 ml min�1] to aﬀord compounds 1 (63 mg) and 8 (65 mg). Fraction A22–A26 (2.46 g) was subjected to a ﬂash silica gel CC eluted with hexane/EtOAc gradient, resulting in 77 fractions (D1–D77). Fraction D23–D27 was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1), AcOH 0.05%] aﬀording compounds 5 (13 mg) and 6 (23 mg). Fraction D17–D22 was submitted to prep. TLC [hexane:EtOAc (4:1), AcOH 0,05%, three elutions] and further puriﬁed by reversed phase prep. HPLC [MeOH:H2O (7:3), k ¼ 420 nm, 10 mL min�1] aﬀording compounds 7 (18 mg) and 2 (4 mg). 3.4. Radical scavenging activity on DPPH radical Radical scavenging activity was assayed according to the Blois method (Blois, 1958). The free radical scav- enging capacities of quinonemethide triterpenes and standard compounds rutin and BHT were evaluated based on their ability to reduce the free radical already assigned (DPPH). Each compound (1 mg) was solubi- lized in methanol (10 ml) to yield a stock solution. Several dilutions of each compound from 5 to 100 lM were then prepared in MeOH and to each sample a solution of DPPH (0.004%) was added. Absorbance at 517 nm was determined after 30 min on a Milton Roy 20D spectrophotometer and the percentage of activity was calculated (see Fig. 3). 3.5. 22b-Hydroxypristimerin (1) Amorphous solid.
