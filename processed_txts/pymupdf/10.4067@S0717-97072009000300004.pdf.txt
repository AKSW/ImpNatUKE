(Received: July 22, 2008 - Accepted: May 13, 2009) ABSTRACT As part of our ongoing bioprospecting studies on secondary metabolites in plants of Cerrado and Atlantic Rain Forest of São Paulo State (Brazil), we describe  the identification of triterpenes and sterols present in the hexane extracts and foliar epicuticular wax of Pterogyne nitens Tulasne (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae)  using high resolution gas chromatography. Compounds detected in these extracts include β-amyrin (1), taraxerol acetate (2), lupenone (3), β-amyrenone (4),  germanicone (5), campesterol (6), stigmasterol (7), and β-sitosterol (8). The method reported herein is shown to be a rapid, sensitive and reproducible tool for  describing triterpenes and sterols present in non-polar extracts. Keywords: Pterogyne nitens;  Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae; sterols; triterpenes; gas chromatography. INTRODUCTION Nature is an extremely rich source of highly diverse and innovative chemical  structures, which have played a significant role in the process of drug discovery  and design.1,2 In this context, there has been renewed alert in the rapid rate of  plant species extinction3, which reduces the time left to explore the remaining  resources of natural compounds. Urgent efforts are thus mandatory to speed  up collection and selection of plants for chemical-biological investigation and  possible conservation for future beneficial use of humankind.4 Among legumes of the Caesalpinioideae subfamily, Pterogyne nitens Tul.  popularly named “bálsamo”, “cocal”, “amendoim-bravo”, “yvi-raró” is the sole  member of the genus, and has been submitted to a strong anthropogenic impact,  which has led to its numerical population retraction, and classification into  the category of species in critical risk. It is found only in small non-protected  areas in South America, and is therefore, subjected to the prompt possibility  of extinction5-7. Regarding ethnopharmacological information, this legume is  used for treatment of parasitic infestations, mainly Ascaris lumbricoides.8 In  previous chemical reports, the chromatographic fractionation of the extract  from the leaves furnished cytotoxic guanidine alkaloids.9,10 Recent works on  the leaves and fruits led to a series of flavonols and flavones which exhibited  myeloperoxidase inhibitory and radical scavenging properties.11-14 In this work, we have employed high-resolution gas chromatography  (HRGC) to investigate the sterols and triterpenes from P. nitens, as a promising  tool to our bioprospecting activities within program BIOTA-FAPESP  (The Biodiversity Virtual Institute Program), which aims to inventory and  characterize the biodiversity of São Paulo State, and explore mechanisms for  its conservation and sustainable use. EXPERIMENTAL Plant material The leaves, stems, fruits and flowers of Pterogyne nitens were collected  in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil, in May 2003 and  identified by Dr. Inês Cordeiro (IBt-SMA). A voucher specimen (SP204319)  has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (São Paulo, SP,  Brazil). Preparation of the hexane extracts and foliar epicuticular wax Each plant material (50.0 g) was dried at 40 oC, powdered and extracted  exhaustively at room temperature with hexane (200 mL, 5 days x 3). The  solvent was removed under reduced pressure in a rotatory evaporator (< 40 oC)  to yield dried hexane extracts from leaves (3.1 g), stems (1.8 g), fruits (2.5 g)  and flowers (1.7 g). Fresh leaves (100.0 g) were individually dipped for ca. 5 s into 50 mL  dichloromethane. After filtration to remove plant debris, the solvent was  evaporated using a stream of gaseous nitrogen affording a foliar epicuticular  wax (87.0 mg) which was immediately analyzed by HRGC. Samples clean-up Samples of each crude extract (10 mg) were dissolved in chloroform (3.0  mL) and percolated through chromatographic column over celite:norit (1:1,  100.0 mg) + silica gel (200.0 mg) eluted with chloroform (10.0 mL). After  evaporation to dryness at room temperature, the eluate was dissolved in hexane: ethyl acetate (7:3) and analyzed by HRGC in three replicates. Gas chromatographic conditions All the extracts were analyzed by HRGC on a Varian model CP-3800 gas  chromatograph equipped with split injector [initial splitless; 0.75 min (1:50);  2.00 min (1:20)] at 260 ºC, and flame ionization detector at 310 ºC for SPB- 5 column and 290 ºC for SPB-50 column. The injected volume was 2.0 µL.  SPB-50 (cross-linked 50% phenyl-methyl-siloxane, 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25  µm) and SPB-5 (cross-linked 5% phenyl-methyl-siloxane, 30 m x 0.25 mm x  0.25 µm) capillary columns were employed. In the case of SPB-50, the column  temperature was 280 ºC (isotherm), whereas for SPB-5, a column temperature  program was employed in which the initial temperature was 250 ºC, held for 12  min, followed by a temperature increase of 6 ºC min-1 to 280 ºC, then held for  additional 30 min. Nitrogen was employed as carrier gas at an average linear  velocity of 1 mL/min. Triterpenes and sterols were identified by comparison of  the relative retention (RR) of the samples with the RR of the standard sterols  and triterpenes. Cholesterol was used as internal standard. Authentic standard sterols and triterpenes Triterpenes and steroids used as standards were previously isolated from  Lauraceae and Rubiaceae species, including Alibertia macrophylla, A. sessilis,  Licaria rodriguesii, L.  subbulata, and Aniba parviflora. Their molecular  structures were identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS techniques.15-17 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Hexane extracts from leaves, fruits, flowers and stems of P. nitens,  in addition to the foliar epicuticular wax were analyzed by HRGC using a  method which does not require pre-derivatizations. The GC-FID method used  in this study employed two different columns: SPB-5 and SPB-50, which  were used due to their low polarity, inertness towards organic compounds  and high temperature limit. Such features make them ideal for the analysis of  underivatized semi-volatile plant extracts. The chromatogram obtained in SPB-50 column for the hexane extract  from P. nitens stems evidences good resolution of peaks and thus proper  identification of major components by comparison of RR (relative retention)  values with those of authentic samples (Figure 1A). The presence of each  triterpene or sterol was additionally confirmed by co-injection with authentic  standards to avoid misclassifications due to overlapping of retention zones. e-mail: dhsilva@iq.unesp.br J.

(+) presence of the compound; (-) absence of the  compound. Our results indicate that β-sitosterol (8) is present in all the analyzed extracts. Additional widely occurring sterols: campesterol (6) and stigmasterol (7),  were also characterized in all analyzed hexane extracts, except from the leaves.  The pentacyclic triterpenes β-amyrin (1) and lupenone (3) were detected in  the stems and flowers, whereas germanicone (5) was identified in the leaves  and stems; and β-amyrenone (4) was detected in the flowers extract. Further  GC-FID analyses of foliar epicuticular wax showed the presence of 1, 5 and,  taraxerol acetate (2). These results clearly demonstrate that the hexane extracts  from stems and flowers present higher chemodiversity than the others. On  the other hand their chemical profile indicated common major constituents  concerning sterols and triterpenes in the analyzed samples evidencing great  similarity among the studied plant part extracts. Altogether, these results corroborate differences in the secondary  metabolites production by different plant tissues, which can be relevant from  the point of view of the chemical interface between plants and the surrounding  environment.18 In this context, several studies indicated variable production  of secondary metabolites by medicinal plants.19 Zangerl and Bazzaz reported  different levels of furanocoumarins from Pastinaca sativa (Apiaceae) leaves and  roots.20 Likewise, Rees described flowers of Hypericum hirsutum (Clusiaceae)  contain five to ten times more hypericin that the leaves.21 Considering that  young leaves and other growing plant parts are generally better protected by  secondary compounds than mature tissues, young leaves of rosette plants of  Cynoglossum officinale (Boraginaceae) were found to contain up to 53 times  higher levels of pyrrolizidine alkaloids than older leaves.22  In the case of non-polar extracts, bioactivity has been often associated  with complex mixtures of triterpenoid and/or steroid compounds23-26. However,  no further analysis/identification of the mixture components is subsequently  performed in most cases due to two reasons: Firstly, traditional phytochemical  procedures, which include isolation of the components from isomeric  mixtures, may be tedious, time-consuming and relatively expensive. Secondly,  due to their structural complexity the analysis of triterpenes and sterols by  spectroscopic techniques has been shown to be difficult in many cases. Gas  chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has emerged as  the best technique for characterization of low-polarity compounds, including  triterpenes, sterols, glycerols, waxes, and derivatized fatty acids. However, this  hyphenated analytical technique is still inaccessible to many research groups  around the world. On the other hand, GC is more readily available and might  also be employed as a preliminary procedure for rapid, simple, and relatively  cheap characterization of non-polar compounds from plant extracts, including  epicuticular waxes. The present phytochemical screening using HRGC showed  to be reliable and useful for the identification of triterpenes and sterols in  complex matrices such as hexane extracts and foliar epicuticular wax from P.  nitens (Figure 2). Other interesting applications of this technique include the  selection of plant extracts containing bioactive non-polar compounds for further  phytochemical and pharmacological investigations, which may represent a  crucial step in bioprospecting studies and corroborates its importance as a tool  for conducting phytochemical studies.
