The structure of compound 1 was elucidated by interpretation of spectral data, including ES-MS. Compound 1 showed antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaero- spermum. Chemical studies carried out on Piperaceae species have revealed the occurrence of essential oils, pyrones, lignoids, and unsaturated amides.1 Some of these compounds have generated interest as a result of their potent insecticidal properties.2 In the course of our ongoing search for bioactive compounds from Brazilian flora,3 we have investigated the CH2Cl2 extract from leaves of Piper hispidum H. B. K. (Piperaceae) employ- ing two preliminary bioassays: anticancer activity based on growth evaluation of genetically engineered mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae4,5 and antifungal effect utilizing direct bioautography with the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum.6 The extract exhibited moderate and nonselective activity on all the mutant strains tested, suggesting the presence of antifungal agents rather than potential anticancer agents. In fact, it did show activity against the fungus C. sphaerosper- mum (MIC 1096 µg). Subsequent bioactive-guided fractionation led to the isolation of a new amide N-[7- (3′,4′-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(Z),4(Z)-heptadienoyl]pyr- rolidine (1) and the known amides N-[5-(3′,4′-methyl- enedioxyphenyl)-2(E)-pentadienoyl]pyrrolidine and N-[2- (3′,4′-methylenedioxy, 6-methoxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenoyl]- pyrrolidine. Of these, the amide 1 exhibited antifungal activity. Compound 1 has a molecular formula of C18H21NO3 as determined by electrospray mass spectral analysis (ES-MS) and 13C NMR data. The UV spectrum dis- played an absorption at 262 nm, indicating the presence of a conjugated dienamide system. The IR spectrum exhibited bands at 1640 (conjugated carbonyl group), 1620 (conjugated double bond), and 925 (methylene- dioxyphenyl group) cm-1. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 1 revealed signals for 3′,4′-methylenedioxyphenyl protons (δ 5.86) and signals related to four olefinic protons. Two of the olefinic protons showed signals at δ 5.77 (1H, d, J ) 11.4 Hz) and 6.37 (1H, t, J ) 11.4 Hz) assigned to protons H-2 and H-3, respectively, corroborating the R,�-unsaturated carbonyl system. Signals at δ 7.30 (dd, J ) 11.4 Hz) and 5.94 (dd, J ) 11.4, 7.0 Hz) were assigned to the protons of the second double bond conjugated to the first one. Most of the amides isolated from Piper species possess the (E,E) configuration in the double bonds of the side chain; however, this compound differed from the normal skeleton judging by the coupling constant observed for protons H-2, H-3, H-4, and H-5. In compounds with (E) configuration, the coupling constants are normally J2,3 ) 15.0 Hz and J4,5 ) 15.0 Hz,7,8 while in the case of amide 1, these values were observed at J2,3 ) 11.4 Hz and J4,5 ) 11.4 Hz, indicating that the two double bonds possess the (Z,Z) configuration. The assignments of these protons were established by analysis of the 1H- 1H COSY spectrum (Figure 1) and also by irradiation of the H-2, which caused the signal of H-3 to collapse to a doublet. On the other hand, the irradiation at the frequency of H-3 transformed the signal of H-2 into a singlet. The proposed stereochemistry was also cor- roborated by the signal of H-4 (δ 7.30, γ position), which showed significant deshielding when compared to the (E) configuration7 caused by its proximity to the carbo- nyl group (Figure 1). The presence of a benzylic carbon in 1 was supported by the appearance of a fragment ion at m/z 135 in its MS. The assignments of methylenic protons H-7 (δ 2.59, 2H) and H-6 (δ 2.42, 2H) were confirmed by DQ-COSY spectrum, which showed cor- relation between such protons to each other. Additional correlation between proton H-6 and methine proton at H-5 (δ 5.94, 1H) was also observed. The 13C NMR data * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The lowfield region of the spectrum exhibited an amide carbonyl at δ 165.6, 10 olefinic and/or aromatic carbons and a methylenedioxyphenyl group at δ 100.7. The assignments of the signals for the aromatic carbons based on the comparison with data described for pip- erdardine7 indicated that a 3′,4′-methylenedioxyphenyl moiety is present in 1. Such amides with cis geometry are quite rare in nature. To date, only two cinnamoyl pyrrolidine amides showing a cis double bond at C-2 and C-3 have been reported by Sehgal et al.9 and Kiuchi et al.10 N-[5-(3′,4′-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-2(E)-pentadienoyl]- pyrrolidine (2) has the molecular formula C16H19NO3 by analysis of the MS data. Its 1H NMR spectrum was identical to that published for the same compound previously isolated from Piper nigrum.10 Its 13C NMR data (Table 1) is being published for the first time. N-[2- (3′,4′-Methylenedioxy, 6′-methoxyphenyl)-2(Z)-propenoyl]- pyrrolidine, a cinnamoyl pyrrolidine amide, was previ- ously isolated from P. peepuloides and was identified by comparison of its spectral data.11 The antifungal activity of amide 1 was evaluated by means of direct bioautography in a TLC bioassay12 and the centerpoint-inoculation-disk assay.13 The MIC for 1 was found to be 8.0 µg. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Si gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatogra- phy unless otherwise stated, and solvents were redis- tilled prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 200 and 50 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 as a solvent and TMS as reference. IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet spectrometer. ES-MS were recorded on a VG Platform II spectrometer. HPLC separations were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10AS using a reversed-phase column (Waters Nova Pack, C18; 3.9 × 150 mm) eluted with MeOH-H2O (6:4), flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and detection at 254 nm. Plant Material. P. hispidum H. B. K. (Piperaceae) leaves were collected in Parque Estadual do Morro do Diabo, Teodoro Sampaio, SP, and classified by Dr. Waldir Mantovani. The voucher specimen is deposited at Departamento de Ecologia, Instituto de Biocieˆncias- USP. Bioassays. The experimental screening methods utilizing mutant yeast strains of S. cerevisiae have been described elsewhere.4,5 The IC12 values refer to the concentration in µg/mL required to produce an inhibi- tion zone 12 mm in diameter around a 100-µL well during a 48-h incubation period at 37 °C. The micro- organism used in the antifungal assay, C. sphaerosper- mum (Pemzig) SPC 491, has been maintained at Insti- tuto de Botaˆnica. Antifungal Assay. Dilutions containing 750-1500 µg of crude extract and 100, 50, 10, 1, 0.1 µg of pure compound were applied on precoated TLC plates. TLC plates were developed with hexane-EtOAc (7:3). The chromatogram was sprayed with a spore suspension of C. sphaerospermum in glucose and salt solution12 and incubated for 72 h in darkness in a moistened chamber at 25 °C. Clear inhibition zones appeared against a dark background, indicating the minimal amount of 1 (10 µg) required for inhibition of fungal growth on TLC plate. Nystatin (5 µg) and miconazole (1 µg) were used as positive controls. Extraction and Isolation. The dried, powdered leaves of P. hispidum (3.1 g) were extracted three times at room temperature with CH2Cl2 (150 mL each) in the course of 2 days. The resulting CH2Cl2 extract was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford 1.84 g of a green gum. Part of this extract (1.69 g) was applied to a Si gel column (300 g) and eluted with hexane contain- Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR Spectral Data for Compounds 1 and 2 (δ in ppm, CDCl3) 1 2 position δH [m, J (Hz)]a δCb,c δH [m, J (Hz)]a δCb,c 1 165.6 (s) 164.7 (s) 2 5.77 (1H, d, J2,3 ) 11.4) 118.1 (d) 6.03 (d, J2,3 ) 14.8) 122.3 (d) 3 6.37 (1H, t, J3,2 and 3,4 ) 11.4) 140.4 (d) 6.85 (dt, J3,2 ) 15.0, J3,4 ) 7.0) 144.2 (d) 4 7.30 (1H, dd, J4,3 ) 11.4) 127.9 (d) 2.38 (m) 34.4 (t) 5 5.94 141.6 (d) 2.56 34.5 (t) (1H, dt, J4,5 ) 11.4, J5,6 ) 7.0) (t, J5,4 ) 7.0) 6 2.42 (m) 34.9 (t) 7 2.59 (t, J7,6 ) 7.0) 35.0 (t) 1′ 135.4 (s) 135.0 (s) 2′ 6.54 (1H, d, J2′,6′ ) 1.6) 108.1 (d) 6.58 (d, J2′,6′ ) 1.6) 108.1 (d) 3′ 145.6 (s) 145.4 (s) 4′ 147.5 (s) 147.5 (s) 5′ 6.65 (1H, d, J5′,6′ ) 7.8) 108.8 (d) 6.62 (d, J5′,6′ ) 7.8) 108.8 (d) 6′ 6.59 121.1 (d) 6.59 121.2 (d) (1H, dd, J6′,5′ ) 7.8 and J6′,2′ ) 1.6) (dd, J6′,5′ ) 7.8, J6′,2′ ) 1.6) 1′′ 3.47 (2H, t, J1′′,2′′ ) 7.0) 45.5 (t) 3.44 (t, J1′′,2′′ ) 6.5) 45.8 (t) 2′′ 1.84 26.2 (t) 1.84 (m) 26.1 (t) (2H, dt, J2′′,1′′ ) 7.0 and J2′′,3′′ ) 7.3) 3′′ 1.84 24.3 (t) 1.84 (m) 24.3 (t) (2H, dt, J2′′,3′′ ) 7.3 and J3′′,4′′ ) 7.0) 4′′ 3.39 (2H, t, J4′′,3′′ ) 7.0) 46.8 (t) 3.37 (t, J4′′,3′′ ) 6.5) 46.5 (t) O-CH2-O 5.86 (s) 100.7 (t) 5.88 (s) 100.8 (t) a Measured at 200 MHz. b Measured at 50 MHz. c Multiplicities of carbons (in parentheses) determined by a DEPT experiment.
