These compounds have been isolated from various fungi. Chaetovir- idins were ﬁrst characterized from the soil strain C. globosum var. ﬂavo-viriade.8 Seven chaetoviridins have been reported to date: chaetoviridins A�F (1�6) and 40-epichaetoviridin A (8).8,9 Chaetoviridin A (1) inhibits tumor promotion by 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in a two-stage carcino- genesis model in mice.10 Tomoda et al.11 found that chaeto- viridins A (1) and B (2) inhibited cholesteryl ester transfer protein. Chaetoviridin A (1) showed antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of Pyricularia oryzae mycelia at 2.5 μg mL�1.8 Recently, Park et al.12 reported that chaetoviridins A (1) and B (2) also display inhibitory activity against the in vitro growth of Magnaporthe grisea (rice blast) and Pythium ultimum mycelia with MIC values of 1.23 and 33.3 μg mL�1, respectively. In addition, chaetoviridins A (1) and B (2) exhibited strong in vivo antifungal activity against M. grisea and Puccnicia recondite (wheat leaf rust). In this paper, we describe the isolation and structural elucida- tion of six new azaphilones (7, 9�13) along with six previously known azaphilones (1�5, 8).8,9 Structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic data, mainly 1D and 2D NMR. The structure previously reported for epi-chaetoviridin A has been revised and corrected to 8. In addition, the in vivo anti-infective activities of the isolated azaphilones (1�5, 7�13) were evalu- ated using the well-studied nematode Caenorhabditis elegans infected with the human opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. ’RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Cultured C. globosum produced the known chaetoviridins 1�5 and 88,9 and six new chaetoviridins: 50-epichaetoviridin A (7), 40-epichaetoviridin F (9), 12β-hydroxychaetoviridin C (10), and chaetoviridins G�I (11�13). The known chaetoviridins A�E (1�5) were identiﬁed by comparing their physical and spectroscopic data with literature values.8,9 The structure of chaetoviridin A (1) was conﬁrmed by single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis (Figure 1). The spectroscopic data of compound 8 (Supporting In- formation) were coincident with those published in the literature for epi-chaetoviridin A, reported as the C50 epimer of 1.9 The epimerization at C50 was proposed on the basis of no correlation between H-40 and H-50 in the NOESY spectrum, which had been observed in 1.9 We applied the Mosher method to unambigu- ously establish the orientation of the hydroxyl group at C50. The Received: February 7, 2011 ABSTRACT: Six new azaphilones, 50-epichaetoviridin A (7), 40-epichaetoviridin F (9), 12β-hydroxychaetoviridin C (10), and chaetoviridins G�I (11�13), and six known azaphilones, chaeto- viridins A�E (1�5) and 40-epichaetoviridin A (8), were isolated from the endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum cultivated in PDB medium for 21 days. The structure elucidation and the assignment of the relative conﬁgurations of the new natural products were based on detailed NMR and MS spectroscopic analyses. The structure of compound 1 was conﬁrmed by single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis. The absolute conﬁgurations of compounds 4, 7, 8, and 12 were determined using Mosher’s method. The antibiotic activity of the compounds was evaluated using an in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans infection model. 1183 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np200110f |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 1182–1187 Journal of Natural Products ARTICLE (R)- and (S)-MPA esters 8a and 8b were obtained by treatment of 8 with (R)- and (S)-MPA acids, respectively. Negative ΔδRS (δR � δS) values were found for H-40 and H-40CH3 (�0.102 and �0.314, respectively), while a positive ΔδRS value was found for H-60 (þ0.125). Following the MPA rules, these data indi- cated the R-conﬁguration for C50 in 8, which is identical to those described for 1. In addition, C40, C50, and C60 chemical shifts of 8 are shielded compared to the same carbons in 1, while in compound 7 C50 is deshielded compared to 1. These data suggested that compound 8 must be the 40-epimer, and not the 50-epimer, of chaetoviridin A (1), as proposed by Phonkerd et al.9 Therefore, the NMR data previously attributed to epi-chaetovir- idin A9 are in fact in agreement with the structure of 40-epich- aetoviridin A (8). The HRMS and 13C NMR spectra of compound 7 established its molecular composition as C23H25ClO6, a chaetoviridin A (1) isomer. Its 1H NMR spectrum showed signals very similar to those of 1 (Supporting Information). However, the upﬁeld shift of the signal corresponding to H-40CH3 and the deshielded chemical shift of the signal corresponding to H-60 suggested that this compound was 50-epichaetoviridin A (7). This hypothesis was conﬁrmed by the application of Mosher’s method. In accordance with this method, the corresponding Mosher diaster- eoisomeric esters 7a and 7b were obtained by treatment of 7 with (R)- and (S)-MPA acids, respectively. Positive ΔδRS (δR � δS) values were found for H-40 and H-40CH3 (þ0.101 and þ0.105, respectively), while a negative ΔδRS value was found for H-60 (�0.175). Following the MPA rules, these data indicated the S-conﬁguration for C50 in 7. The absolute conﬁgurations of C7 and C11 in chaetoviridin A (1) have been reported as S.8 Comparison of the NMR data of chaetoviridins B (2) and D (4) with those of 1 (Supporting Information) suggested the S-conﬁguration for both positions in both compounds. On the other hand, the relative conﬁguration of the C8 and C20 positions of chaetoviridins B (2) and D (4) was suggested to be cis by Takahashi et al.8 on the basis of the magnitude of the coupling constants (10.2 Hz in 2 and 9.7 Hz in 4). A qualitative analysis of the NOE experiments conﬁrmed this disposition. In particular, NOE interactions were detected be- tween H-7CH3, H-8, and H-20, supporting the S-conﬁguration for C8 and C20. Finally, the orientation of the secondary hydroxyl group at C12 in chaetoviridin D (4) was established by the application of the Mosher’s method. In accordance with this method, the corresponding Mosher diastereoisomeric esters 4a and 4b were obtained by treatment of 4 with (R)- and (S)-MTPA acids, respectively. The analysis by 1H NMR of the resulting esters 4a and 4b revealed negative ΔδSR (δS � δR) values for H-10, H-11, and H-11CH3 (�0.14, �0.062, and �0.086, respectively) and a positive ΔδSR value for H-13 (þ0.043). Following the MTPA rules, these data indicated the R-conﬁg- uration for C12 in chaetoviridin D (4). The absolute conﬁgura- tion of C50 could not be determined by this method, as it was not possible to derivatize the secondary alcohol linked to this carbon. On the basis of above data, the relative conﬁgurations of the chaetoviridins B and D were established as indicated in the structures of 2 and 4. Comparison of the NMR data of chaetoviridin C (3) with those of chaetoviridin A (1) (Supporting Information) suggested the S-conﬁguration for C7 and C11. The relative conﬁgurations of the C8�C20 positions of 3 were shown to be cis as in 2 and 4 by NOE diﬀerence spectra. In particular, NOE interactions were detected between H-7CH3, H-8, and H-20, supporting the S- conﬁguration for C8 and C20. The magnitude of the coupling constant between both protons H-40 and H-50 (9.1 Hz) was closer to that of 7 (8.1 Hz) than to that of 8 (3.0 Hz), suggesting Figure 1.

The hydrogen atoms are repre- sented as arbitrary radius spheres, and the ellipsoids of the non-H atoms are at the 50% probability level. 1184 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np200110f |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 1182–1187 Journal of Natural Products ARTICLE an anti-disposition between H-40 and H-50 and the S-conﬁguration for C40 and C50. From these results, the relative conﬁguration of chaetoviridin C was established as indicated in the structure of 3. Compound 9 was assigned the molecular formula C23H25ClO5, as deduced from the HREIMS. The 1H and 13C NMR data of 9 (Tables 1 and 2) indicated a structure similar to that of chaetoviridin F (6).9 However, there were some diﬀerences in chemical shifts between both compounds. In particular, the deshielded H-50, H-60, and 40-CH3 carbon signals suggested an opposite conﬁguration at C40 between both compounds. On the basis of these data, the structure of 9 was assigned as 40-epichaetoviridin F. The molecular formula of compound 10 (C23H27ClO7) was obtained by HREIMS and corroborated by 13C NMR data. The spectroscopic data of this compound were similar to those of 3 (Supporting Information). However, the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed a signal at δ 3.82 (m), which correlated in the COSY experiment with the signals corresponding to H-11 (δH 2.45) and H-13 (δH 1.19). Furthermore, the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) showed the presence of an additional signal corre- sponding to a carbon atom attached to a hydroxyl group (δC 70.8), which was connected to the signal at δ 3.82 (H-12) in the HSQC experiment. These data suggested that compound 10 is a hydroxyl derivative of 3 at C12. Due to the small amount obtained of this compound, it was not possible to determine the absolute conﬁguration of the hydroxyl group by Mosher’s method. However, the comparison of the NMR data of 10 (Tables 1 and 2) with those of chaetoviridin D (4) (Supporting In- formation) suggested the R-conﬁguration for C12. The conﬁg- urations of C7 and C11 were assigned to be S, similar to those reported for azaphilones.8 On the other hand, the relative conﬁgurations of the C8�C20 positions were shown to be cis as in 3 by NOE diﬀerence spectra. In particular, NOE interactions were detected between H-7CH3 and H-8 and between H-20 and H-8, supporting the S-conﬁguration for C8 and C20. Finally, the protons of the side chain at C20 showed chemical shifts very similar to those of 3 (Supporting Information). These data together with the magnitude of the coupling constant J40�50 (9.3 Hz) suggested an anti-disposition between H-40 and H-50 and the S-conﬁgura- tion for C40 and C50. On the basis of these data, the structure of 10 was assigned to 12β-hydroxychaetoviridin C. Chaetoviridin G (11) has the molecular formula C23H25ClO5 by HREIMS. Its 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) showed signals very similar to those of chaetoviridin E (5).9 However, the appearance of two doublets at δH 4.11 and 4.37, showing a vicinal coupling (J = 12.2 Hz), suggested that 11 was the 8,20-dihydro derivative of 5. The conﬁgurations at C7 and C11 were assigned to be S, similar to those reported for azaphilones.8 The conﬁgurations at C20�C8 were conﬁrmed to be cis by NOE Table 1. 1H NMR Data of Compounds 7 and 9�13 (400 MHz, CDCl3) δH, m (J in Hz) position 7 9 10 11 12 13 1 8.87, s 8.79, s 7.38, s 7.33, s 8.77, s 6.00, s 4 6.57, s 6.57, s 6.50, s 6.49, s 6.01, s 6.15, s 5 5.32, s 8 3.90, d (12.3) 4.11, d (12.2) 9 6.10, d (15.9) 6.08, d (15.9) 6.12, d (15.9) 6.03, d (15.8) 5.95, d (15.9) 6.02, d (15.4) 10 6.63, dd (8.2, 15.9) 6.61, dd (7.7, 15.9) 6.62, dd (8.2, 15.9) 6.50, dd (8.1, 15.7) 6.50, dd (8.2, 15.9) 6.65, dd (7.7, 15.4) 11 2.30, m 2.29, m 2.45, m 2.25, m 2.24, m 2.27, m 12 1.46, m 1.45, m 3.82, m 1.41, m 1.42, m 1.45, m 13 0.92, t (7.2) 0.91, t (7.2) 1.19, d (6.1) 0.88, t (7.3) 0.89, t (7.2) 0.91, t (7.2) 7-CH3 1.73, s 1.71, s 1.60, s 1.63, s 1.67, s 1.76, s 11-CH3 1.10, d (6.6) 1.10, d (6.6) 1.11, d (6.7) 1.07, d (6.7) 1.06, d (6.2) 1.09, d (6.2) 20 4.21, d (12.3) 4.37, d (12.2) 40 3.63, m 3.50, sext (6.7) 3.19, dq (6.7, 9.2) 3.65, m 3.31, m 50 3.90, m 1.84, m 1.37, m 3.82, m 6.80, br q (6.9) 3.87, dq (6.1, 6.7) 3.64, dq (6.2, 6.7) 60 1.33, d (6.6) 0.96, t (7.2) 1.24, d (6.1) 1.94, dd (1.1, 6.9) 1.16, d (6.7) 1.09, d (6.7) 40-CH3 1.02, d (7.2) 1.00, d (6.7) 1.05, d (6.7) 1.83, s 1.15, d (6.2) 1.11, d (6.2) Table 2. 13C NMR Data of Compounds 7 and 9�13 (100 MHz, CDCl3) δC, type position 7 9 10 11 12 13 1 152.2, C 151.7, C 146.2, C 147.0, C 152.7, C 96.1, C 3 157.1, CH 157.0, CH 157.2, CH 157.7, CH 155.4, CH 156.0, CH 4 105.3, CH 105.3, CH 105.2, CH 104.6, CH 107.9, CH 100.3, CH 4a 139.7, C 139.7, C 140.5, C 140.6, C 146.6, C 140.3, C 5 108.9, C 109.1, C 109.7, C 109.6, C 105.7, CH 125.2, C 6 183.1, C 183.3, C 184.4, C 184.7, C 190.1, C 185.8, C 7 87.9, C 87.5, C 83.4, C 83.5, C 87.7, C 86.2, C 8 164.8, C 164.1, C 42.5, CH 43.4, CH 165.2, C 72.9, C 8a 110.3, C 110.4, C 113.6, C 113.7, C 111.0, C 64.7, C 9 119.7, CH 119.7, CH 122.1, CH 120.1, CH 119.5, CH 121.7, CH 10 148.3, CH 148.1, CH 142.6, CH 145.8, CH 144.3, CH 147.9, CH 11 39.0, CH 39.0, CH 44.1, CH 38.8, CH 38.8, CH 38.8, CH 12 29.1, CH 29.1, CH 70.8, CH 29.1, CH 29.1, CH 29.2, CH 13 11.7, CH3 11.7, CH3 20.3, CH3 11.7, CH3 11.6, CH3 11.8, CH3 7-CH3 26.2, CH3 26.2, CH3 23.5, CH3 23.2, CH3 26.4, CH3 18.3, CH3 11-CH3 19.3, CH3 19.3, CH3 14.6, CH3 19.3, CH3 19.3, CH3 19.0, CH3 10 167.8, C 167.4, C 168.8, C 168.4, C 168.4, C 167.9, C 20 123.7, C 123.8, C 58.8, CH 51.6, CH 124.1, C 102.8, C 30 200.8, C 201.0, C 207.0, C 191.4, C 201.1, C 167.7, C 40 50.4, CH 45.1, CH 52.7, CH 137.5, C 50.8, CH 41.2, CH 50 71.7, CH 25.0, CH2 72.6, CH 144.8, CH 70.7, CH 69.8, CH 60 21.7, CH3 11.6, CH3 22.4, CH3 15.4, CH3 21.3, CH3 13.9, CH3 40-CH3 14.2, CH3 16.2, CH3 13.0, CH3 11.3, CH3 13.5, CH3 11.7, CH3 1185 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np200110f |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 1182–1187 Journal of Natural Products ARTICLE experiments. In particular, NOE interactions were detected between H-7CH3 and H-8 and between H-8 and H-20, which is only possible in the case of a β-disposition of the protons H-20 and H-8. Finally, the geometry of the double bond C40�C50 was also inferred on the basis of NOE experiments. Irradiation of the signal at δH 1.94 (H-60) led to enhancement of the signals at δH 1.83 (H-40CH3) and 6.80 (H-50). These results indicated that the conﬁguration of the C40�C50 double bond is E. The molecular formula C23H26O6 was assigned for chaetovir- idin H (12) by HREIMS. This compound corresponds to a dechlorinated derivative of chaetoviridin A (1). The 1H and 13C NMR data of this compound were similar to those of 1 (Suppor- ting Information), except for the presence of a signal at δH 5.31 (s). This singlet was connected to a sp2 carbon at δC 105.7 (C5) in the HSQC experiment and to three carbons at δC 111.0 (C8a), 107.9 (C4), and 87.7 (C7) in the HMBC experi- ment. The remaining signals in the 13C NMR spectrum along with the chemical shifts and coupling constants appearing in the 1H NMR spectrum were consistent with the structure shown for compound 12. The conﬁgurations of C7 and C11 were assigned as S by comparison of the NMR data of 12 with those of 1 (Supporting Information). On the other hand, the orientation of the secondary hydroxyl group was established by the application of the Mosher’s method. The (R)- and (S)-MPA esters 12a and 12b were obtained by treatment of 12 with (R)- and (S)-MPA acids, respectively. The negative value of ΔδRS (δR � δS) for H-40CH3 (�0.063) and the positive value of ΔδRS for H-60 (þ0.205) indicated the R-conﬁguration for C50 in chaetoviridin H (12). Finally, the conﬁguration at C40 was assigned as S on the basis of the magnitude of the coupling constant J40�50 (6.1 Hz) and carbon chemical shifts similar to 1. The molecular formula of compound 13 was established as C23H27ClO8 by HRESIMS, as well as 1H and 13C NMR data. NMR data for chaetoviridin I (13) were similar for the other isolated azaphilones except for the hydrogen at δ 6.00 (s, H-1), attached to the carbon at δ 96.1 in the HSQC experiment, suggesting a ketal group, and the quaternary carbons at δ 72.9 and 64.7. The hydrogen at δ 6.00 (s) showed a correlation in the HMBC experiment with a carbon at δ 156.0 (C-3). The methyl hydrogens at δ 1.76 (s, H-7CH3) showed correlations with the carbon at δ 72.9, and the hydrogen at δ 6.15 (s, H-4) showed a correlation with the carbon at δ 64.7. On the basis of these HMBC correlations C-8 and C-8a positions were assigned for the carbons at δ 72.9 and 64.7, respectively. These data indicate modiﬁcations at the 1, 8, and 8a positions for the tricyclic moiety compared with the other azaphilones. Another diﬀerence for 13 was the absence of a ketone carbon at δ 191.4�207.0, which is characteristic of the related azaphilones bearing the side chain at C-20. The correlation between the methyl hydrogens at δ 1.11 (d, 40-CH3) and the carbon at δ 167.7, not previously observed for the other compounds, suggested this carbon at δ 167.7 as C-30. Compound 13 could be produced in acidic conditions through the cyclization of the hydroxyl group attached to C30 at the C1, producing the dihydropyran ring of chaetoviridin 13 (Figure 2). The isolated compounds were tested in an in vivo pathogeni- city assay that involves the infection of C. elegans with Enter- ococcus faecalis.13 Using this assay the possibilities of discovering new antibacterial agents, or even prodrugs that need in vivo activation, is higher than traditional in vitro antibacterial assays. In this assay, the nematodes are transferred from their normal laboratory food, Escherichiacolistrain OP50, to a lawn of E. faecalis strain MMH594 to establish an infection and subsequently to modiﬁed liquid brain-heart infusion medium in 96-well microtiter plates. E. faecalis causes a lethal infection in the C. elegans intestine, and the end point of the assay is dead worms. None of the compoundsshowedsigniﬁcantabilitytopromotenematodesurvival. Thus, six new azaphilones together with six known azaphi- lones have been identiﬁed from the endophyte C. globosum. C. globosum from diﬀerent biomes has already been reported as proliﬁc producers of bioactive compounds. Other related, new cytotoxic azaphilone derivatives have been isolated from marine ﬁsh-derived C. globosum.14�19 A diﬀerent endophytic C. globosum strain produced the chemokine receptor CCR-5 inhibitor, with potential as an anti-HIV agent.20 ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures.

HPLC was performed with a Hitachi/Merck L-7100 apparatus equipped with a differential refractometer detector (RI-L7490) and an Intel Pentium computer for analytical system control, data collection, and processing (software Borwin). Purification by means of HPLC was carried out with a silica gel column (LIChroCART 250/10 LIChrospher SI60, 10 μm, 1 cm wide, 25 cm long, or LIChroCART 250/4 LIChrospher SI60, 5 μm, 0.4 cm wide, 25 cm long). TLC was performed on Merck Kiesegel 60 F254, 0.25 mm thick. Si gel (Merck) type 9385 was used for column chromatography. Fungal Material. The fungus was isolated from the leaves of Viguiera robusta and identified on the basis of its rDNA sequence as previously reported.6 A voucher specimen has been deposited at “Laborat�orio de Química de Micro-Organismos”, FCFRP, USP. The strain is maintained in both sterile water and silica gel (6�12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated) at 10 �C. Culture Conditions. The general procedure adopted for cultiva- tion of the microorganism followed the methodology described by Park et al.12 C. globosum was grown in 40 Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL) containing 200 mL of potato dextrose broth (PDB). Each flask was inoculated with 6 mycelium plugs (1 cm diameter each) from a 7-day-old culture grown on PDA agar and then incubated for 21 days at 25 �C on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm. Extraction and Isolation. The culture broth (8 L) was separated from the mycelium by vacuum filtration and partitioned with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) three times. The mycelium was extracted by macera- tion with EtOAc. The organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the EtOAc extracts were combined after TLC analysis. The crude combined EtOAc extract, a yellow oil (3.50 g), was separated by means of column chromatography using silica gel 60 eluted with n-hexane/ EtOAc (7:3), EtOAc/MeOH (1:1), and MeOH 100%, yielding eight fractions. Subfraction 4 yielded compound 1 (1.87 g). Fraction 3 (89 mg) was subjected to HPLC using a LiChroCART 250-10�LiChrospher Si 60 (10 μm) column eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (7:3) at a flow rate of 3 mL min�1, yielding two subfractions. Subfraction 3.1 (62.4 mg) was submitted to HPLC purification in a normal-phase column (LiChroCART 250-4�LiChrospher Si 60, 5 μm) using n-hexane/EtOAc (4:1) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 3 mL min�1 to yield 5 (44 mg) and 11 (16 mg). Fraction 5 (80 mg) was also submitted to both HPLC purification procedures described for fraction 3. In the first HPLC step fraction 5 yielded two subfractions. In the second step subfraction 5.1 (28 mg) yielded 9 (22 mg). Fraction 6 (270 mg) was also submitted to the same first HPLC purification procedure described for fraction 3 to give five subfractions. Subfractions 2�5 correspond to compounds 3 (32 mg), 7 (12 mg), 8 (25 mg), and 2 (141 mg), respectively. Fraction 7 (501 mg) was subjected to silica gel 60 column chromatography eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (2:3) and EtOAc 100%, yielding six subfrac- tions. Subfraction 7.1 (65 mg) was subjected to normal-phase HPLC (LiChroCART 250-10�LiChrospher Si 60, 10 μm) with n-hexane/EtOAc (3:2) as mobile phase at a flowrate of 3 mL min�1, yielding 12(32 mg) and 13 (11 mg). Subfraction 7.5 (88 mg) was also subjected to normal-phase HPLC using the same conditions used for purification of fraction 1, except for n-hexane/EtOAc (1:4) used as mobile phase, yielding four subfrac- tions. Subfraction 7.5.1 (6 mg) yielded 10 (4 mg) after purification in normal-phase HPLC (LiChroCART 250-4�LiChrospher Si 60, 5 μm, eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc (2:3) at flow rate of 1 mL min�1), subfraction 7.5.2 (26 mg) yielded 4 after crystallization, and subfraction 7.5.3 (12 mg) also yielded 4 (total of 24 mg) after normal-phase HPLC purification (LiChroCART 250-4�LiChrospher Si 60, 5 μm, eluted with n-hexane/ EtOAc (4:1) at flow rate of 1 mL min�1). 50-Epichaetoviridin A (7): orange, amorphous solid; [R]D 20� þ40 (c 0.002, CHCl3); UV (CHCl3) λmax nm (log ε) 307 (0.66), 367 (0.53), 431 (0.15); IR (KBr) νmax 3462, 2966, 2918, 1767, 1685, 1645, 1514, 756 cm�1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Tables 1 and 2; EIMS m/z (%) 432 [M]þ (4), 390 (16), 345 (25), 332 (100); HREIMS calcd for C23H25ClO6 [M]þ 432.1340, found 432.1344. 40-Epichaetoviridin A (8): orange, amorphous solid; [R]D 20 þ16 (c 0.002, CHCl3); UV (CHCl3) λmax nm (log ε) 306 (1.72), 367 (1.16), 430 (0.33); IR (KBr) νmax 3477, 2965, 1765, 1621, 1513 cm�1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Tables 1 and 2; EIMS m/z (%) 432 [M]þ (14), 390 (52), 345 (42), 332 (100); HREIMS calcd for C23H25ClO6 [M]þ 432.1340, found 432.1343. 40-Epichaetoviridin F (9): orange, amorphous solid; [R]D 20 þ106 (c 0.002, CHCl3); UV (CHCl3) λmax nm (log ε) 306 (0.97), 365 (0.68), 430 (0.18); IR (KBr) νmax 2967, 1768, 1621, 1512, 1219, 1167, 756, 458 cm�1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Tables 1 and 2; EIMS m/z (%) 416 [M]þ (26), 373 (34), 332 (100); HREIMS calcd for C23H25ClO5 [M]þ 416.1391, found 416.1378. 12β-Hydroxichaetoviridin C (10): yellow, amorphous solid; [R]D 20 �125 (c 0.002, CHCl3); UV (CHCl3) λmax nm (log ε) 293 (0.32), 389 (0.57), 409 (0.49), 434 (0.22);IR(KBr) νmax 3422, 2975, 1774, 1718, 1617, 1560, 1516, 1247, 1094 cm�1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Tables 1 and 2; EIMS m/z (%) 450 [M]þ (69), 432 (10), 406 (86), 388 (16), 362 (100); HREIMS calcd for C23H27ClO7 [M]þ 450.1445, found 450.1450.

X-ray Crystallographic Analysis of 1. Orange crystals of 1 were obtained from n-hexane/EtOAc by slow evaporation. X-ray diffraction data were measured on a Bruker Smart CCD diffractometer with graphite- monochromated Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å�) at 297(1) K. Data collection was based on three ω-scan runs (starting = �34�) at values of φ = 0�, 120�, and 240� with the detector at 2θ = �32�. For each of these runs, 606 frames were collected at 0.3� intervals and 10 s per frame. An additional run at φ = 0� of 100 frames was collected to improve redundancy. The diffraction frames were integrated using the program SAINT, and the integrated intensities were corrected for Lorentz�polarization effects with SADABS. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined to all 3778 unique Fo 2 by full matrix least-squares calculations using SHELXL- 97.21 All the hydrogen atoms were placed at idealized positions and refined as rigid atoms. Final R1 indices [2275 with I > 2σ(I)] 0.0670, wR2 = 0.1676. R indices (all data) R1 = 0.1168, wR2 = 0.1983. S[F2] 1.067 for 278 refined parameters. Crystallographic data of chaetoviridin A have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre under the reference number CCDC 758082.

Antibacterial Assays. Escherichia coli OP50 and Enterococcus faecalis MMH594 were grown on brain-heart infusion (BHI, Difco) media at 37 �C. C. elegans glp-4(bn2ts);sek-1(km4) mutant animals were maintained using standard practices by feeding them with E. coli strain OP50.22 Synchronized L4 stage to young adult worms were infected with E. faecalis according the protocol previously described.13 All compounds were tested according to the protocol described by Moy et al.13 at a final concentration of 100 and 50 μg mL�1 in 19% BHI, 80% M9 buffer, 80 μg mL�1 kanamycin, and 1% DMSO. Each compound was tested in triplicate using 96-well plates sealed with gas-permeable membranes (Breath-Easy, Diversified Biotech) at 25 �C, 80�85% relative humidity, without agitation for a total period of 168 h. Worm survival was scored at 3, 48, 120, and 168 h as described.13 A positive control was carried out using ampicillin at a range of 25�0.39 μg mL�1. ’ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information.
