Pupo*a  Received (in XXX, XXX) Xth XXXXXXXXX 20XX, Accepted Xth XXXXXXXXX 20XX  5  DOI: 10.1039/b000000x  The biosynthetic route for epoxyangelate esters of the sesquiterpene lactones (STL) uvedalin and  enhydrin from in vitro cultures of Smallanthus sonchifolius (Asteraceae) was investigated with 13C- precursors for the first time in the literature. Photomicroscope analyses and studies using MALDI-MS  imaging confirmed that glandular trichomes accumulate STL.   10  Smallanthus sonchifolius (Poepp & Endl.) H. Robinson  (Asteraceae) is popularly known as yacón and has attracted  worldwide attention because of its wide range of medicinal and  nutritional properties,1 despite its reported renal toxicity.2 The  melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones (STL) uvedalin (1) and  15  enhydrin (2) are the major constituents of the S. sonchifolius  leaves. Enhydrin (2) has been shown to exhibit anti- inflammatory,3 antimicrobial,4,5 and anti-diabetic activities.6  There is a significant amount of information on the structural  aspects of such STL7 and on their biological activities, but few  20  studies about STL biosynthesis. Only two feeding experiments  have been reported for the elucidation of the biosynthetic  pathways of STL in Asteraceae. In both studies, each plant  produced STL via different terpene pathways.8,9 Dimethylallyl  pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP)  25  are the universal precursors in the biosynthesis of terpenoids. The  biosynthesis of IPP can proceed via two different pathways in  plants: mevalonate (MVA) and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4- phosphate (MEP) pathways.10 Despite a significant amount of  recent research in this area, primarily on the establishment of the  30  MVA and MEP chemical reactions,11 knowledge pertaining to the  contribution of both pathways in the biosynthesis of different  plant terpenoids remains limited.     We report herein the complete elucidation of STL 1 and 2  biosynthetic pathway from Smallanthus sonchifolius using 1-13C- 35  D-glucose, 1,2-13C2-mevalonolactone, 2-13C-sodium acetate and  L-[U-13C6]-isoleucine as precursors. Nodal segments of S.  sonchifolius were sterilized and inoculated on solid and liquid  Murashige & Skoog media12 supplemented with the precursors  described above and allowed to grow aseptically until the  40  appropriate establishment of plantlets had formed.      First of all, segments of S. sonchifolius were sterilized and  inoculated on solid Murashige & Skoog medium12 supplemented  with 1-13C-D-glucose. An acetone extract from fresh shoots of S.  sonchifolius was prepared after eight weeks of culture and  45  fractioned via column chromatography and HPLC to yield 1 and  2. The patterns of incorporation of labeled substrates were  determined by quantitative 13C NMR by comparing the relative  intensities of the labeled and non-labeled STL signals for 1 and 2.  The 13C enrichment patterns of 1 and 2, after 1-13C-D-glucose  50  metabolism (Fig. 1), indicated that the three isoprene building  blocks were predominantly formed via the MEP pathway in the  STL framework. The 13C NMR spectrum of 13C-labeled 1  revealed enhancement of the signals at C-2 and C-14; C-8 and C- 13; and C-6 and C-15, thus indicating incorporation of label into  55  the corresponding C-1 and C-5 of IPP derived from the MEP  pathway as shown in Fig. 1. The 13C NMR spectrum of labeled 2  presented a similar enrichment pattern for the corresponding  carbon atoms from the sesquiterpene.     60            65            70    Fig. 1 Labeling patterns obtained by biosynthetic precursor 1-13C-D- glucose,  2-13C-sodium  acetate  and  L-[U-13C6]-isoleucine  into  sesquiterpene lactones 1 and 2.    Aliphatic esters of angelic, tiglic, isovaleric, and isobutyric acids  75  are believed to be products of the metabolism of the amino acids  L-isoleucine, L-leucine, and L-valine.13 In most biosynthetic  studies,  especially  concerning  Datura  meteloides  Dunal  (Solanaceae), L-[U-14C]-isoleucine is the precursor of tiglic  acid.14 The biosynthesis of acyl side chains from amino acids has  80  also been reported in plants from different families;15 however,  neither studies on Asteraceae species nor studies using 13C- labeled precursors to establish the acyl side chain origin have  been reported so far.     Two unsuccessful biosynthetic experiments performed by our  85  research group with plantlets of S. sonchifolius suggested that 1  and 2 are biosynthesized and accumulate during the early stages  of leaf development. To investigate the possibility of L-isoleucine  as a precursor of the epoxyangelate esters in 1 and 2, shoots of S.  sonchifolius were cultured in liquid MS medium supplemented  90  with L-[U-13C6]-isoleucine, 1,2-13C2-mevalonolactone, 2-13C- Page 1 of 3 ChemComm Chemical Communications Accepted Manuscript Published on 30 August 2013.

After nine weeks of culture,  an acetone extract from fresh shoots of S. sonchifolius was  prepared and fractioned as described above to yield 1 and 2. The  13C enrichment patterns of 1 and 2, after feeding with 1,2-13C2- mevalonolactone, showed that there was no incorporation of 1,2- 5  13C2-mevalonolactone in the biosynthesis of 1 and 2. This result  confirms the strong evidence that MEP is the single pathway  involved in sesquiterpene skeleton synthesis. Administering L- [U-13C6]-isoleucine thus resulted in multiplet signs at positions  1’, 2’, 3’, 4’ and 5’ of epoxyangelate moieties from 1 and 2,  10  therefore indicating operation of the amino acid on arrangement  of branched-chain ester. The remarkable multiplet signs observed  arise from couplings between 13C and 13C directly attached to  each other at the acyl side chain.      Synthesis of L-isoleucine from 1-13C-D-glucose resulted in  15  labeling pattern at positions 1’, 3’, 4’ and 5’ of epoxyangelate  moieties from 1 and 2. Isotopic labeling from 2-13C-sodium  acetate experiments led to enrichment at positions 1’, 3’ and 4’ of  epoxyangelate moieties from 1 and 2. Interestingly, the C-5’ did  not exhibit isotopic enrichment in the branched-chain ester of 1  20  and 2 from 2-13C-sodium acetate metabolism. Oxaloacetate (via  the tricarboxylic acid cycle), aspartate, threonine and glutamate  are key intermediates of L-isoleucine biosynthesis. Pyruvate  would be enriched from 1-13C-D-glucose metabolism, but not  enriched from 2-13C-sodium acetate pathway.16   25      These  results  obtained  from  13C-precursor  feeding  experiments explained why no isotopic enrichment at position C- 5’ was observed in the branched-chain ester after 2-13C-sodium  acetate was administered to S. sonchifolius. Furthermore, 2-13C- sodium acetate has not been incorporated into the sesquiterpene  30  scaffolds, providing additional evidence for exclusive MEP  pathway involvement. Moreover, the biosynthetic intermediates  involved in sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis were monitored by  LC-HRESIMS  in the crude extract of leaves from S.  sonchifolius. LC-HRESIMS analysis detected intermediates a  35  (m/z 433.1854 [M+H]+) and b (m/z 449.1804 [M+H]+),  suggesting that the epoxidation occurs in the final steps of  compound 2 biosynthesis.These results are in agreement with  literature data, because STL with branched-chain esters derived  from angelic and tiglic acids without epoxidation have been also  40  isolated from S. sonchifolius.17 These results suggest that  epoxidation might occur at the final steps of biosynthesis. Finally,  the complete biosynthesis involves first sesquiterpene skeleton  synthesis, followed by the acylation by the angelic acid moiety  (derived from L-isoleucine) at C-8 of STL scaffolds (derived  45  from MEP pathway) and further oxidations.  It has been reported that STL are produced and accumulated in  glandular  trichomes  from  leaves  and  are  important  chemotaxonomic markers of the Asteraceae in several species.18    A further expansion of the glandular trichomes was observed  50  microscopically; in vitro, the plant possesses the same glandular  trichomes as a cultivated plant. MALDI (Matrix-Assisted Laser  Desorption/Ionization) imaging procedures have the potential to  provide new insights of proteins and drugs within animal  tissues.19 MALDI imaging has been applied to analyze plant  55  tissues, but this remains an underexplored area.20 Generally, it has  been used on intact surfaces, such as leaves and petals;20  however, the laser can penetrate deeply and several layers of cells  can be analyzed. Intact (abaxial and adaxial surfaces) and  transversal sections of leaves from in vitro S. sonchifolius  were  60  analyzed by MALDI imaging to examine the tissue distributions  of STL, mainly compounds 1 and 2. The images from leaves of S.  sonchifolius, cultivated in vitro, were performed by MALDI in  positive mode acquiring MS and MS/MS data. On the intact  surfaces of leaves, the reconstructed images of adaxial and  65  abaxial sides for uvedalin and enhydrin (m/z 471 [M+Na]+ and  487 [M+Na]+, respectively) are shown in Fig. 2 (B, C), which  represent a part of leaf intact surface. Higher amounts of these  compounds were observed in the abaxial surface and its foliar  periphery. In the transversal section, the ions of 1 and 2 were  70  observed in glandular trichomes (Fig. 2E-F) by MS mode. The  analyses were carried out in the whole surfaces of transversal  sections, and some parts were expanded for visualization (Fig. 2- D). This trichome type was previously reported from leaves of S.  sonchifolius in adaxial and abaxial surfaces.21  75      Fig. 2 Optical images of intact leaf surface – adaxial side (A) and  transversal sections of leaves (D) of S. sonchifolius. MALDI-MS images  reconstructed with ions m/z 471 [M+Na]+ (1) and 487 [M+Na]+ (2) from  80  (abaxial (B) and adaxial (C) sides) and with  m/z 487 [M+Na]+ (E) and  471 [M+Na]+ (F) from transversal sections of leaves. MALDI-MS/MS  images (expansion) reconstructed with fragment ions m/z 371 of enhydrin  (G) and m/z 355 of uvedalin (H). (Ab: abaxial side, Ad: adaxial side, GT:  glandular trichome, Mi: mid rib)  85  Isolated 1 and 2 were analyzed by LIFT and the fragmentation  patterns from sodiated ions were studied. The main fragment ions  identifying these compounds were established because they were  important to yield reliable images from diagnostic fragment ions,  and then the proposed tissue distribution of 1 and 2 was  90  confirmed. Fig. 2G-H show the fragment ions of m/z 371 and 355  obtained from m/z 487 [M+Na]+ (1) and m/z 471 [M+Na]+ (2) in  transversal sections, respectively. They confirm the presence of  enhydrin and uvedalin in glandular trichomes using a more  reliable method, MS/MS mode. These images constructed with  95  the fragment ions demostrate the same distribution for enhydrin  and uvedalin. Although STL have been reported in glandular  trichomes,22 we confirmed the presence of such compounds in  glandular trichomes without doubts using MALDI Imaging  technique.  100  Conclusions  In conclusion, our studies on the biosynthesis of 1 and 2 have  shown that the sesquiterpene skeleton is derived from the MEP  pathway. We have also established the L-isoleucine origin of the  ester side chain in the sesquiterpene lactones.

In plants,  synthesis of terpenoids is thought to be compartmentalized in  such a way that mono- and diterpenes (also carotenoids and  chlorophylls) are produced via the MEP pathway in the plastids,  5  whereas sesquiterpenes and triterpenes are made in the cytosol  via the MVA pathway.23 However, others have reported  sesquiterpenoids biosynthesized by the MEP pathway.24 Our  results, together with previously reported data, seem to suggest  that plants do not synthesize sesquiterpenes exclusively in the  10  cytoplasm.25 It is possible that there are two cellular  compartments involved into STL biosynthesis: the formation of  the sesquiterpene (MEP pathway) and isoleucine (amino acid  metabolism) occurs in plastids, and the formation of intermediate  oxaloacetate by the TCA occurs in the mitochondria. This is the  15  first report of a biosynthetic study of STL from S. sonchifolius  and the experiments also allowed us to establish the biosynthetic  pathway for epoxyangelate esters with 13C-precursors for the first  time in the literature.
