The structures of 1-3 were established on the basis of interpretation of spectroscopic data, including HRESIMS, and 1D and 2D NMR techniques. All compounds were tested against a bacteria panel consisting of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, B. anthracis, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and M. phlei. Compound 2 showed moderate activity against these strains, with MIC values in the range 7-20 µg/mL. The genus Stemodia Benth. (Scrophulariaceae) is represented by 40 species distributed in Asia, Africa, Australia, and America.1 Iridoids and diterpenes are widely distributed in this genus, with the tetracyclic stemodane diterpenoids being an unusual structural type isolated from Stemodia maritima,2 a plant used medicinally in the Caribbean region to treat stomachache, edema, and swelling.3 Several Stemodia species are shrubs distributed in the tropical and subtropical areas of the world.4 In Brazil, Stemodia foliosa Benth., known as “meladinha”, is widespread, and in the north- eastern region, it is used popularly as a bioinsecticide and to treat respiratory infections.5 Our previous investigation on S. foliosa resulted in the isolation of stearic acid 4-[(n-pentoxy)phenyl] ester, which showed signiﬁcant activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis and the fast-acid bacterium Myco- bacterium fortuitum.6 In the course of a program aimed at identifying new bioactive compounds from Brazilian plant species, we have investigated the ethanolic extract from the aerial parts of S. foliosa. This has led to the isolation of three new labdane diterpenoids, 6R-acetoxymanoyl oxide (1), 6R-malonyloxymanoyl oxide (2), and 6R-malonyloxy-n-butyl ester manoyl oxide (3), together with several known compounds, betulinic acid, lupeol, stigmasterol, and sitosterol. We report herein the isolation and characterization of 1-3 and their antibacterial properties. The hexane phase obtained from liquid-liquid partition of a bioactive EtOH extract from the aerial parts of S. foliosa gave three new compounds (1-3) after sequential column chromatographic procedures on silica gel. Compound 1 was obtained as a colorless, amorphous solid, with [R]D30 +44.5. Electrospray-ionization MS showed a strong [M - H]+ ion peak at m/z 347 (100), and HRESIMS gave a [M]+ ion at m/z 348.5243, compatible with the molecular formula C22H36O3, which is consistent with a diterpene structure. IR absorptions at 1737 cm-1 indicated the presence of an ester carbonyl group. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) displayed signals corresponding to ﬁve tertiary methyls at δ 1.39 (CH3-17, s), 1.23 (CH3-16, s), 1.00 (CH3-20, s), 0.87(CH3-19, s), and 0.86 (CH3-18, s), three oleﬁnic hydrogens at δ 5.86 (1H-14, dd, J ) 17.0, 11.0 Hz), 4.83 (1H-15, dd, J ) 11.0, 1.5 Hz), and 5.03 (1H-15, dd, J ) 17.0, 1.5 Hz), one oxymethine hydrogen at δ 5.08 (H-6, ddd, J ) 11.5, 11.9, 4.5 Hz), and one acetyl methyl group at δ 2.00 (s). From the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) a labdane diterpene structure type was proposed for 1.7,8 The signals corresponding to oleﬁnic carbons (δ 147.5 and 110.4) of a monosubstituted vinyl group were analyzed together with three oxygen-substituted carbons (δ 70.8, 74.0, 73.5) and one acetoxyl group (δ 170.0, 21.9) and suggested that 1 is a manoyl oxide derivative.9 Also, on the basis of 13C NMR data, the relative stereochemistry of C-16 was deduced, since the value attributed to this carbon is quite different for the manoyl oxide series (C-16, δ ca. 28.5) from that in the epi-manoyl oxide series (C-16, δ ca. 33.0).10,11 This is consistent with the NOESY spectral data (Figure 1). Thus, taking into account these considerations, compound 1 was determined to be a manoyl oxide. The acetoxyl function at C-6 was also established on the basis of 1H and 13C NMR data. The chemical shift of H-6 in conjunction with the coupling constants observed for the signal corresponding to this hydrogen (Table 1) was diagnostic for the attachment of the acetoxyl group in an R-position.12 Additionally, NOESY data permitted the determination of the relative conﬁguration of C-6, C-16, and C-17 (Figure 1), thereby conﬁrming 1 to be a new compound. Total assignments of 1H and 13C NMR signals were also conﬁrmed by the COSY, TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC spectra (Table S1, Supporting Information). Accordingly, diterpene 1 was characterized as 6R- acetoxymanoyl oxide. Compound 2 was isolated as an optically active white solid ([R]D30 +46.9) and exhibited spectroscopic data quite similar to those of compound 1. HRESIMS afforded the molecular formula C23H36O5 and a molecular ion at m/z 392.5341, 44.0098 amu higher * To whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel: 55 16-33016660. Fax: 55 16-33327932.

Accurate analysis of spectroscopic data including the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) demonstrated that compounds 1 and 2 are closely related, indicating the same diterpene skeleton for 2. The only difference observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of 2 was the singlet signal at δ 3.31, instead of the signal for the acetyl group observed for compound 1. The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra revealed the presence of three additional carbons for 2 at δ 173.9 (s), 171.1 (s), and 43.6 (t). These observations together with 1H-1H COSY and HMBC data (Table S2, Supporting Information) indicated that diterpene 2 has a malonyloxy moiety at C-6. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by the HMBC spectrum, due to a 3J cross- peak between H-6 (δ 5.08) and C-1′ (δ 173.9) and a 2J cross-peak between H-2′ (δ 3.31) and C-1′(δ 173.9) and C-3′ (δ 171.1). In addition, like diterpene 1, the coupling constants between H-6 and H-5/H-7 (J ) 10.5, 11.0, 4.8 Hz) indicated the same relative conﬁguration for the substituent at C-6. The relative conﬁguration of the chiral centers C-8 and C-13 in 2 were assigned by NOE correlations between CH3-16 and CH3-17 (Figure 1), in agreement with a manoyl oxide diterpene skeleton.7,8 On the basis of the above evidence, compound 2 was characterized as 6R-malonyloxymanoyl oxide. Compound 3 was obtained as a white, amorphous solid with [R]D30 +57.0 and exhibited a molecular ion peak at [M+] m/z 448.6454 in the HRESIMS, corresponding to C27H44O5. The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 was very similar to that of 2 (Table 1), suggesting that this compound also belongs to the manoyl oxide diterpene series. The main chemical shift differences observed in the 1H NMR spectrum were due to the additional signals at δ 3.84 Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR Data for Compounds 1-3a 1 2 3 position δC δH δC δH δC δH 1 38.7 CH2 1.57, m 38.7 CH3 1.66, br d (12) 38.7 CH3 1.66, br d (12) 1.45, m 0.92, br t (12) 0.92, br t (12) 2 18.1 CH2 1.67, m 18.0 CH3 2.08, m 18.3 CH3 2.08, m 1.49, dt (16, 6) 1.43, m 1.43, m 3 43.3 CH2 1.16, dt 43.3 CH3 2.60, br d 43.7 CH3 2.6, br d (16) (12.5) (12.5) 1.37, dt (16) 1.03, m 1.03, m 4 33.6 C 33.2 C 33.0 C 5 58.8 CH 1.32, d (11.0) 58.6 CH 1.32, d (11) 58.6 CH 1.32, d (11) 6 70.8 CH 5.08, ddd 72.4 CH 5.08, ddd 72.4 CH 5.08, ddd (11.5, 11, 4.5) (10.5, 11, 4.8) (10, 11, 4.8) 7 49.8 CH2 2.11, dd 49.2 CH 2.20, dd 49.5 CH 2.20, dd (11.5, 12.0) (10.5, 10.8) (10, 10.8) 1.87, dd 1.46, dd 1.46, dd (4.5, 12.0) (4.8, 10.8) (4.8, 10.8) 8 74.0 C 74.3 C 73.9 C 9 54.1 CH 1.78, m 54.0 CH 1.44, br d 54.7 CH 1.44, br d (12.5) (12.5) 10 37.8 C 37.9 C 37.8 C 11 15.4 CH2 1.55, m 15.4 CH2 1.58, m 15.6 CH2 1.58, m 1.42, m 1.39, m 1.39, m 12 34.6 CH2 1.52, m 34.6 CH2 1.50, m 34.6 CH2 1.50, m 2.07, m 2.07, m 13 73.5 C 73,5 C 73.4 C 14 147.5 CH 5.86, dd 147.5 CH2 5.86, dd 147.4 CH2 5.86, dd (17.5, 11.0) (17.4, 10.7,) (10.7, 17.4) 15 110.4 CH2 4.83, dd 110.9 CH2 4.92, dd 110.3 CH2 5.14, dd (11.0, 1.50) (10.7, 1.6) (17.4, 1.6) 5.03, dd 5.14, dd 4.92, dd (17.0, 150) (17.4, 1.6) (10.7, 1.6) 16 29.1 CH3 1.23, s 29.3 CH3 1.21, s 29.4 CH3 1.21, s 17 26.9 CH3 1.39, s 25.9 CH3 1.37, s 27.0 CH3 1.37, s 18 36.0 CH3 0.86, s 36.2 CH3 0.84, s 36.1 CH3 0.84, s 19 21.8 CH3 0.87, s 22.7 CH3 0.86, s 22.1 CH3 0.86, s 20 16.4 CH3 1.00. s 16.5 CH3 0.99, s 16.6 CH3 0.99, s -OAc 170.0 C 21.9 CH3 2.00, s 1′ 173.9 C 166.9 C 2′ 43.6 CH2 3.31, s 42.5 CH2 3.20, s 3′ 171.1 C 165.6 C 1′′ 65.6 CH2 3.84, m 2′′ 36.1 CH2 1.47, m 3′′ 19.9 CH2 1.37, m 4′′ 13.8 CH3 0.93, t (7.0) a 500 MHz for 1H NMR and 125 MHz for 13C NMR; CDCl3.

These data analyzed together with the signals at δ 65.6 (t), 36.1 (t), 19.9 (t), and 13.8 (q), observed in the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1), suggested the presence of a side-chain n-butyl in the structure of 3. This structural feature was further corroborated by 1H-1H COSY analysis, which indicated one spin system (C-1′′-C-2′′-C-3′′-C- 4′′), in agreement with a n-alkyl unity. The HMBC correlations of H-6 (5.08) to C-1′ (166.9), Η-1′′ (3.84) to C-3′ (165.6), and H-4′′ to C-2′′ revealed that the n-butyl unit is connected to the ester unit at C-6. This assumption was supported from the analysis of all spectroscopic data, including the NOESY, TOCSY, and HMBC spectra (Table S3, Supporting Information), which were consistent with the proposed structure, 6R-malonyloxy-n-butyl ester manoyl oxide (3). Diterpenoids 1-3 were examined for their antibiotic activity toward the bacteria S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, B. anthracis, M. luteus, M. smegmatis, and M. phlei (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, diterpene 2 exhibited moderate antibiotic activity, and 1 and 3 were inactive. It was also interesting to note that the malonyloxy function at C-6 seems to be an important feature for the antibacterial activity. Additionally, the antibacterial activity of 2 serves to corroborate the popular uses attributed for this plant to treat infectious respiratory diseases. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer polarimeter model 341 using a sodium lamp (589 nm) at 20 °C. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1725X FT spectrometer with KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unit 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125.67 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard; gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, NOESY, and DEPT NMR experiments were performed in the same spectrometer, using standard Varian pulse sequences. High- resolution mass spectra were measured on a Q-TOF Bruker spectrom- eter, using ESI+ mode. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 230-400 mesh (Merck), XAD-2 (Sigma-Aldrich), or Sepha- dex LH-20 (Pharmacia). TLC was carried out using silica gel 60 (>230 mesh, Merck) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC were visualized under UV light and/or by spraying with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent followed by heating. Preparative HPLC was performed on a preparative LC 4000 system (Waters) using C18 (250 mm × 21.20 mm, Phenomenex) columns. Plant Material. The aerial parts of Stemodia foliosa were collected in July 2000 in Va´rzea-PE, Brazil, and identiﬁed by Dr. Alda de Andrade Chiapeta. A voucher specimen has been deposited in the herbarium of the Department of Botany, UFPE (UFP/19810). Extraction and Isolation. The powdered, sun-dried aerial parts (1.0 kg) of S. foliosa were extracted with EtOH (5 × 1 L). The EtOH extract was ﬁltered and evaporated in vacuo to obtain a dark green, gummy residue. Then, the EtOH extract was partitioned with n-BuOH-H2O (1:1, 3 × 1L). The n-BuOH extract (41.76 g) was partitioned with MeOH-H2O/hexane. The hexane extract (9.47 g) was fractionated by silica gel column chromatography and eluted with hexane-EtOAc into ﬁve fractions, F-1 (6% hexane), F-2 (2.8%), F-3 (9.08%), F-4 (2.44%), and F-5 (28.68%) with hexane-AcOEt (9:1). Compounds 1 (50 mg) and 2 (80 mg) were obtained by column chromatography of fraction F-2 on silica gel, eluting with hexane-EtOAc (9:1). Compound 3 (40 mg) was obtained by column chromatography of fraction F-5 on silica gel, eluting with hexane-EtOAc (1:1). 6r-Acetoxymanoyl oxide (1): white, amorphous crystals; Rf 0.4 (hexane-EtOAc, 9:1); [R]D30 +44.5 (c 1.50, CHCl3); IR (KBr) νmax 3452, 2933, 1737 1461 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 1; ESMS m/z 348 [M+] (18), 347 (100), 305 (30), 255 (15), 138 (5), 85 (10); HRESIMS (m/z) 348.5243 [M]+ (calcd for C22H36O3, 348.5205). 6r-Malonoyloxymanoyl oxide (2): white, amorphous crystals; Rf 0.28 (hexane-EtOAc, 9:1); [R]D30 +46.95 (c 1.51, CHCl3); IR (KBr) νmax 3466, 2934, 1735, 1460 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data, see Table 2; EIMS m/z 448.3 [M+] (45), 274 (21.2), 273.4 (100), 190 (35.8), 95 (11.4), 81 (17.8); HRESIMS (m/z) 392.5341 (calcd for C23H36O5, 392.5404). 6r-Malonyloxy-n-butyl ester manoyl oxide (3): white, amorphous solid; Rf 0.28 (hexane-EtOAc, 1:1); [R]D30 +57.0 (c 1.51, CHCl3); IR (KBr) νmax 3432, 3086, 2927, 1731, 1714, 1578; 1H and 13C NMR, see Table 1; ESMS m/z 392 [M+] (4.1), 347 (100), 305 (14); HRESIMS (m/z) 348.6454 (calcd for 348.6483).
