Abstract-Two  new alkaloids,  8-methoxycanthin-6-one  and 3-methoxycanthin-2,6-dione,  were  isolated  from  the EtOH  extract  of the bark of Simaba  cuspidata  Spruce  ex Engl. Elucidation  of the structure  of the latter  compound  included  ‘%  NMR  spectral  comparison  with  2-methoxypyridine-N-oxide  and  N-methoxy-2-  pyridone.  INTRODUCTION  Simaba  cuspidata  Spruce  ex Engl.,  var. typica Cron-  quist, an arborescent  shrub or small tree, is common  in  the Rio Negro forest of Amazonas,  Brazil [l]. Its bark  gave an EtOH  extract  from which a yellow and a red  alkaloid,  characterized  respectively  as  8-methoxy-  canthin-6-one  (la)  and  3-methoxycanthin-2,6-dione  (k),  were isolated.  RESULTS  The  yellow  alkaloid  (CISHIOOZNZ, mp 175-176”)  shows  in the  IR spectrum  a band  at 1670cm-’  in  agreement  with  the presence  of a lactam.  The  MS  exhibits  a M’ (m/e 250) compatible  with a methoxy-  canthinone  and a fragmentation  pattern  similar to that  of other  canthinones  [2-4].  The UV spectrum  is also  compatible  with a canthinone  structure  [2-S]: addition  of acid, but not of base, causes a bathochromic  shift of  the  maxima.  The  reduction  product  of the  yellow  alkaloid  with  Zn/HCI  has a UV  reminiscent  of /3-  carboline  derivatives  [6]. The  ‘H NMR  spectrum  at 100 MHz permits  a detailed  analysis  indicating  the  absence  of substitution  on rings  C and  D and  the  presence  of a methoxy  group. This must be located  at  C-8, since  the signal  at 88.13,  attributed  to H-7 by  virtue of its low field location,  shows no ortho-coupling  (Table  1). Structure  la is therefore  proposed.  R2Jc-xyqR’  la R’=H,Rz=OMe  lb R’=R2=H  lc R’=OMe,R2=H  * Part I in the proposed  series ‘The Chemistry  of Brazilian  Simaroubaceae’.  The red alkaloid  (mp> 320”, strong  green  fluores-  cence in solution)  shows in the IR spectrum  an intense  band at 1640 cm -‘, indicating  again at least one lac-  tam  carbonyl  group.  There  is no evidence  of OH  groups.  The  high-resolution  MS  and  elemental  analysis  signify  a molecular  formula  of C,,H,,O,N,  with one more oxygen  atom than la. Otherwise,  the  MS is similar to that of la, except for the facile loss of  31 amu, probably  a OMe group,  from the M’.  The  UV  spectrum  is again  in agreement  with  a  canthinone  structure.  This time,  however,  the spec-  trum  is not altered  by the addition  of either  acid or  base, indicating  the absence  of a phenolic  function  and  the lack of basicity of both nitrogen  atoms.  Again,  the  UV spectrum  of the Zn/HCI  reduction  product  indi-  cates a /3 -carboline.  313  The ‘H NMR spectrum  at 270 MHz, including  the  irradiation  of each signal in turn,  unambiguously  es-  tablishes  a sequence  of 4 protons  in ring A and of 2  protons  in ring D (Table  1). Both the OMe grr- z and  the additional  oxygen  must  therefore  be Ir.calzd  at  ring C. This ring must also contain  the only remaining  proton,  represented  by a singlet  at 87.27.  This rela-  tively high field position  excludes  one possible  struc-  ture, 1-methoxycanthin-6-one-3-oxide  (5a), since in the  unsubstituted  N-oxide,  i.e. in canthin-6-one-3-oxide  (Sb), H-l  and H-2 appear  at 67.78 and 8.32, respec-  tively [4].  Thus only two structures  need to be considered:  2-  methoxycanthin-6-one-3-oxide  (5~) and  3-methoxy-  canthin-2,6-dione  (2a).

The methine  carbon  signals could be in part assigned  by correlating  residual  couplings  in  the  single-frequency  off-  resonance  decoupled  (sford) spectrum  with the known  ‘H chemical  shifts  and by chemical  shift considera-  tions.  A striking  feature  in the spectrum  is the low  field absorption  of the OMe carbon  (S64.8),  as com-  pared with other MeO-aryl  functions,  e.g. 2-methoxy-  pyridine  (853.1)  [7]. Since  both  N-oxide  formation  and the substitution  of the OMe  group  on nitrogen  could conceivably  cause deshielding  of the carbon  in  question,  2-methoxypyridine-N-oxide  (3) and its ther-  mal  rearrangement  product,  N-methoxy-2-pyridone  (4) [8-lo]  were  run as models  (Table  2).

Isolation  of constituents. A specimen of S. cuspidata from  the vicinity  of Manaus,  was identified  by Dr. W. A. Rod-  rigues,  INPA,  Manaus,  Amazonas.  Air-dried,  powdered  trunk  bark (1 kg) was extracted  with EtOH.  The solvent  was  evapd  over Si gel and the residue  extracted  successively  with  petrol,  CHCl,  and  MeOH.  The  CHCI,-residue  (log)  was  chromatographed  on acid-washed  A&O,  (3OOg,  activity  I).  Elution  with C,H,-CHCI,  6:4  and  1: 1 afforded  fractions  which  after  repeated  crystallixations  from  the indicated  sol-  vents  gave  respectively  la  (40mg,  EtOH)  and 2a (80 mg,  HOAc).  8-Mefhoxycanthin-6-one  (la),  yellow,  mp 175-176  (EtOH)  (Found:  C, 72.26;  H, 4.31;  N, 10.60.
