The fruits of G. schwackeanum contain the gnetins  C and E.  Of the 33 recognized Gnetum species, only 6 occur in tropical America, G.  leyboldii Tull. being distributed towards the south of Amazonia mainly in marshy  or periodically flooded regions and G. schwackeanum Taub. occurring throughout  the State of Amazonas on “terra firme” (non-flooded ground) (2). An ethanol  extract of the woody part of the former liana contained five novel compounds  designated gnetins A to E. An acetone extract of the fruits of the latter liana  contained the gnetins C and E.  RESULTS  The constitution and relative configuration la for gnetin-A was deduced as  follows. The compound, C2sH2206, gave a tetrahydroderivative, C28H2606 (lb) ,  and a tetraacetate, CzsHlsOa (OAC)~  (IC). The two undefined oxygens are part  of an a,b-unconjugated ketone (vmax 1670 cm-l) and of a cyclopentanone (vmax  1760 cm-l).  Comparison of the ‘H nmr spectra of gnetin-A and of its tetraacetate  revealed the location of the four hydroxyls on two 4-hydroxyphenyl and one 3,5-  dihydroxyphenyl groups (table 1). Hydrogenation of gnetin-A produced only  one significant nmr spectral modification related to aromatic protons,  The  AA’-signal representing H-2 and H-6 of one of the Phydroxyphenyl groups  shifted from 6 7.56 to 6 7.24; the group was, thus, part of a styryl system. The  intense uv absorption of gnetin-A suggested the conjugation of the styryl portion  to be extended by the a,b-unsaturated ketone moiety. Indeed, the observed  data (Xmax 367 nm, ~=25900) are compatible with the expected data (Xmax ca.  377 nm, e = ca. 45000) (3) for such a 6-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-alj3,T,6-unsaturated  ketone system. Neither the trans CH=CH group, evidenced by two doublets  (6 7.15 and 7.28, J=16Hz), nor H-a, evidenced by a broad singlet (6 6.26), of  this system showed further vicinal couplings. For this reason substitution must  occur at the 8-carbon and at the carbonyl, as shown in la.  ‘Part I of the proposed series “The chemistry of Brazilian Gnetaceae. For a preliminary  report on gnetin-A see Ref. (1).  754  Kov-Dec 19821  Lins et al.: Gnetins  YYYY??  m m r o r o N N   Y Y   2 2  **  I &%  aaaa  a a a  aaa  756  Journal of Natural Products  [Vol. 45, No. 6  la R = H   lb R=H, 7,8,9,lGtetrahydro  IC R=Ac  HO J&b  '  OH  2a R = H   2b R=OH  The foregoing deductions accounted for 17 sp*-carbon signals of the 13C nmr  spectrum representing 23 carbons, and only one spz-carbon signal and four sp3-  carbon signals remained to be assigned. These five signals indicated the cyclo-  pentanone moiety to include, besides the carbonyl (6 203.6, singlet), four methines  (6 72.8, 56.4, 54.2 and 51.7, all doublets).  The four moieties (two aryls, one &aryl-a,b,y,&unsaturated ketone and one  cyclopentanone) fit into a structure, formally derived by dehydrodimerization  of resveratrol @a), such as la. Indeed, la would explain the relatively large  chemical shift of one of the methine carbons (6 72.8) in view of the location of  C-12 on a bridgehead between two carbonyls (4), as well as the W-couplings  between H-14 and H-10 (J=l.OHz), H-10 and H-12 (J=l.OHz) and H-12 and  OH  3  H-14 (J=1.5Hz) in view of the location of the three protons at alternate positions  of a hexacycle. The assignments of the H-14 (6 3.87) and H-12 (6 3.68) resonances  were based on the recognition of the allylic nature of H-14.  In contrast to the  signal of H-12, the H-14 signal was strongly shifted upfield (to 6 2.70) upon  hydrogenation.  In another contrasting feature, H-14 showed no additional  coupling, a fact which established the H14C.CH8' dihedral angle at about 90".  Vicinal couplings, however, occurred between H-12 and H-7', (6 3.77, triplet,  J=7.OHz), as well as between H-7' and H-S' (6 3.43, doublet, J=7.OHz). In  consequence, the bicyclo (3.2.1) octane skeleton of gnetin-A must be substituted  Nov-Dec 19821  Lins et d.: Gnetins  757  by 7'-endo and 8'-exo-aryls. Double irradiation at the frequency of H-7' not  only collapsed the H-12 double doublet into a broad singlet and the H-8' doublet  into a singlet but also produced a 10% intensity enhancement of the H-2', H-6'  signal of the unconjugated 4hydroxyphenyl. This must, hence, occupy position  7'. The ortho proton signals of both of the other aryls were unaffected, and the  3,5-dihydroxyphenyl group can only occupy position 8'. All other possible  double irradiation experiments were performed, and the observed band simplifica-  tions and Overhauser-effects were fully consistent with the proposed structure la.  Comparison of 'H nmr data with la (gnetin-A) (table 1) suggested constitution  3 for gnetin-B, C28H9406. Indeed, a Phydroxyphenyl and a 3,bdihydroxy-  phenyl group, both linked to sp3-carbons, were again represented by comparable  signals (table 1). The H-7, 8 and 10 signals of the 4-OH-CeH4.CH=CH.C=  CH moiety all appeared at somewhat higher field, indicating the absence of a  conjugated carbonyl in 3. Accordingly, the a,@-unsaturated ketone band was  absent from the ir spectrum of 3, as was the cyclopentanone band, here replaced  by a cyclohexanone band (1740 cm-l).  Accomodation of these structural units,  as shown in the bicyclo (2.2.2) octanoid formula 3, is not only consistent with all  the spectral evidence but also conforms again to a biosynthetic process involving  the dimerization of resveratrol (2a).  Gnetin-C (4a) possesses the molecular formula CzsH2206 and is thus, isomeric  OH  4a R = H   4b R=OH  with gnetin-A (la). Analysis of its 'H nmr spectrum (table 1) showed, again,  substitution of a C8Hs02 core by 4hydroxystyry1, 4-hydroxyphenyl and 3,5-  dihydroxyphenyl units. Here, however, the central group was formed by a  dihydrobenzofuran unit precisely as in eviniferin (5), a phytoalexin from Vitis  vinijerera (5). Although these units have two meta-related protons on resorcinol-  OH  OH  3'  5  6  758  Journal of Natural Products  [Vol. 45, No. 6  type aromatic rings in both, 4a and 5, the environment of the protons is different.  While in 4a H-10 (6 6.60, d, J = l H z )  and H-14 (6 6.70, d, J=IHz) are both  vicinal to the styryl substituent, in 5 not H-12 (6 6.35, d, J=2.1 Hz) but only  H-14 (6 6.75, d, J=2.1Hz) is vicinal to the deshielding group. Still another  isomer of gnetin-C, the dehydrodimer 6 obtained by treatment of resveratrol  (2a) with horseradish-hydrogen peroxide ( G ) ,  serves as a good model, although  the two aromatic rings linked to the vinyl group are interchanged.  Here, as in  4a, H-10 and H-14 (6 6.55, d, J=2Hz) are ortho-related to the styryl substituent  and are again considerably less shielded than the para-related H-12 (6 6.28).  The location of the styryl group in 4a was confirmed by double irradiation of  H-8 (6 6.97), which not only produced an Overhauser-effect on H-2 and H-6  (at 6 7.45) but also improved the resolution of both broad doublets corresponding  to H-10 and H-14 (at 6 6.60 and 6.70). The relative location of the two aryls  on the hydrobenzofuran system was established by the observation of enhancement  of intensity of the H-2', H-6' signal (at 6 7.22) upon double irradiation of H-7  and oice cersa (due to nuclear Overhauser-eff ect and/or elimination of benzylic  coupling).  All differences in the 'H nmr spectra of gnetin-C (4a, C28H2206) and gnetin-D  (4b, C~~H2207)  are accounted for by the additional presence of a hydroxyl at C-2'  of the latter compound. Indeed, upon comparison of the spectra of 4a and 4b  (table l), significant shifts were observed only for the resonances due to H-3',  H-5', H-6' and H-7' (A6 resp. -0.38,  -0.55,  -0.20,  +0.35). The strong  deshielding of H-7' must be attributed to the existence of a hydrogen-bridge  between the OH at C-2' and the heterocyclic oxygen, thus confirming the location  of the 2,4dihydroxyphenyl group at C-7'.  Again, as in 4a, in 4b the Phydroxy-  styryl is vicinal to two unsubstituted aryl positions, since double irradiation of  H-8 (at 6 6.97) affected both originally broad doublets due to H-10 and H-14  (at 6 6.57 and 6.73). In gnetin-D (4b) two different stilbenes, resveratrol (2a)  and oxyresveratrol (2b) are oxidatively associated.  Although the 270 JIHz 'H nmr spectrum of gnetin-E is quite complex, its  peaks are easily assigned to the protons of 7a upon the assumption that the differ-  ences of the resonances of gnetin-C and the outermost stilbene portions of gnetin-E  are smaller (A6 0.00*0.01) than the differences of the resonances of gnetin-C  and the innermost stilbene portion of gnetin-E (A6 0.08*0.09).  All possible  double irradiation experiments were performed and, together with the spectral  shifts observed upon acetylation to the heptaacetate (7b), confirmed the structure  as the trans, trans-form of (?a), an oxidative trimer of resveratrol (2a).  We have postulated, so far, a trans relationship between the two aryl groups  that substitute the dihydrofuran ring. This is the most common configuration  3  7a R = H   7b R=Ac  Nov-Dec 19821  Lins et al.: Gnetins  759  for this type of products in nature (6), but it cannot be easily substantiated by  'H nmr vicinal coupling constants (7) since conformational factors influence  quite strongly the dihedral angles involving C-7', C-8' and C-7n, C-P.  A priori  it could be postulated that this angle should be substantially identical in all  dihydrobenzofurans mentioned in the paper (4a, 4b, 5, 6, 7a, 7b). That this  is not the case is clearly due to differential substitution at the ortho-positions of  aromatic rings. The presence of a hydroxyl at this position is especially efficient  in depressing the J H-7', H-8' value:  This is, in Hz, 8.0 in 6 (with H-2) and  8.5/7.5 in 7b (with resp. OAc-15'/OAc-15) against only 5.5/4.5 in 7a (with resp.  OH-15'/OH-15) and 4.5 in 4a (with OH-15), and even as low as 3.5 in 4b (with  OH-15 and OH-2').  A para hydroxystyryl group at C-15 (5) also diminishes  J H-7', H-8' (to 5.4 Hz), albeit somewhat less strongly than a hydroxyl.  A posteriori such facts can be used diagnostically, e.g., in the distinction of gnetin  C (4a) from t-viniferin (5) and in the assignment of 'H resonances to the outer-  most versus the inner dihydrobenzofuran portions of oxidative resveratrol trimers,  tetramers etc. of type 7a.  DISCUSSION  Resveratrol (Za) occurs in gymnosperms (Pinaceae) as well as in angiosperms  (Leguminosae [Fabaceae], Myrtaceae, Vitaceae, Moraceae and Liliaceae), being  accompanied in the latter two families by oxyresveratrol (a).  The bicyclo-  octanoid dimers gnetins-A (la) and B (3) belong to novel natural product types.  Dihydrobenzofuranoid oligomers, albeit of different structures than gnetins-C  (4a), D (4b) and E (7), are constituents of Dipterocarpaceae and phytoalexins  of Vitaceae (8).  8  The most notable feature of the present findings is the structural analogy of  gnetins with the oxidative dimers of propenylphenols and allyphenols, e.g. 8, 9  and 10 (9). Such bicyclo (3.2.1) octanoid and hydrobenzofuranoid neolignans  are chemically interconvertible, e.g., 8+9 (10). An analogous rearrangement  may conceivably also operate in the gnetin series.  9  10  760  Journal of Natural Products  [Vol. 45, No. 6  EXPERIMENTAL  ISOLATION  OF THE CONSTITUENTS  OF Gnetum leyboUii.-The  liana was collected at the shores  of the Guama River, Para State. A Sam le of dry, powdered bark (450 g) was extracted  successively with light petroleum ether, etfyl acetate and ethanol. The ethanol was evapo-  rated. To the residue (15 g) in methanol (30 ml) chloroform was added. The precipitate was  filtered and mixed with Si gel. The powder was introduced on top of a Si gel (600 g) column.  Elution with chloroform gave aliphatic material (2.5 g). Elution with chloroform-ethyl  acetate (7:3) gave a solid (7 g) which was fractionated by preparative tlc [Si gel, chloroform-  methanol (9:1)] into a less polar part A and a more polar one B. Part A was separated by  repeated tlc [Si gel, chloroform-methanol (9:1)] into 4a (40mg), la (lg), and 3 (30mg).
