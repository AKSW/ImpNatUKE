P.  s p  192 and P. s p  212 contains terpenes, sesquiterpenes and  ketones. Pome of them are reported for the first time in the genus.  The leaves of jaborandi are commercially exploited in the Brazilian Sortheast  for induftrial extraction of pilocarpine, an alkaloid ri-ith potent cholinergic ac-  tivity (1).  In the leaves, there is also an essential oil present x-hose composition is reg-  istered in the literature in a confusing and incomplete way (2, 3, 4) n-hich might  be attributed to improper selection of plant material or lack of suitable identihca-  tion because analyses were made on commercial materials. Therefore, chemical  reexamination of the essential oil from five distinct Pilocarpus species n-as con-  ducted together with an analysis of the leaves used by local industry.  DISCUSSIOS  The plants were collected in the states of CearA, ;\laranh8o, and Pernanibuco.  Commercial material was obtained from the industry in the state of Piaui. The  lact material was mainly composed of Pilocarpus microphyllus Stapf. leaflets ac-  cording to pliarniacognostic examination (3). P. jaboraiidi Holmes, P. micro-  pltyllirs and P. afiiiis pauci-flortis Stapf. were identified among the specie; col-  lected: t n o  other distinct species of the genus are in the stage of botanical identi-  fication. Essential oil from each sample was obtained by steam distillation.  I'ields and collection sites are described in table 1.  TABLE  1.

G  Table 2 presents the chemical composition of the essential oil from the five  Pilocarpus species and includes. also, analyis of a commercial sample. a-Pinene  is the only constituent present in all species studied, and the rare diterpene  sandaracopimaradiene is characteristic of Pilocarpus jaborandi.  The chemical constituents of the essential oil from commercial pilocarpus  leaves confirms the pharmacognostic identification of P. mycrophyllus as the  major species present in the mixture. The presence of all compounds except  limonene and 2-undecanone is being reported for the first time in the genus.  T.ABLE 2.

ISOLATIOS  OF COSSTITrJEh.TS.-ESSential  oil extraction TTas carried out by steam distillation  of finely ground leaves in an apparatus developed in our laboratory (5). The yields (volume/  volume) are reported in table 1. Each essential oil, after separation, was dried with anhydrous  sodium sulfate, filtered, and sealed in glass vials under nitrogen atmosphere.  SOV-DEC 19i9] CRAVEIRO ET AL. : ESSESTIAL OILS FROII PILOCARPCS  67 1  The fresh oils aere analyzed by glc on a YARI.IS FID instrument equipped nith a stain-  less steel column (1.5 ni x 3.0 mm) packed with 5% 07--101 on chromosorh W,  at the programmed  temperature 5W250"C 4' 'min, and with nitrogen as carrier gas.  Limonene, niyrcene, a-pinene, sabinene, cargophyllene, humulene, yelemene, and sandara-  copimaradiene nere isolated by preparative glc performed in a VARI-IS FID instrument  with an aluminum column (6 5 m x 9 nim) packed with 3% OT--101 on chromosorb R.  The oils n-ere submitted to gc ms separation on a FISSIGAY 3300 quadrupole mass  spectrometer coupled to a gc equipped with a glass column (1,s m x 3,l mm) packed S-ith 3%  05--101 on chromosorb W with helium as the carrier gas and ms spectra recorded at 70 eT-.  The infrared spectra were obtained on a Zeiss UR-20 instrument using liquid films.  The pmr spectra were obtained on a T--4RIAiX 60 MHz instrument in carbon tetrachloride  solution with TMS as internal standard.
