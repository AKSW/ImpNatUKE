Introduction Fungal endophytes comprise a wide range of fungi character- ized by the ability to live for a certain period of their life-cycles internally and asymptomatically in plants (Wang et al., 2007). Such co-existence may confer adaptative advantages to the plant host, such as feeding deterrence, protection against insects and microbial pathogens (De Souza et al., 2004). Considering that chemical clues are usually involved in these biological interactions, natural products from endophytic fungi very often present a broad spectrum of biological activities (Zhang et al., 2006). Isocoumarins are metabolites of limited distribution, which occur in bacteria, fungi and lichen (Kutschera et al., 2003). These compounds have also been detected in secretions of termites and ants (Engelmeier et al., 2004). Several biological activities have been reported for this class, including cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antiallergic, algicidal, gastroprotective, protease inhibitory, anti- fungal (O¨ zcan et al., 2007; Krohn et al., 1997; Guimara˜es et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2009) as well as plant growth regulators (Kuramata et al., 2007). The Brazilian cerrado trees are well known sources of bioactive secondary metabolites (Bolzani et al., 1991; Young et al., 1992; Silva et al., 2007, 2010). Among these, A. macrophylla K. Schum (Rubiaceae) and P. aduncum L. (Piperaceae) were chosen for a detailed microbiological investigation. These plants presented several endophytes, including Penicillium and Xylaria species, which were submitted to chemical and biological investigations. Herein, we report the isolation and biological activities of one new dihydroisocoumarin, (3R,4R)-3,4-dihydro-4,6-dihydroxy-3- methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid (1) and two known dihydroisocoumarins, (R)-7-hydroxymellein (2) and (3R,4R)-4,7-dihydroxymellein (3) (Fig. 1). 2. Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated as yellow amorphous powder, and showed a positive reaction with ferric chloride suggesting the presence of a phenol functionality. The IR spectrum of 1 showed strong absorption bands due to phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups (3474 cm�1) and a conjugated carbonyl group (1672 cm�1). The UV spectrum of 1 displayed absorptions (lmax) (log e) at 220 (4.28) and 314 (3.34), indicating the existence of oxy-aromatic systems, compatible with a dihydroisocoumarin structure (Pontius et al., 2008). Its elemental composition C11H10O6 with seven degrees of insaturation was deduced from its HRESIMS, which showed a deprotonated molecular ion ([M�H]�) at m/z 237.0381 (calcd for C11H9O6, 237.0399), consistent with its 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.phytol.2010.11.003 gHMBC NMR experiments enabled us to assign all 1H and 13C signals. The 13C NMR, DEPT 908, and 1H–13C gHMQC indicated that compound 1 had one methyl, four methines, and six quaternary carbons, including two carbonyl groups at d 169.5 and d 167.1, assigned toa carboxyl and toad-lactonegroups, respectively.The 1H NMR and 1H–1H gCOSY spectra of 1 showed two ortho-coupled hydrogens at d 7.04 (H-8) and d 8.10 (H-9), suggesting the presence of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring. The 1H–1H gCOSY spectrum indicated a spin system in 1 which included a methyl group atd 1.43 (H3C-10) coupled with an oxymethine hydrogen at d 4.72 (H-3), itselfcoupledwithamethinehydrogenatd5.47(H-4).Therefore,the aliphatic portion of 1 was unambiguously established as a H3C– CH(O–)–CH–OH chain. Long-range correlations observed in the gHMBC spectrum between H-7 (d 7.04) with C-6 (d 163.9), C-5 (d 108.7), and C-8a (d 120.0), between H-4 (d 5.47) with C-4a (d 144.8), C-5, C-8a and C-3 (d 78.2), as well as between H-8 (d 8.10) with C-6, C-1 (d 167.1) and C-4a enabled us to establish unequivocally the substitution pattern of the aromatic moiety of 1. A logical deduction ofthe datacollectedwouldobviouslyleadtothe structure1.SinceH- 3 and H-4 showed a coupling constant of 1.8 Hz, these protons had an axial–equatorial relationship. Thus, the relative stereochemistry of compound 1 was established as (3R*, 4R*). This relative conﬁguration at C-3 and C-4 was very similar when compared with data of similar isochromanes (Okuno et al., 1986; Aldridge et al., 1971). A comparison of the optical rotation of 1 ([a]D 28 �60.3, c 0.034, MeOH)withthe literature values reportedfor three of the four possible 4-hydroxymellein stereoisomers (Devys et al., 1980) indicated that (3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-mellein has both the signal and magnitude of optical rotation ([a]D �1.5) comparable to compound 1. Therefore, the absolute conﬁguration of 1 was assigned as (3R,4R) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Hence, the structure of compound 1 was completely elucidated, and established as (3R,4R)-3,4-dihydro-4,6- dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-oxo-1H-isochromene-5-carboxylic acid. In addition, two known dihydroisocoumarins were isolated from a Penicillium sp. and identiﬁed as (R)-7-hydroxymellein (2) and (3R,4R)-4,7-dihydroxymellein (3) (Djoukeng et al., 2009). Compounds 2 and 3 were identiﬁed by analysis of spectroscopic data, as well as of optical rotation data, with literature values. Both 2 and 3 exhibited a rare 7,8-dihydroxy substitution. To date, related compounds have been isolated from plant and fungi sources, including Azadirachta indica, Septoria nodorum, Cytospora eucalypticola, Nodulisporum sp. and Cephalosporium sp. (Devys et al., 1980; Siddiqui et al., 1988; Kokubun et al., 2003; Bi et al., 2006; Pontius et al., 2008). The cathecol moiety of 2 and 3 is probably formed after an additional oxidation at C-7, subsequently to the formation of the aromatic polyketide skeleton. Dihydroisocoumarins 1–3 were evaluated for their antifungal activity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and C. cladospor- ioides using direct bioautography assay (Table 1) (Rahalison et al., 1991). Compounds 2 and 3 showed a potent effect against the yeasts, exhibiting a detection limit of 5.00 and 10.0 mg against C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, respectively. Compound 1 exhibited moderate fungitoxicity towards C. cladosporioides and C. sphaerospermum, showing a detection limit of 10.0 and 25.0 mg, respectively. Altogether, these data indicate a clear positive correlation between the antifungal effect demonstrated by the dihydroisocoumarins and catechol moiety at C-7 and C-8. The identiﬁcation of the compounds 1–3, potentially bioactive against the phytopathogenic fungi, indicates that they act as defense of the host species against possible infection by pathogens. Although a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities has already been demonstrated for metabolites from Penicillium and Xylaria genera, few studies have been devoted to the acetylcholin- esterase inhibitory activity of this class of pentaketides. Com- pounds 2 and 3 showed a limit of detection of 10 mg in a TLC-based AChE inhibition assay which was considered as weakly potent. Dihydroisocoumarin 1 displayed moderate AChE inhibitory activity, exhibiting a detection limit of 3.0 mg. In conclusion, three dihydrocoumarin derivatives, one new from Xylaria sp. and two known from Penicillium sp., associated with P. aduncum and A. macrophylla leaves, respectively, have been isolated and identiﬁed and exhibited antifungal and AChE inhibitory activities. The results herein reported suggest that dihydrocoumarins should be considered as potential lead com- pounds in the development of new agrochemicals and/or hit compounds for use in the drug design for Alzheimer’s disease treatment. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedures 1H NMR (500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz), gHMBC, gHMQC and gCOSY experiments were recorded on a VARIAN DRX-500 spectrometer, using the non-deuterated residual signal as refer- ence. Mass spectra were measured on a LC–MS Q-TOF Micromass spectrometer, using the ESI mode and MeOH–H2O (1:1) as eluent (cone voltage 25 V). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254. Spots on TLC plates were visualized under UV light and by spraying with anisalde- hyde–H2SO4 reagent followed by heating at 120 8C. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Varian Prep-Star 400 system using a Phenomenex C18 (250 mm � 21.2 mm) preparative column. Ana- lytical HPLC was performed on a Varian Pro Star 230 HPLC system using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm � 4.6 mm).

Optical rotations were measured with PerkinElmer polarimeter with sodium lamp operating at 589 nm at 28 8C. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated A. macrophylla K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) and P. aduncum L. (Piperaceae) were collected in ‘‘Estac¸a˜o Ecolo´gica Experimental de Mogi-Guac¸u, Fazenda Campininha’’, Mogi-Guac¸u, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, in November 2003. The botanical identiﬁcations were assigned by Dr. Ineˆs Cordeiro (Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil), and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher no. SP 370915 and Cordeiro PAO, respectively). 3.3. Isolation and identiﬁcation of the endophytes Adult and healthy leaves of P. aduncum and A. macrophylla were selected and submitted to surface sterilization. Leaves were ﬁrst washed with water and soap, then immersed in a 1% aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and in 70% aqueous EtOH for 1 min. A second washing with water and soap was performed and ﬁnally the leaves were immersed in sterile water for 10 min. The sterilized leaves were cut into 2 � 2 cm pieces and deposited on a Petri dish containing PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) and anthamicine sulfate (50 mg/mL), 3–4 pieces on each dish. The material of the two species was incubated at 25 8C for 10 days and the endophytes Penicillium sp. and Xylaria sp. were isolated by successive inoculation in Petri dishes from Alibertia macrophyla and P. aduncum, respectively (Silva et al., 2006). The fungus Penicillium sp. was identiﬁed by Dr. Derlene Attili de Angelis (CPQBA-UNICAMP – Centro Pluridisciplinar de Pesquisas Quı´micas, Biolo´ gicas e Agrı´colas, Campinas, Brazil) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number 05070032-C. The fungus Xylaria sp. was identiﬁed by Prof. Dr. Ludwing H. Pfenning (Universidade Federal de Lavras, Departamento de Fitopatologia) and deposited in the NuBBE collection under the number PA-01. 3.4. Growth of Xylaria sp. and extraction The strain was inoculated in twenty Erlenmeyers (500 mL each) containing each one: 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose (PDB) in 300 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved at 121 8C for 15 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 8C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, for 28 days. The mycelia biomass accumulated in the Erlenmeyers was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration, and the ﬁltrate was subjected to a liquid–liquid partition with EtOAc (3� 2 L). The EtOAc fraction was evaporated resulting in the crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g). 3.4.1. Extraction and isolation of compound 1 The crude EtOAc extract (4.0 g) was puriﬁed by column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 gel, eluting with MeOH, to afford 08 fractions (F-1–F-8, 100 mL portions). Compound 1 (175.0 mg) was obtained from fractions F-6 to F-7 as a yellow amorphous powder. 3.5. Growth of Penicillium sp. and growth medium extraction The Penicillium sp. strain was inoculated in nine Erlenmeyers (500 mL each), containing each one: 90 g of corn meal in 75 mL of sterilized H2O. The medium was autoclaved four times (four consecutive days) at 121 8C for 40 min. After cooling, the medium was inoculated with the endophyte and incubated at 25 8C in still mode during 21 days. At the end of the growth period, the solid cultures were ground and extracted with MeOH (6� 250 mL). The MeOH was evaporated, to give 15 g of the MeOH extract. The MeOH extract was dissolved in MeCN and then subjected to liquid– liquid partition with hexane. The MeCN fraction was evaporated to give 6.0 g of a MeCN-deffated extract. 3.5.1. Extraction and Isolation of compounds 2 and 3 The MeCN-deffated fraction obtained (6.0 g) was fractionated using a C18 reversed-phase CC, eluted with a gradient of MeOH in H2O (5–100% MeOH), to afford 16 fractions (Fr1–Fr16). Fraction Fr- 2 (218.0 mg) was further separated using RP-HPLC [l = 254 nm, 10.0 ml/min, 8:2 H2O–MeCN (80 min)], to give compounds 2 (6.3 mg, Rt = 40.3 min) and 3 (6.1 mg, Rt = 30.0 min).

Antifungal activity Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. Compounds 1–3 were applied on pre-coated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 mL) containing 100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 10.0, 5.00 and 1.00 mg samples of pure compounds. After eluting with CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the plates were sprayed with the fungi suspension (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was used as a positive control at 1.0 mg. 3.7. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity Acetylcholinesterase (1000 U) was dissolved in 150 mL of 0.05 M Tris–hydrochloric acid buffer at pH 7.8. Bovine serum albumin (150 mg) was added to the solution in order to stabilize the enzyme during the biochemical assay. The stock solution was kept at 4 8C. TLC plates were eluted with an appropriate solvent (acetone or isopropanol) in order to clean the plates before drying at 30 8C. After elution of samples in CHCl3:MeOH (85:15), the TLC plates were dried at 30 8C for complete removal of solvent. The plates were then sprayed with enzyme stock solution and carefully dried at r.t. again. For incubation of the enzyme, the plate was deposited ﬂat over plastic plugs in a covered plastic tank containing a small amount of H2O, in order to keep the humidity constant. The incubation of plates was performed at 37 8C for 20 min. For detection of the AChE inhibitory activity, solutions of 1- naphthyl acetate (250 mg) in EtOH (100 mL) and of Fast Blue B salt (400 mg) in distilled water (160 mL) were prepared immediately before use. After incubation of the TLC plate, 10 mL of the naphthyl acetate solution and 40 mL of the Fast Blue B salt solution were mixed and sprayed onto the plate to give a purple coloration after 1–2 min (if positive). Galantamine was employed as positive control 1.0 mg (Marston et al., 2002).
