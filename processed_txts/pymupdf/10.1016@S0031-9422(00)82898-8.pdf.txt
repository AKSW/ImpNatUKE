In one species  the lignanea (-)-lirioresino1-C  and (+)-G.Gdimethyllirioresinol-B  were also enmuntered.  IN CONTINUATION  of previous work’ directed towards a complete chemo-taxonomic  survey2  of the genus Aspidospenna a further series of species has been studied. In general the alkaloids  isolated belong to well-defined groups, already found in the genus and normally characteristic  of the botanical sub-group~.~ Thus, for example, the sub-group Nitida (A. rig&,  nitidim,  and marcgraviamun) is characterized  by indolic alkaloids of the heteroyohimbine  and  corynantheol  types, while the Pyricolla (A. pyricohn  and nigricans) and Tomentosa sub  groups contain as principal constituents uleine and related alkaloids.  The appearance of  (+>stemmadenine  (I) previously found in the genera Stemmadenia’ and Melodin&  is  noteworthy  for although it is a natural precursor  of the aspidospermatidine  group of  alkaloids based on structure (II), it had not been previously encountered in Aspidiwpema.  Picraline (III), 5* 6 isolated for the fh-st time from this genus, is closely related to alkaloids  found earlier, for example, aspidodasycarpine  (IV). 7 A list of the alkaloids is given in the  Table.  *Present address: Facultad de Ciencias, Escuela de Quhica,  Universidad Central de Venezuela,  Caram&vsaauela.  1 For leading referams  see B.

The former again appeared as a major  constituent of the wood. In addition to the alkaloids recorded in the table, the lignanes  (-)&ioresinoEC  (XVII)zs* 26 and (+)-O,OdimethyIlirioresinol-B  (XVfH)zs* 27*28 were  isolated.  12-Hydroxy-Kacetylaspidospermatidine (XVI) (see Table note??) the N-acetyl anaiogue  of Iimatine (XlX)2q was characterized as a 7-hy~oxy-~-~~~hydroindole  by its i.r. and  U.V. absorption .= NMR and mass spectra1 data were consistent with structure (XVI), the  precisely determined mass of the molecular ion, 324.18367 confirming the molecular formula,  C&-#~NsO~. Location of the ethyhdene sidechain at position 14 was con&-med by the  appearance of the C-3 proton as a singlet (452 ppm) superimposed on the C-2 proton  quartet, as well as by tire mass spectral breakdown of the hydrogenation product, 14,19-  ~hydr~~~hydroxy-~-a~~I~pidos~~tidine  (XX). The diagnostic peaks in dihydro-  aspidospermatidine (XXI) have been showngo to occur at m/e 199 and 227, the latter having  twice the intensity of the former. These peaks appear in the spectrum of (XX) at m/e  257.12921 (CtsHt7N202+) and 28516019 (C17H2tN20z+, fragment o; accompauied by b,  m/e 243) with the same relative intensities as found in the case of (XXI).  The absolute co~~tion  of alkaloids of the ~pidos~~atidine  group has been related  to their ORD c~rves.~~ The negative sign of the main Cotton effect (below 290 nm) of  (f)-12-hydroxy-Ar-acetylaspidospennatidine (XVI) is indicative of C-6 alpha at C-7 as in  (+)-limatine (XIX)2q* 31 (see Ref. 23).  a, R=COCHa  m/e 285  b, R=H  m/e 243  16 G.
