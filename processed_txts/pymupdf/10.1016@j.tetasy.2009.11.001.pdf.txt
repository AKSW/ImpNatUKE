Introduction Interest in integrating traditional organic chemistry and bioca- talysis has increased dramatically over the past decade.1 Biocata- lytic reactions that employ either enzymes or whole cells are well suited for green chemistry because mild conditions are ap- plied in these reactions by lowering the energy requirements; few- er by-products are formed as they are highly chemo-, regio- and stereoselective, and multi-step chemical syntheses can be achieved in just a few steps via biocatalysis.2 As a result, biocatalytic pro- cesses are often cheaper and more direct than their chemical counterparts.3 The use of microorganisms is advantageous because of the growth and easy formation of the multienzymatic system.4 One crucial aspect to be considered for a successful microbial biotrans- formation is the selection of the natural source to be studied. In this work, whole cells from three ﬁlamentous fungi and two endo- phytic fungi were tested as biocatalysts. Endophytic fungi are an unexplored or at least under-explored source for microbial biotransformations.5 Therefore, as a part of our research program focusing on the study of the biocatalytic potential of ﬁlamentous fungi, we herein report the biotransformation of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1 and aceto- phenone 2, two well-known pro-chiral ketones, by the ﬁlamentous fungi Botrytis cinerea, Trichoderma viride and Eutypa lata, and the endophytic microorganisms Colletotrichum crassipes and Xylaria sp., in order to detect monooxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities.6,7 2. Results and discussion The selected set of ﬁve fungal species mentioned above was used in the screening of microbial biocatalysts to detect monooxy- genase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities. The reduction of 4- ethylcyclohexanone 1 to 4-ethylcyclohexanol 1a was used as the ﬁrst reaction in the screening. 2.1. Biotransformation of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1 4-Ethylcyclohexanone 1 was subjected to the action of whole cells of ﬁve ﬁlamentous fungi, B. cinerea, E. lata, T. viride, C. crassipes and Xylaria sp. to verify the biocatalytic potential of these fungi in the biotransformation of ketones. The results of the biotransforma- tions are presented in Tables 1 (static cultures) and 2 (shaken cultures) in terms of isolated yields and the predominant conﬁgurations of the products obtained. Shaken cultures were in- cluded in order to observe differences resulting from the degree of oxidation. 0957-4166/$ - see front matter � 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 20 (2009) 2666–2672 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Tetrahedron: Asymmetry journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/tetasy Following a period of incubation for each fungus, several bio- transformation products 1a–1e were detected. Product structure assignment was done by NMR analysis as described in Section 4. 4-Ethylcyclohexanone 1 was reduced to the corresponding cis- and trans-alcohols8 (Scheme 1). As shown in Tables 1 and 2, B. cine- rea and C. crassipes gave the trans-4-ethylcyclohexanol trans-1a with a cis–trans ratio of 0:100, and E. lata with a cis–trans ratio of 3:97 and a yield of �47%. cis-alcohol 1a was produced by T. viride with a cis–trans ratio of 65:35. Most of the biotransformations oc- curred with low conversion because several products were formed. 1b OH O HO O OH HO 1d 1e In addition to the bioreduction of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1, B. cinerea and C. crassipes produced 4-(1-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanol 1b.9 B. cinerea gave the trans-isomer with 56.1% ee. In contrast, C. crassipes afforded the cis-isomer suggesting that the compound cis-4-ethyl- cyclohexanol cis-1a was hydroxylated by this fungus on the ethyl group. The stereoselective formation of carbon–carbon bonds is one of the key transformations in synthetic organic chemistry and is gain- ing increasing attention. Enzymatic systems belonging to the lyase class such as pyruvate decarboxylases are capable of carrying out acyloin-type condensation reactions in water under mild condi- tions, in turn leading to chiral a-hydroxy ketones which are versa- tile building blocks for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. In some cases, these a-hydroxy ketones are not isolated but an er- ythro diol is formed instead.10 Thus, compound 1c was obtained from biotransformation by T. viride and E. lata as a colourless oil with an M+ peak at m/z 172 and featuring a 13C NMR spectrum consistent with the molecular for- mula C10H20O2. The 1H NMR spectrum was close to that of 4-ethyl- cyclohexanol 1a, but the appearance of two signals at 74.6 and 17.1 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum (C-9 and C-10, respectively) and two signals at 1.15 and 3.52 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum showed that 1c presented another hydroxylated ethyl group. The trans disposition was deduced from NOE interactions H-4/H-10. The absolute conﬁguration at C-9 was determined via the Mosher ester analysis protocol.11 In particular, derivatization of 1c with (R)- and (S)-a-methoxy-a-phenylacetic (MPA) acids followed by 1H NMR analysis of the resulting diastereomeric esters (S)-MPA- 1c and (R)-MPA-1c revealed a negative d (dR � dS) value for H-10 (�0.14) and positive d (dR � dS) values for H-2 and H-4 (+0.10 and +0.46, respectively). Following MPA rules, these data indicated an S-conﬁguration for C-9 in 1c which is consistent with Prelog’s rule.12 This compound, trans-4-ethyl-1-(1S-hydroxyethyl)cyclo- hexanol (1c), is reported here for the ﬁrst time.

C. Pinedo-Rivilla et al. / Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 20 (2009) 2666–2672 2667 The formation of 1c can be explained assuming the formation of a C–C bond by means of an enzyme-type pyruvate decarboxylase leading to a chiral a-hydroxy ketone. The two-carbon unit originat- ing from the decarboxylation of pyruvate is transferred to the ke- tone substrate. Presumably, an alcohol dehydrogenase present in the whole cell stereoselectively reduces the ketone of the acyloin and an erythro diol is formed instead. This is the ﬁrst time that an acyloin-type enzymatic reaction with a ketone as substrate is reported. We propose the mechanism showed in Scheme 2. Another interesting transformation of 1 was oxidation at tertiary carbon C-4 by the endophytic fungus Xylaria sp. which is unusual for fungal biotransformations. 4-Ethyl-4-hydroxycyclo- hexanone 1d had been previously prepared13 but it is reported here for the ﬁrst time as a biotransformation product. The biotransformation of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1 by the endo- phytic fungi Xylaria sp. and C. crassipes also produced another com- pound, 1e, whose 13C NMR spectrum was consistent with the molecular formula C8H14O2, exhibiting signals for one methyl, four methylene, two methyne and one quaternary carbon. The 1H NMR spectrum was close to that of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1, but the presence of a signal at 70.7 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum (C-7) and two signals at 3.73 ppm (q, 1H) and 1.25 ppm (d, 3H) in the 1H NMR spectrum suggest that this compound was hydroxylated at C-7. The stereochemistry of this product was conﬁrmed by means of the corresponding Mosher esters.11 According to this method, we analysed the 1H NMR spectra of the MPA esters of compound 1e resulting from the biotransformation by Xylaria sp. on surface cultures at 10 days. The positive value of DdRS for H-8 (+0.15) and the negative value of DdRS for H-4 and H-6 (�0.59 and �0.14, respectively) indicate an R conﬁguration for this com- pound, with ½a�25 D ¼ �3:5 (c 1.0, CHCl3). The same compound 1e ob- tained from C. crassipes showed a positive value for ½a�25 D , suggesting an S-conﬁguration for C-7. 4-(1-Hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanone 1e had been previously pre- pared14 but its absolute conﬁguration is reported here for the ﬁrst time. These compounds 1d and 1e were only obtained by the endo- phytic fungi Xylaria sp. and C. crassipes, indicating the different bio- catalytic potential of these fungi. 2.2. Biotransformation of acetophenone 2 Acetophenone 2 was biotransformed by whole cells of ﬁve ﬁla- mentous fungi, B. cinerea, E. lata, T. viride, C. crassipes and Xylaria sp. to verify the biocatalytic potential of these fungi for the biotrans- formation of aromatic ketones (Scheme 3). The results of the bio- transformations are presented in Tables 3 (static cultures) and 4 (shaken cultures) in terms of isolated yields, enantiomeric excesses and the predominant conﬁgurations of the products obtained. Sha- ken cultures were included in order to observe the differences due to the degree of oxidation in the compounds obtained. In order to evaluate the alcohol dehydrogenase activity for each fungus under study, we selected the time for the biotransforma- tion. The absolute conﬁgurations were attributed by comparison with those from the literature.15,16 The most enantioselective strain for the bioreduction reaction was B. cinerea, which gave (S)-1-phenylethanol (S)-2a15 with high enantiomeric excess (85%) and conversion (54.3%) on surface cul- tures, and 92% ee and 23% yield on shaken cultures. The (S)-conﬁg- uration is consistent with Prelog’s rule.12 T. viride showed enantiopreference for the (R)-alcohol (R)-2a with a high enantio- meric excess (79%). Therefore, depending on the conﬁguration of the chiral alcohol required, either B. cinerea or T. viride can be used. The data presented in tables show that the enantiomeric excess decreased with the fermentation time, except for the shaken cul- ture of B. cinerea. This is because in both cases the highest enantio- meric excess was reached after ﬁve days. It is interesting to note that C. crassipes was the only fungus which gave the hydroxylation product of 2a at C-2, phenyle- thane-1,2-diol 2b,16 with (S)-conﬁguration and high enantiomeric excess.

Conclusions In summary, the studies described above demonstrate the bio- catalytic potential of the ﬁlamentous fungi B. cinerea, T. viride, E. lata, C. crassipes and Xylaria sp. in obtaining biotransformation com- pounds with high enantiomeric purity from prochiral ketones. The main reaction paths involved reduction and hydroxylations at sev- eral positions including tertiary carbons. The latter case is not very typical in fungal biotransformations. Thus, 4-ethyl-4-hydroxycy- clohexanone 1d is obtained by the endophytic fungus Xylaria sp. 4-Ethylcyclohexanone 1 was reduced to the corresponding cis and trans-alcohols by all the fungi with medium to high enantiomeric purity, except by Xylaria sp. B. cinerea was very effective in the biore- duction of both substrates leading to the chiral alcohol (S)-1-phenyl- ethanol (S)-2a with up to 90% enantiomeric excess and the ratio of cis- and trans-4-ethylcyclohexanol 1a was shown to be 0:100. Moreover, the absolute conﬁgurations of the compounds trans- 4-ethyl-1-(1S-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanol 1c and 4-(1R-hydroxy- ethyl)cyclohexanone 1e were determined by NMR analysis of the corresponding Mosher’s esters. The ﬁrst one, 1c, reported here for the ﬁrst time, was obtained through biotransformation by T. viride and E. lata by means of an atypical acyloin-type reaction. The high yields observed for Eutypa and its ability to carry out an unreported acyloin-type reaction seem to indicate that this fun- gus could be a potential biocatalyst. 4. Experimental 4.1. General experimental procedures Optical rotations were determined using a Perkin–Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on a Mattson Genesis spec- trophotometer, series FTIR. 1H and 13C NMR measurements were obtained on Varian Gemini 300 and Varian Unity 400 NMR spec- trometers with SiMe4 as the internal reference. Mass spectra were recorded on a GC–MS Thermoquest spectrometer (model: Voyager) and a VG Autospec-Q spectrometer. HPLC was performed with a Hitachi/Merck L-6270 apparatus equipped with a UV–vis detector (L 6200) and a differential refractometer detector (RI-71). TLC was performed on Merck Kiesegel 60 F254, 0.2 mm thick. Silica gel (Merck) was used for column chromatography. Puriﬁcation by means of HPLC was accomplished with a silica gel column (Hi- bar 60, 7 m, 1 cm wide, 25 cm long). Chemicals were products of Fluka or Aldrich. All solvents used were freshly distilled. 4.2. Microorganism cultures The B. cinerea culture employed in this work, B. cinerea (UCA 992), was obtained from grapes from the Domecq vineyard, Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz, Spain. This culture of B. cinerea is deposited in the Universidad de Cadiz, Facultad de Ciencias, Mycological Her- barium Collection (UCA). The E. lata and T. viride cultures used were obtained from the ‘Colección Española de Cultivos Tipo’ (CECT), Facultad de Biología, Universidad de Valencia, Spain, where cultures of these strains are deposited. C. crassipes and Xylaria sp. were isolated as endophytes from the plant Casearia sylvestris (Flacourtiaceae) from Cerrado do Estado de São Paulo (Brazil).17 These strains are deposited in the Herbário do Instituto de Botânica de São Paulo (Brazil). 4.3. Determination of enantiomeric purity The enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric excesses of 1b were determined by chiral GC analyses on a Cyclosil-B, 30 m � 0.25 mm � 0.25 lm column using a Perkin–Elmer, Clarus 400 gas chro- matograph; split at 50 mL/min, ﬂow rate 1.1 mL/min, hydrogen as a gas carrier; trans-(major)-1b tR = 4.76 min, trans-(minor)-1b tR = 5.87 min; cis-(minor)-1b tR = 4.54 min, cis-(major)-1b tR = 4.75 min. The enantiomeric purity of 2a and 2b was determined by means of HPLC analyses on a chiral column (Chiralcel OD, Daicel, Japan): 254 nm, 0.8 mL/min, hexane/isopropanol (9:1); (R)-2a tR = 7.4 min, (S)-2a tR = 8.6 min, (R)-2b tR = 20.6 min, (S)-2b tR = 22.0 min. The absolute conﬁgurations were attributed by comparison with those from the literature.15,16 4.4. General procedure for biotransformation Fungi were grown at 25 �C on a Czapeck-Dox medium (B. cinerea UCA 992) or on a PDB medium (T. viride, E. lata, C. crassipes and Xylar- ia sp.) (150 mL per bottle and 200 mL per ﬂask). The shaken cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker at 140 rpm. The substrates were dissolved in ethanol and then distributed over Roux bottles or ﬂasks (150 ppm per ﬂask) and the fermentation continued for a further period, after which the mycelium was ﬁltered and then washed with brine and ethyl acetate. The broth was extracted three times with ethyl acetate and the extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sul- fate. The solvent was then evaporated and the residue was chro- matographed ﬁrst on a silica gel column and then with HPLC with an increasing gradient of ethyl acetate to petroleum ether. 4.5.
