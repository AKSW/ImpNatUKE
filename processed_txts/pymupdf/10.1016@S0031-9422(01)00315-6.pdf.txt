Keywords: Peritassa campestris; Hippocrateaceae; Sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids; 4-Hydroxy-7-epi-chuchuhuanine E-V 1. Introduction Sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids, based on a highly oxygenated dihydro-b-agarofuran core on a sesquiterpene moiety, and evoninoate or wilfordate esters on their alka- loid moiety, constitute a relatively small group of natural products frequently found in plants of the Celastraceae family (Bru¨ ning and Wagner, 1978). Recently, these alka- loids have also been described in plants of the Hippocra- teaceae (Mata et al., 1990; Lia˜ o et al., 1997). This chemical aspect reinforces the recent botanical classiﬁcation in which the two families, Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae, appear to be grouped in the Celastraceae (Bru¨ ning and Wagner, 1978; Heywood, 1993). These alkaloids have also been of interest due to their cytotoxicity against several human tumour cell lines (Kuo et al., 1994), and their insect antifeedant, and insecticidal activities (Shir- ota et al., 1994). Sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids iso- lated from Tripterygium species have also shown immunosuppressive activity (Zheng et al., 1989). As part of our continuing search for bioactive com- pounds from plants, especially from the savanna, we investigated the MeOH and EtOAc soluble portions of the crude extract of the roots of Peritassa campestris Cambess. (Hippocrateaceae), a plant that occurs in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), popularly known as ‘‘bacupari do campo’’, and which is used in folk medi- cine for wound healing in the form of a decoction (Sep- tı´mio, 1994). In this paper we report the isolation and structure elucidation of a new sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloid, 4-hydroxy-7-epi-chuchuhuanine E-V (1), and the isolation of nine known alkaloids forrestine (Chun- quan et al., 1992), euonimine, ebenifoline E-I, euojapo- nine F, euonine (Itokawa et al., 1993), wilforine (Beroza, 1951), wilforjine (Deng et al., 1992), neowilforine (He et al., 1989), and wilforzine (He et al., 1987). 2. Results and discussion 4-Hydroxy-7-epi-chuchuhuanine E-V (1) was isolated as a colorless amorphous solid, in low yield, and its IR spectrum displayed absorptions at 3614, 1740, and 1583 cm�1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra suggested a dihy- dro-b-agarofuran sesquiterpene skeleton with an evo- ninic diester bridge. The sesquiterpene moiety was characterised in the 1H NMR spectrum by tertiary methyl groups at � 1.67 (3H, s, Me-14) and � 1.58 (3H, d, J=1.2 Hz, Me-12), coupling with one hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl group at � 4.50 (q, J=1.2 Hz, OH-4), two sets of methylene protons at � 4.62 (d, J=13.6 Hz, H-11a), � 5.28 (d, J=13.6 Hz, H-11b), � 3.67 (d, J=11.6 Hz, H- 15a) and � 5.98 (d, J=11.6 Hz, H-15b), seven methine protons at � 5.43 (d, J=4.0 Hz, H-1), 4.07 (dd, J=4.0 0031-9422/01/$ - see front matter # 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

A further oxygenated functional group was assumed to be a hydroxyl group, based on a broad singlet at � 3.65 (exchanged with D2O). The evoninic acid fragment in 1 was assigned by the signals at � 8.05 (dd, J=8.0 and 2.0 Hz, H-40), 7.26 (dd, J=8.0 and 4.8 Hz, H-50) and 8.69 (dd, J=4.8 and 2.0 Hz, H-60), corresponding to a 2,3-disubstituted pyr- idine unit. It also contains two secondary methyl groups at � 1.38 (d, J=6.8 Hz, Me-90) and 1.15 (d, J=7.2 Hz, Me-100), coupled with two methine protons at � 4.66 (dq, J=6.8 and 1.0 Hz, H-70) and 2.53 (dq, J=7.2 and 1.0 Hz, H-80). This sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloid includes one macrocyclic structure formed by two ester linkages between one sesquiterpene molecule and one evoninic acid, at positions 3 and 15. In order to determine the positions of the acetate groups and consequently the hydroxyl group position, 1H–1H COSY, HMQC and HMBC spectra were recorded. In the former the cross- peak of H-2 (� 4.07) with H-1 (� 5.43) and H-3 (� 4.76), suggested the position of the hydroxyl group at C-2, which reinforced by the observation that H-2 was at higher ﬁeld than the corresponding proton in alkaloids containing a benzoyl or acetyl group, attached to this position. This proposal was conﬁrmed by the HMBC spectrum which located the acetate groups by cross- peaks between these groups and H-1, H-5, H-7, H-8, and H-11. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 36 signals, characteristic of evoninoate sesquiterpene pyridine alka- loids and showing ﬁve acetate groups. The carbon attached to the hydroxyl group appeared at � 69.65, approximately � 1.0 deshielded when compared with alka- loids with an acetate group at carbon 2. Additional sup- port was obtained by a full scan ESI mass spectrum, where the molecular ion peak for this compound was detected at m/z 764 ([M+H]+), reinforcing this structural proposal. The relative stereochemistry around the dihydroagar- ofuran nucleus was determined from the coupling con- stants to be the same as other alkaloids isolated, including wilforine, wherein the stereochemistry was determined by X-ray analysis (Lia˜ o et al., 1997). The C- 7 epimeric relationship between this compound and chuchuhuanine E-V (1a), was deﬁned by the coupling constant between H-7 and H-8. While in 1 this coupling constant was 6.0 Hz, in 1a it was 9.4 Hz (Shirota et al., 1994), indicating a cis and trans H-7/H-8 relationship for 1 and 1a, respectively. Alkaloid 1 was assayed for lethality in the brine shrimp toxicity (BST) test, and showed LC50 99.0 mg/ml. This test is proposed as a simple bioassay for natural product research, which active compounds could then be subjected to more elaborate bioassays for speciﬁc pharmacological activities. Sesquiterpene pyridine alka- loids was assayed against several tumor cell lines, and emarginatine F turned out to be active against some cell lines (Kuo et al., 1994). 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedures NMR: Bruker DRX 400, in CDCl3 and TMS as int. standard; ESI-MSMS: low resolution on a triple quad- rupole Micromass Quattro LC instrument, equipped with a ‘‘Z-spray’’ ion source; HRMS were obtained on a Fisons VG Autospec; [a]D: Perkin-Elmer 241 instru- ment; DCCC: Tokyo Rikakikai Co. with 300 columns of 40 cm�2 mm i.d. 3.2. Plant material Roots of P. campestris were collected in a Savanna Reserve at Universidade Federal de Sa˜ o Carlos, in Octo- ber 1992 and identiﬁed by Dr. Maria Helena de O. Antunes, Departamento de Botaˆ nica, Universidade Fed- eral de Sa˜ o Carlos, Sa˜ o Paulo, Brazil, wherein a voucher specimen (no. 2845) is deposited. 3.3. Extraction and isolation The roots were dried, powdered (2.8 kg) and succes- sively extracted with hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH at room temperature. The combined extracts were sub- mitted to liquid-liquid partition, resulting in hexane (5.1 g), methanol (35.84 g), ethyl acetate (5.87 g), n-butanol (5.21 g), and aqueous (23.80 g) extracts. The methanolic extract (3.5 g) was submitted to droplet countercurrent chromatography (DCCC), using the aqueous layer of hexane:MeOH:H2O:EtOAc (5:4:1:2) as the stationary and the organic layer as the mobile phase, in a ﬂow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The collected fractions were monitored by TLC and grouped in 22 fractions. Fractions 20–22 were separately ﬁltered on Florisil (70–230 mesh) using hexane:CH2Cl2:MeOH (8:2:0.5). Fraction 20 was ﬂash chromatographed on silica gel (230–400 mesh), eluting with hexane: CH2Cl2:MeOH (8:2:0.5), aﬀording wilforine 1206 L.M. Lia˜o et al. / Phytochemistry 58 (2001) 1205–1207 (330.0 mg, 9.428%) and a mixture of sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids. Fraction 22 was submitted to recy- cling HPLC using a GS-310P column (MeOH; 50.0� 2.15; 3 ml/min; UV 254 nm), aﬀording euojaponine F (15.7 mg, 0.448%), wilforjine (5.9 mg, 0.168%), wilfor- zine (3.5 mg, 0.100%), and another mixture of alka- loids. The ethyl acetate extract (3.0 g) was also submitted to DCCC, using the aqueous layer of CHCl3: MeOH:n-BuOH:H2O (10:10:1:6) as the stationary and the organic layer as the mobile phase, in a ﬂow rate of 0.6 ml/min, and after TLC was grouped in 12 fractions. Fractions 3, 4 and 5, after Florisil ﬁltration, were indivi- dually submitted to recycling HPLC under the same con- ditions as the methanol extract, aﬀording forrestine (186.8 mg, 6.226%), wilforine (50.1 mg, 1.670%), euojaponine F (0.4 mg, 0.013%), euonine (4.2 mg, 0.140%), neowilforine (4.3 mg, 0.143%), euonimine (6.1 mg, 0.203%), and a mixture of sesquiterpene pyridine alkaloids. The mixtures of alkaloids obtained were monitored by TLC using the Dragendorﬀ reagent and grouped into two sets. The second set was rechromatographed on recycling HPLC using a Shim-pack column (silica 5 m; 2.0�25 cm; hex- ane: CH2Cl2:MeOH� (8:2:0.5); 3 ml/min; UV 254 nm), aﬀording the alkaloid 1 (1.5 mg, 0.023%) and ebenifoline E-I (2.0 mg, 0.038%). 3.4.
