Abstract-Vellozia  compacta contains  six new diterpenes  of the pimarane  type. Their structures  were deduced on the  basis of spectral data and chemical modification.  INTRODUCTION  The Velloziaceae  constitute  one of the most interesting  plant families occurring  in South America and Africa. The  family contains  ca 250 species  of perennial  herbs and  shrubs, of which the genus Vellozia Vand. contains  ca 140  species [ 11. These plants are found in rocky regions on dry  soil. They are ligneous, rooted superficially  to the soil and  they grow very slowly. In spite of their apparent  fragility  they attain a surprising  longevity. This may be partly due  to the terpenes  which are present  in large quantities  in  these plants  and which might act as chemical  defence  against predators  [2].  gf!-‘ o&k0  As part of our programme  on systematic phytochemical  investigation  of Brazilian Velloziaceae,  we wish to report  on the study of Vellozia compacta Martius ex Schultes, a  perennial  species widely distributed  in the State of Minas  Gerais, Brazil.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The hexane extract of roots, stem and leaf sheaths of V.  compacta  yielded  a series  of new diterpenes  of the  pimarane  type besides compactone  (1) and one diterpene  with a cleisthantane  skeleton (2). Substances  1 and 2 were  discussed  in our previous  works [3,4].  Characterization  of the new pimarane  type substances  (3-8) is reported  in  this paper.  In accordance  with  their  substitution  pattern,  the  compounds  listed can be divided into three groups.  Group I  The spectral  data  of compactol  (3) suggested  two  hydroxyl,  one vinyl and four tertiary methyl groups. This  information,  together  with  the  molecular  formula,  CzoH3,02,  obtained  from  the high  resolution  mass  spectrum  suggested  that 3 could be a diterpenoid  of the  pimarane type, similar to those found in this family during  our previous  studies [3].  A carbinol  methine  signal at 6 3.24 (1 H, dd, J = 9 and  5 Hz) accounted  for a secondary  hydroxyl  group.  The  multiplicity  of the signal  of the CHOH  proton  de-  monstrates  that it is flanked by two hydrogens  and, from  its coupling  constants,  an axial orientation  could  be  assigned  to it. Consequently,  the hydroxyl  group  is  equatorial.  / --\  \  &  \  A  0  I  2011  1  3 R=H  4 R=OH  CO,R  9 R=H  10 R=Me  12  2  R'  R  --\  &  \  '\ B  0  5 R=H,H;R'=P-OH  6 R=p-OH;R'=H,H  7 R=O,  R'=H,H  8 R=O;  R'=P-OH  14 R=H,H;R'=&OAc  15 R=O;  R'=&OAc  0 --\  (j;t”T  B  : A  0  13  2012  A. C. PINTO and C. BORGES  Oxidation  of compound  3 with Jones’ reagent afforded  9. The IR spectrum  of this compound  showed  a broad  absorption  in the region 3420--2950 cm ’ and a carbonyl  band at 1730 cm- ‘. strongly suggesting  the presence of a  carboxyl  group. Chemical  confirmation  of this assump-  tion was obtained  by methylation  (CH,N,)  leading to 10,  which showed,  in the IR, absorptions  for two carbonyl  groups  (1740 and 17 12 cm- ‘). The mass spectrum  of 10  presented  the molecular  ion at m/z 334 and an intense  peak at mjz 138 resulting from McLafferty  rearrangement  involving  the keto group and probably  the hydrogen  at  C-5.  Similar results were obtained  when 3 was oxidized  by  either PCC or PCD [5].  A confirmation  of structure  3 by oxidation  into com-  pactone  (1) failed. Reduction  of 1 with sodium borohyd-  ride in methanol  yielded an epimeric mixture of alcohols  (2: 1) in which compactol  (3) was the one major isolated.  Compactotriol  (4) was obtained  as colourless  prisms,  and shown  to have the formula  C,,H,,O,.  The IR  spectrum  showed a broad peak at 3350 cm  ’ (OH), it also  exhibited  a vinyl  band  at 905cm--‘.  The  ‘H NMR  spectrum  in pyridine-d,  was very similar  to that  of  compactol  (3) except for the presence of a pair of doublets  centred  at (S 3.10 (1H. J = 1 I Hz) and  3.44 (1 H, .I  = 11 Hz). due to the CH,OH  of C-18.  The 13C NMR spectrum  of 4 confirmed  its structure  with the carbon  resonances  being in agreement  with a  7P,Sfl-dihydroxypimarane  possessing  a hydroxymethyl  group at the C-18 equatorial  position.  This was deduced  from the chemical  shifts of Me-l 9 and C-S (fi 18.2 and  46.0, respectively  [6]).  Group II  The unsaturated  compounds  of this group comprise two  cx&unsaturated  pimarane ketones. The molecular formula  of 12,0-hydroxy-7-oxopimar-8(9),15-dien  (5). CZOH300Z,  was determined  by high resolution  mass spectrometry.  The IR spectrum  revealed the presence  of a conjugated  ketone  (1645 cm- ‘), hydroxyl  (3480 cm-‘)  and vinyl  (3080 and 910 cm- ‘) groups. The UV confirmed  the x,/1-  unsaturated  carbonyl  group [i. Fz” 252 nm (log E 4.15)].  The ‘H NMR spectrum, in deuterochloroform  showed  signals for four tertiary methyl groups (d 0.90, 0.95, 0.99  and 1.14), one tertiary  vinyl c5.05 (IH, dd, J = 18 and  1.5 Hz), 5.09 (lH,dd.J  = lOand 1.5 Hz)and  5.72 (lH,dd,  J = 18 and  10 Hz)] group  and one carbinolic  proton  6 3.66 (lH, t, J = 6 Hz). The multiplicity  of the carbinolic  proton signal and the magnitude  of its coupling constants  suggested  that the hydroxyl  group is pseudo-equatorial.  The stereochemistry  of the hydroxyl  at C-12 was con-  firmed by the high field position of the methyl group at C-  17 (6 19.8). The shielding  was attributed  to the strong y-  gauche effect of the hydroxyl  group (Table 1) [7].  The UV, IR and ‘H NMR spectra of 1 la-hydroxy-7-  oxopimar-X(9),15-dien  (6) were similar to those of 5. A  carbinol  methine  signal at 64.60 indicated  a secondary  hydroxyl  group. The low yield position  of the carbinolic  proton  of 6 suggested  that the CH_OH proton  might be  allylic  [S].  The  interrelation  between  the  secondary  hydroxyl  group  and ethylenic  linkage  was derived  by  oxidation  of 6 with PCC. The product,  7.1 l-dioxopimar-  8(9),15-diene  (7), exhibited,  in the UV, an absorption  at  2 :a;” 264 nm (log E 3.93) for an enedione  [9].  The stereochemistry  of the hydroxyl group at C-l 1 was  deduced from the ‘H NMR spectrum  of 6 in deuteropyr-  idine. The methyl group at C-20 suffered a downfield  shift  of b 0.23 on changing from deuterochloroform  to pyridine  solution, which establishes  its syndiaxial  relationship  with  the hydroxyl  group  [lo].  The A/B rrans junction  was  determined  by the positive  Cotton  effect for the WX*  transition  in the CD spectrum.  (0.334 mgjml in dioxane  [O] = + 7.830 at 326 nm).  Reduction  of 7 (structure  elucidation,  see below) with  sodium borohydride  in methanol  yielded the keto alcohol,  Table 1. 13C NMR  data  for compounds  1 and S-8 (25.2 MHz,  CDCI,,  1 and 4  C,D,N.
