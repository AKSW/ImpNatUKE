Introduction Rubiaceae is widely distributed in Brazilian main ecosystems (Amazon, Cerrado and Atlantic Forest). This family is well known due to economic and therapeutic importance of these species, spe- cially Coffea arabica and Cinchona ledgeriana [1- 2]. Reported chemical constituents of Rubiaceae revealed a great diversity of secondary metabolites such as iridoids, alkaloids, anthraquinones, flavonoids, phenolics derivatives, triterpenes and diterpenes [1]. Few chemical studies of Alibertia have been reported resulting in the isolation of several triterpenes [2-4], iridoids [5], flavonoids [6] and caffeic acid esters [2]. Alibertia sessilis (Vell.) K. Schum., popu- larly known as “marmelada-de-cachorro”, is dis- tributed in the states of Ceará, Mato Grosso, Goiás and Minas Gerais. The plant possesses fruits with succulent pulp, black when ripe, which are consumed by birds in general [7]. From the stems of A. sessilis we report the isolation of a mixture of lignan glycosides. The separation of (+)-lyoniresinol 3α-O-β-glu- copyranoside (1) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3α-O-β- glucopyranoside (2) by conventional methods such as silica gel and RP18 low pressure column chromatography was unsuccessful. However, it was quite easy and fast to purify each compound by preparative high-performance liquid chro- matography (HPLC). Reversed-phase HPLC is commonly used for the separation of com- pounds present in complex mixtures of plant extracts [8-9].  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was used to identify the compounds. Compound 1 exhibit antioxidant [10] and antitu- mor-promoting activities [11]. These com- pounds, whose chemical structures are given in Figure 1, are being reported for the first time in Rubiaceae. 55 Ecl.

K. Schum. (Rubiaceae) by preparative high-perform- ance liquid chromatography. An efficient and fast separation can be achieved with methanol-water (30:70, v/v). Their structures were identified as (+)-lyoniresinol 3α-O-β-glucopyranoside and (-)- lyoniresinol 3α-O-β-glucopyranoside, being reported for the first time in Rubiaceae. Keywords: Rubiaceae; Alibertia sessilis; enantiomeric aglycone lignans; HPLC. Experimental details Plant material Alibertia sessilis (Vell.) K. Schum. (Rubia- ceae) was collected in the Estação Ecológica Expe- rimental de Mogi-Guaçu, São Paulo State, Brazil in November 2003. A voucher specimen was deposit- ed at the Herbário do Instituto Botânico da Secreta- ria do Meio Ambiente de São Paulo (nº SP370.914). Apparatus The high-performance liquid chromato- graphy (HPLC) (Shimadzu, Japan) equipment used was a CLASS-VP Ver.5.41 system comprised a Shimadzu SPD10Avp UV detector, a Shimadzu LC-8ATvp Multisolvent Delivery System, a Shimadzu SCL-10Avp controller, a Shimadzu LC pump, a Degasser Shimadzu DGU-14A and a CLASS-VP Ver.5.41 workstation (Shimadzu, Japan). HPLC-grade methanol was purchased from J.T. Baker (Baker-Mallinckrodt, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). HPLC-grade water (18 MΩ cm) was obtained using a Millipore Milli-Q purification system (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA, USA). Extraction, fractionation and preparation of sample Dried and powered stems (50.0 g) of A. sessilis were successively extracted with ethanol at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure yielding 3.7 g of crude extract. This extract was dissolved in methanol- water (80:20, v/v) and partitioned with hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol to yield 0.5 g of hexa- ne extract, 1.4 g of ethyl acetate extract and 1.3 g of n-butanol extract after evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure.  The ethyl acetate extract was submitted to column chromatography using Sephadex LH-20. 56 Ecl. Quím., São Paulo, 31(4): 55-58, 2006 The column was eluted with methanol, to give 15 fractions reunited after thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis. Fractions 2-3 (146.4 mg) were subjected to chromatography on a RP18 column using a water-methanol gradient system affording iridoid geniposidic acid (11.8 mg), a derivative fenolic glycoside (6.7 mg) not yet identified and the mixture of lignans glycosides (36.6 mg). Separation procedure The separation of lignans was performed using a Phenomenex Luna RP18 (2) column (250 x 21.20 mm I.D. x 10 µm, Torrance, CA, USA) in a Rheodyne 7125 sample injector with a 2.0 mL sample loop (Rheodyne, Cotati, CA, USA). The mobile phase composed of methanol-water (30:70, v/v, isocratic system) was eluted using a flow-rate of 10.0 mL min-1, the injection volume was 1.0 mL. Pure lignans were examined by HPLC on an analytical column. The analysis was performed with a Phenomenex Luna RP18 (2) col- umn (250 x 4.6 mm I.D. x 5 µm, Torrance, CA, USA) in a Rheodyne 7125 sample injector with a 20 µL sample loop (Rheodyne, Cotati, CA, USA). The mobile phase composed of methanol-water (30:70, v/v, isocratic system) was eluted at a flow- rate of 1.0 mL min-1, the injection volume was 20 µL. For both preparative and analytical HPLC, the detector was set as 238 nm. Structural identification of the compounds The NMR spectra in CD3OD of all com- pounds were obtained using a Varian, INOVA 500 spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA), oper- ating at 500 MHz for 1H and 125 MHz for 13C, two-dimensional technique such as gCOSY (gra- dient chemical shift correlation spectroscopy), gHMQC (gradient heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence) and gHMBC (gradient heteronuclear Figure 1. Lignans glucosides isolated from the stems of Alibertia sessilis. multiple bond connectivity) were used to fully elu- cidate the structure of compounds. Chemical shifts were given in δ (ppm) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard.

Quím., São Paulo, 31(4): 55-58, 2006 Results and Discussion The crude extract from stems of A. sessilis was partitioned using hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol. The ethyl acetate extract afforded geniposidic acid, a derivative fenolic glycoside and a third compound. The 1H- and 13C-NMR data for this last showed overlapping signals, suggesting that third compound could be a diastereomeric mixture of lignans containing enantiomeric aglycone parts that were not sepa- rated. Conventional methods such as silica gel and RP18 low pressure column chromatography were not successful to separate this lignans. So, this partially purified sample was ana- lysed by HPLC and a series of experiments was per- formed to determine the optimal solvent system for the HPLC separation. The following systems were tested: methanol-water (35:65, 30:70, 25:75, v/v), and the separation time were: 18 min, 25 min and 42 min, respectively, for an analytical separation run. But, despite of first system has faster separation ti- me, the peaks concerning to lignans didn’t have go- od separation, and the third system had a long sepa- ration time. Agood and fast separation can be achie- ved with the system methanol-water (30:70, v/v). Another evidence that the mixture was com- posed of a enantiomeric aglycone parts is the iden- tical UV spectras with absorption maximum at 215 and 270 nm and one spot when analysed by TLC. The result obtained from the partially pu- rified sample of Alibertia sessilis by preparative HPLC is showed in Fig. 2.  Figure 2.

The peak 1 fraction was identified as (+)-lyoniresinol 3α-O-β-glucopy- ranoside (1) and the peak 2 fraction as (-)- lyoniresinol 3α-O-β-glucopyranoside (2).  Conclusions Reversed-phase HPLC was successful in the preparative separation of a mixture containing enantiomeric aglycone parts, it was easy and fast to purify each compound of the mixture. So, this study contributed significantly to improve the knowledge about secondary metabolites of more one species of Brazilian Cerrado, when these compounds are being reported for the first time in Rubiaceae.
