Engler included Hortia as the single Neotropical genus in the Toddalioideae subtribe Toddaliinae. However, the range of dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives found in H. brasiliana and H. oreadica show that they contain similar compounds to other species of Hortia and clearly point to their phytochemical afﬁnities with other Rutoideae species. � 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The ten species are distributed from Panama to the state of São Paulo, Brazil, with most of the species occurring in the Amazonian region. Vandelli (1788) ﬁrst described the genus based on numerous collections sent to him from Brazil (Minas Gerais state), without naming any species. De Candolle (1824) described Hortia brasiliana Vand. based on a specimen from Vandelli in the Jussieu herbarium, which was collected in southeastern Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro states. Saint- Hilaire (1824) described a shrub collected in Goiás and western Minas Gerais, and named it H. brasiliana (Vand.) H.S. He was aware that his name had been applied to an arborescent species by De Candolle (1824), but pointed out that he himself had not collected the specimens. Engler (1874) also attributed the name H. brasiliana Vand. to the shrubby species of central Brazil. In the same treatment he described a new arborescent species, Hortia arborea Engl. Recently, Groppo et al. (2005) showed that H. brasiliana and H. arborea represent the same arborescent species, and that H. brasiliana Vand. ex DC. is the correct name while H. arborea is a synonym. Albeit well known, the shrubby species of central Brazil remained unnamed, so Groppo et al. (2005) called it Hortia oreadica Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani. Our taxonomic interest in the Rutaceae motivated an investigation of the taproots, stem and leaves of H. oreadica and the stem, stem bark and leaves of H. brasiliana. The stem bark of H. oreadica could not be stripped away from the woody, thus they were analyzed together as stem. The population of H. brasiliana was small and root material was not collected as this might risk the survival of the trees. * Corresponding author. Tel.: þ55 16 3351 8093; fax: þ55 16 3351 8350.

General experimental procedures NMR: on a Bruker DRX-400 and ARX-200, with TMS as internal standard; IR: Bomen-Ft/IR; UV: Varian 500 Scan UV–VIS– NIR; [a]D: Perkin Elmer 241 instrument; R-HPLC: Recycling High-Performance Liquid Chromatography on a model Shimadzu SCL-10A; the column used was a Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G; eluant: MeOH 100%; ﬂow rate: 3.0 mL min�1; detection (Shimadzu SCL-10A): UV l 254 nm; High Speed Countercurrent Chromatography (HSCCC): on a P.C. Inc., Potomac, MD 20854, USA; Elemental analyses: on an EA 1108, CHNS-O (Fisons); GC–MS: low resolution on an HP-2576 instrument; ESI-MSMS: Micromass Quattro LC instrument equipped with a “Z-spray” ion source. 2.2. Plant material H. brasiliana Vand. Ex. D.C. was collected (May 2000) in Linhares, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. H. oreadica Groppo, Kallunki & Pirani was collected (Sep 2005) in the Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve, Itacoatiara, Amazonas state, Brazil. All the plants were identiﬁed by Prof. Dr. José Rubens Pirani of the Department of Botany, University of São Paulo, and vouchers are deposited in the herbarium of the same department (Pirani 4672 and Groppo Jr. 458, respectively). 2.3. Extraction and isolation Ground taproots (3.3 kg), stem (2.5 kg) and leaves (3.2 kg) of H. oreadica, and stem (938 g), stem bark (270 g) and leaves (655 g) of H. brasiliana were extracted 3 times at room temperature using hexane, followed by CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally MeOH. The concentrated dichloromethane extract from H. oreadica (67.6 g) taproots was subjected to column chromatography (CC) over silica gel (70–230 mesh) under vacuum. Elution with hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH yielded 6 fractions. The dichloro- methane fraction was subjected to CC over silica gel (230–400 mesh). Elution with hexane–acetone gradient yielded 13 new fractions. Fraction 2 was ﬂash rechromatographed on silica gel with hexane–EtOAc (19:1), yielding the compound 8 (14.4 mg). Fraction 5 was rechromatographed as above using hexane–acetone (19:1) to yield compound 4 (774.4 mg). Fraction 7 was rechromatographed as above to yield compound 6 (119.6 mg). Fraction 11 was rechromatographed twice as described above (hexane–acetone 19:1, then hexane–CH2Cl2–acetone 16:3:1), affording compound 5 (78.9 mg). Fraction 13 was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel and eluted with hexane–acetone 6:1, yielding 8 new fractions. Fraction 7 was sub- jected to recycling high-performance liquid chromatography (R-HPLC) (MeOH; detection UV l 254 nm, ﬂow rate: 3.0 mL min�1, polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G), and yielded compound 9 (2.3 mg). Fraction 8 was subjected to R-HPLC (MeOH:CH2Cl2, 1:1; detection UV l 254 nm, ﬂow rate: 3.0 mL min�1, polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G), yielding compound 7 (23 mg). The concentrated MeOH extract (3.0 g) from H. oreadica stem was partitioned into hexane, EtOAc and MeOH soluble fractions. The 1H NMR (200 MHz) spectra of these fractions showed that the major dihydrocinnamic acids were in the EtOAc soluble fraction, this was subjected to gel permeation column chromatography (Sephadex LH 20, MeOH) affording compounds 7 (5.5 mg) and 2 (3.5 mg). The dichloromethane extract from H. oreadica leaves (2.5 g) was subjected to preparative High Speed Countercurrent Chromatography (HSCCC) equipped with a quadruple multilayer coil of 1.68 mm I.D. polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) tubing and 443 mL, with a total capacity of 320 mL. The b-value varied from 0.50 at the internal terminal to 0.85 at the external terminal and the revolution radius was 10 cm (b ¼ r/R, where r is the distance from the coil to the holder, and R, the revolution radius or the distance between the holder axis and the central shaft). The speed was 800 rpm. The ﬂow rate (3.0 mL min�1) was controlled with an FMI-50 QD-O SSY, BS/BS (Fluid Metering Inc., NY, USA) constant-ﬂow pump. The sample was injected with a P. C. Inc. injection module with a 5.0 mL sample injection loop. First, the coiled column was entirely ﬁlled with the stationary phase ethanol–H2O–MeCN (8:1:1; lower phase). The apparatus was then rotated forward at 800 rpm, while the mobile phase hexane (upper phase) was pumped into the column in a tail to head (T / H) direction at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL min�1. After the mobile phase front emerged and hydrodynamic equilibrium was established in the column, 5.0 mL of the sample solution containing 2.5 g of the crude extract was injected through the injection module at a ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL min�1. The sample (2.5 g) was dissolved in the stationary phase. A total of 34 fractions of 10 mL each were obtained with an automated fraction collector (Eyela, DC-1200). The collected fractions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and grouped into 8 fractions. Fraction 5 afforded 4 (14.8 mg). The hexane and dichloromethane extracts from the stem of H. brasiliana were combined into a single one on the basis of analytical TLC (4.5 g), which was subjected to CC over silica gel (70–230 mesh) under vacuum. Elution with hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH afforded 9 fractions. Fraction 6 was ﬂash rechromatographed twice on silica gel and eluted with dichloromethane–acetone 9:1, hexane–EtOAc 3:1, respectively, and then by preparative TLC (silica gel; hexane–acetone 7:3), yielding compound 1 (2.9 mg). Fraction 7 was ﬂash rechromatographed on silica gel, eluted with hexane–acetone 9:1, and then by preparative TLC (silica gel; hexane–acetone 8:2), to yield compound 2 (3.1 mg). The hexane and dichloromethane extracts from the stem bark of H. brasiliana were also combined into a single extract on the basis of analytical TLC (2.1 g), which was subjected to CC over silica gel (70–230 mesh) under vacuum. Elution with P.A.C. Braga et al. / Biochemical Systematics and Ecology 43 (2012) 142–151 143 hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH afforded 8 fractions. Fraction 7 was ﬂash rechromatographed on silica gel, eluted with hexane–EtOAc (20:5) and then by preparative TLC (silica gel; hexane–acetone 7:3), to render compound 3 (3.6 mg). The dichloromethane extract of H. brasiliana leaves (3.0 g) was subjected to CC over silica gel (230–400 mesh). Elution with hexane–MeOH gradient yielded 20 fractions. Fractions 10–14 were combined into a single fraction and rechromatographed by preparative TLC (silica gel; hexane–EtOAc 8:2), affording compound 5 (9.8 mg). Fractions 15–20 were also grouped and rechromatographed on silica gel (230–400 mesh), eluted with hexane–EtOAc 9:1, to give 6 (14.9 mg) and 7 (8.7 mg). 2.3.1. 5-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-8-propanoic acid (1) Amorphous white solid.

Results and discussion The hexane and dichloromethane extracts from the stem and stem bark of H. brasiliana were combined, three new dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives were obtained, 1 and 2 from the stem and 3 from the stem bark (Fig. 1). However, the dichloromethane extract from H. oreadica taproots yielded only the known dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives methyl 5,7- dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (4), 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (5), methyl 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoate (6), 5,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1- benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (7), methyl 5-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-pronanoate (8), and 5-methoxy- 2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (9). The ethylacetate-soluble fraction of the methanol extract from H. oreadica stem afforded 2 and 7. The dichloromethane extract from H. brasiliana leaves afforded 5, 6 and 7; and the same extract from H. oreadica leaves afforded 4.

Derivatives 6 and 7 have been isolated only from H. colombiana (Suarez et al., 2002) and 8 from H. badinii (Correa et al., 1975, 1979), Hortia regia (Tinto et al., 1992) and H. colombiana (Suarez et al., 2002), while the acid 9 has been isolated only from the two latter species (Tinto et al., 1992; Suarez et al., 2002). The HSQC and HMBC experiments on 4 allowed for minor corrections to previous 13C NMR assignments (Suarez et al., 2002), and the signals for C-5 and C-8a (Table 2) were reassigned, exchanging one for the other. Compounds 1–3 showed NMR data (Tables 1 and 2) characteristics of dihydrocinnamic acids. Derivative 1 showed features of a chromene ring at d 6.63 (1H, d, J 10.0 Hz), 5.54 (1H, d, J 10.0 Hz) and d 1.41 (6H, s) corresponding to vinyl protons and a pair of magnetically equivalent methyl groups, respectively (Table 1). The 1H NMR spectrum also provided signals for one methoxyl group at d 3.86 (3H, s), two methylene protons coupled to each other at d 2.63 (2H, t, J 7.8 Hz) and 2.84 (2H, t, J 7.8 Hz), and two doublets at d 6.32 (1H, d, J 8.4 Hz) and 6.92 (1H, d, J 8.4 Hz), clearly indicating the aromatic ring to be o,m,p- Table 2 13C NMR chemical shifts for 1–9.

From the HMBC experiments, the correlation observed between the 1H signal at d 6.92, assigned to H-7, and the 13C signal at d 25.0, which showed a one-bond correlation with the 1H signal at d 2.84 (CH2), indicated the presence of a methylene substituent at C-8. The correlation observed between the two signals at d 2.63 (CH2) and 2.84 (CH2) with the 13C signal at d 177.5 conﬁrmed the existence of a propanoic acid unit attached to the aromatic ring at C-8. The methoxyl signal at d 3.86 showed cross peaks with the 13C signal at d 154.0, while the oleﬁnic signal of the chromene ring at d 6.63 showed a correlation with the 13C signal at d 151.3. The methylene signal at d 2.84 exhibited cross peaks with the 13C signal at d 151.3, suggesting that the chromene ring was located between C-5a and O-8a. Moreover, the 1H signal at d 6.92 assigned to H-7 was coupled to the 1H signal at d 6.32 and both signals also showed cross peaks with the 13C signal at d 154.0, thus indicating the methoxyl group to be located at C-5 and allowing for the assignment of the signal at d 6.32 to H-6. The new compound was therefore identiﬁed as 5-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-8-propanoic acid (1). Compound 2 exhibited similar NMR spectra to 1 (Tables 1 and 2), except for the absence of the signal for ortho-related aromatic protons and the presence of a singlet at d 6.60 (1H). Elemental analysis and EIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C16H20O5, requiring the presence of additional oxygen and carbon in comparison with 1. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) showed signals for two methoxyl groups at d 56.5 and 61.3. The methoxyl group ortho-disubstituted at d 61.3 showed a one- bond correlation with the 1H signal at d 3.81 and the latter cross peaks with the 13C signal at d 143.4. The methylene signal at d 2.84 exhibited cross peaks with the 13C signal at d 144.5 and not with 143.4, indicating the chromene ring between C-5a and O-8a and enabling the assignment of the signal at d 144.5 to C-8a. This implies that the methoxyls were located at C-5 (d 61.3) and C-6 (d 56.5) and determined the position of the unsubstituted methine at C-7 (d 6.60). From the HMBC experiments, the correlation observed between the 1H signal at d 6.60 and the 13C signals at d 25.0,143.4 and 146.0 led to their assignment as H- 7, C-30, C-5 and C-6, thus conﬁrming that the unsubstituted carbon must be vicinal to C-8. Thus, the structure of the new natural product is 5,6-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-8-propanoic acid (2). Compound 3 showed spectral characteristics close to those of 1. The principal change observed in the 1H and 13C NMR was the replacement of the resonance for a chromene ring by signals for an oxygenated prenyl and acetonide groups. In the IUPAC name for compound 3, the numbering for heterocyclic acetonide begins with the heteroatom; hence, the numbering of this ring is 1,2,3,4- (see structure of 3). The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1), in addition to signals typical of 1, revealed four methyl singlets at d 1.48, 1.45, 1.25 and 1.21, and two oxymethine protons at d 4.14 (1H, d, J 6.5 Hz) and 5.32 (1H, d, J 6.5 Hz), which were coupled to each other. The hydroxyl groups must be connected at C-10’ and C-20’ of the prenyl unit, in view of the correlation observed between the two methyl singlets at d 1.21 and 1.48 and the 13C signals at d 75.9 and 78.0. The two oxymethine protons at d 4.14 and 5.32 showed a one-bond correlation with the 13C signals at d 78.0 and 67.9, respectively, enabling the assignment of the signals at d 78.0 to C-100 and d 67.9 to C-4, d 4.14 to H-100 and d 5.32 to H-4, since they were coupled to each other. Thus, the 13C signal at d 75.9 was attributed to C-200. Moreover, the 1H signal at d 7.04, assigned to H-7, was coupled to the 1H signal at d 6.41 and both signals also showed cross peaks with the 13C signal at d 157.9, indicating the location of the methoxyl group at C-5 and allowing for the assignment of the signal at d 6.41 to H-6. The correlation observed between the signal at d 4.14, assigned to H-100, and H-6 at d 6.41, with the 13C signal at d 110.5 allowed the latter signal to be attributed to C-5a and indicated that the oxygenated prenyl group was located at C-5a. The methylene signal at d 2.86 and the H-4 signal at d 5.32 exhibited cross peaks with the 13C signal at d 151.3, suggesting that C-8a is oxygenated. The other two methyl singlets at d 1.45 and 1.25 and the H-4 signal at d 5.32 showed correlations with the 13C signal at d 109.4, determining the position of the acetonide group between C-4 and C-8a-O, since this was the only location left in the aromatic ring. Compound 3 was presumed to have an erythro conﬁguration based on the large coupling constant of the H-4 to H-100 (d, J 6.5 Hz) and its comparison with those of synthetic threo-7-O-benzyl-8-(1,2,3-trihydroxy-3-methylbutyl)coumarin 10 (H-10, d 5.69, d, J 2.4 Hz; H-20, d 3.54, d, J 2.4 Hz; Fig. 2) (Reisch and Voerste, 1994). The 1H NMR data of 10 suggest a signiﬁcant contribution from rotamer 10a, where the C–H bonds are gauche on the basis of the small 3JH-10/H-20 value at 2.4 Hz. This rotamer has the C–O/C–OH bonds opposite to each other and appear to be more stable in CDCl3 solution. Compound 3 can be derived from threo- or erythro-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3-(1,2,3-trihydroxy-3-methylbutyl)benzenepropanoic acid (Fig. 2). However, only the erythro isomer shows conformance with the C–O/C–OH and H-4/H-100 bonds opposite each other, and appears to be stably dominated in CDCl3 solution, based on the large 3JH-4/H-100 value at 6.5 Hz. Therefore, compound 3 was called erythro-5-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-4-(1,2-dihydroxy-2-methylpropyl)-4H-1,3- benzodioxin-8-propanoic acid (3). However, compound 3 was puriﬁed by preparative TLC over silica gel and eluted with hexane–acetone 7:3, hence, 3 may not be a genuine natural product. Therefore, the new natural product appears to be erythro-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3-(1,2,3-trihydroxy-3-methylbutyl)benzenepropanoic acid (3a). A review of dihydrocinnamic acids in the Rutaceae shows that the major source of dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives with prenyl or pyrano substituents is various species of Hortia (Fig. 3, Table 3). Thus, the range of dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives in H. brasiliana and H. oreadica indicates that they are related to other species of Hortia. Gleason (1933) described H. colombiana and stated that it is similar to H. brasiliana. According to Groppo (2004), H. colombiana and H. brasiliana represent the same species. H. badinii M.A. Lisboa was used to designate individuals of Hortia, but this error was recently corrected by Groppo et al. (2005), who recognized it as H. brasiliana. However, H. colombiana and H. badinii are cited in Table 3 as they appear in the original literature. Two linear pyrano dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives (16, Fig. 4; Table 3) were found in Adiscanthus fusciﬂorus Ducke (Vieira et al., 1980). It is interesting to note that Groppo et al. (2008), in an analysis of sequence data from two noncoding regions of the chloroplast genome – rps 16 intron and trnL-trnF from 65 species of 59 genera representing all the subfamilies and tribes of Rutaceae, suggested that Adiscanthus and Hortia formed a very strong clade in all their analyses. Because of its baccate fruit and syncarpous ovary, Engler (1931) included Hortia as the single Neotropical genus P.A.C.

Despite the differences in fruit and in the connation of carpels, Hortia and Adiscanthus share simple leaves; free, valvate, and adaxially pilose petals; sparsely branched habit; quinolin-2(1H)-ones and furoquinoline alkaloids; and furocoumarins (Vieira et al., 1980; Napolitano et al., 2003).

Wilson, Philotheca scabra (Paxton) ssp. latifólia P.G Wilson species of Rutoideae, tribe Boronieae, also produce typically dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives (Sultana et al., 2003; Table 3; Fig. 4). Wilson’s classiﬁcation (1998a, b) recognizes two distinct lineages as worthy of separation at the genus level. One lineage comprises only Eriostemon australasius and Eriostemon banksii, while the other one includes the remaining species traditionally placed in Eriostemon, as well as members of Philotheca. The group that includes E. australasius (the type species for Eriostemon) must retain the name Eriostemon, and the other group must take the name Philotheca. Nevertheless, Eriostemon species are cited in Table 3 as they appear in the original literature. The Aurantioideae represented by two species Micromelum falcatum (Lour.) and Micromelum minutum (G. Forst.) Wight & Arn. yielded specialized dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives, which are typically 3,4-dihydro-1,2-secocoumarins (21 and 22, Fig. 4; Table 3). The Flindersioideae is a smaller sub-family of two genera and only Flindersia R.Br. has been reported to contain dihy- drocinnamyl alcohol derivatives (25 and 26, Fig. 4; Table 3). Three types of hemiterpenoid dihydrocinnamic acids were found in rutaceous specieis, using the numbering as shown in Fig. 3, they are 2,4-dioxygenate, 2,4,5- and 2,4,6-trioxygenated. Until recently in Hortia species they are 2,4-dioxygenate-3- prenylated, 2,4,5-trioxygenated-3-prenylated and 2,4,6-trioxygenated-3-prenylated, while Adiscanthus appears to produce only the last type, and Micromelum the ﬁrst one and 2,4-dioxygenate-5-prenylated. The derivatives 2,4,6-trioxygenated-3,5- diprenylated occur in the Australian genera classiﬁed as Rutoideae, tribe Boronieae. Of the dihydrocinnamyl alcohol deriv- atives both 4-hydroxylated and 4-O-prenylated were found in Zanthoxylum and Flindersia, and 4-hydroxylated-3-prenylated only in the ﬁrst genus.

Dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives isolated from Rutaceae genera. P.A.C. Braga et al. / Biochemical Systematics and Ecology 43 (2012) 142–151 149 As pointed above, the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives proved to have special taxonomic interest. The numerous simi- larities between the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives from Hortia species (Toddalioideae) and Rutoideae species clearly indicate the phytochemical afﬁnities of the former with the latter sub-family, as suggested by da Silva et al. (1988) based on different classes of compounds and by Groppo et al. (2008) on cpDNA data. However, Hortia species produce highly specialized limonoids (Jacobs and Ramdayal, 1986; Suárez et al., 1998, 2002) similar to those from Flindersia (Flindersioideae, Rutaceae; Breen et al., 1984), Meliaceae and Cneoraceae families (A,B-seco-limonoids) (da Silva et al., 1987). Indeed the placement of Flindersioideae in the Meliaceae has been advocate, but the presence of rutaceous coumarins and anthranilic acid-derived alkaloids reinforce its position in the Rutaceae. Finally, the systematic signiﬁcance of the dihydrocinnamic acid and dihydrocinnamyl alcohol derivatives was not robust to clarify the classiﬁcation of the genus Hortia, since the limonoids are absent from all genera of Table 3, except in Hotia and Flindersia. Molecular phylogenetic studies are now being utilized increasingly to provide additional characters to clarify genera of uncertain taxonomic placement in the Rutaceae (Chase et al., 1999; Scott et al., 2000; Samuel et al., 2001; Araújo et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2007; Groppo et al., 2008; But et al., 2009). Scott et al. (2000), Poon et al. (2007) and Groppo et al. (2008) described the molecular phylogenetic relationships in Rutoideae and Toddalioideae, however only the latter analyzed Hortia genus. Scott et al. (2000) used DNA sequencing to construct two molecular phylogenies at the intra-family and intrageneric level within the Rutaceae, and the data indicated the inclusion of Flindersioideae within the Rutoideae. A unanimous conclusion from these works on molecular phylogenetic studies is the necessity to merge Rutoideae and Toddalioideae into a single sub-family as predicated by Waterman (1983, 1990, 2007) with morphological and chemical (alkaloids, coumarins and limonoids) parameters. According to DNA and secondary metabolite data Hortia genus should be placed in the intersection of Rutoideae and Toddalioideae, similar in the Waterman (1983, 2007) phylogenetic diagram for Rutaceae. Except for 7, all the dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives isolated from H. brasiliana and H. oreadica were evaluated for their in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesienses, as previously described (Santos et al., 2009). An assay with KB cells was developed to compare the in vitro toxicity of dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives with their selective action on the parasites, as previously described (Santos et al., 2009). The dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives 1–9 showed no appreciable activity against P. falciparum and T. brucei rhodesienses, and none of the compounds were toxic to KB cells (IC50 > 100 mM).
