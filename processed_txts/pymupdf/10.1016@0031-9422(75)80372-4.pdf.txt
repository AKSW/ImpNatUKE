Samp. extracts. C. clausseni contains additionally  (3R)-  mucroquinone  (7-hydroxy-8,4’-dimethoxyisoflavanquinone),  (3R)-vestitol (7,2’-dihydroxy-4’-methoxy-  isoflavan),  (3R)-cc,a-dimethylallylcyclolobin  [IS’-(1,l -dimethylallyl)-7,3’,4’-trihydroxy-Y-methoxyisofla-  van], biscyclolobin, 3’-hydroxyformononetin  and isoliquiritigenin. The structural proposals for vestitol  and claussequinone  were confirmed by synthesis.  Dalbergia,  Machaerium  and Cyclolobium  (Legu-  minosae-Lotoideae)  are morphologically  closely  related [3]. Previous work on 25 Dalbergiu  and  Machaerium  species has shown that the affinities  of the two genera extend to their chemical com-  position [4]. Only a few Cyclolobium  species are  known, all of very restricted geographical  distri-  bution; C. clausseni Benth., trivial name sucupira  carim, and C. vecchii A. Samp. occur in the State  of Minas Gerais.  The benzene extracts of the trunk wood of both  species contain  an orange pigment (la), which  gave a monoacetate  (lb) and was named clausse-  quinone after it was found that the compound  is amenable to reduction to a quinol which, upon  ‘acetylation, gives a triacetate (2a).

Application  of the orthoformate  method  [7] to this deoxybenzoin  led to  7-hydroxy-  2’,4’-dimethoxyisoflavone  (3a) [S],  which  was  selectively  demethylated  by  AlCl,  in  C,HsN02  [9] to 7,2’-dihydroxy-4’-methoxyisofla-  vone (3b) [S]. The catalytic reduction  of isofla-  vans is not uniformly successful [lo] and it was  deemed  necessary  to test its applicability  on  several common isoflavones @c-f). In these model  reactions the hitherto undescribed  (+)-7,3’,4’-tri-  methoxy- (2b), (+ )-7-hydroxy-6,4’-dimethoxy-  (2~)  and (+ )-7-hydroxy-4’-methoxy-  (2d) isoflavans  were prepared. Finally also the reduction of 7,2’-  dihydroxy-4’-methoxyisoflavone  was attempted,  leading without difficulty to (f )-7,2’-dihydroxy-  4’-methoxyisoflavan  (2e) whose oxidation  with  Fremy’s salt gave a compound,  identical in all  2495  2496  0. R. G~TTLEB et al  respects with natural claussequinone  (la), except  for mp and optical activity. The synthetic material  was, of course, inactive, while natural clausse-  quinone  showed a positive Cotton  effect. (3S)-  Claussequinone  (la). obtained  by CrO,/AcOH  oxidation of (+)-7,2’-dihydroxy-4’-methoxyisofla-  van, the (3S)-vestitol (2e) of D. mriahilis  Vog. [ 1 l]  D. cmstoplzylluttz (L.) Taub. [ 121 and M. wstitutn  Vog, [ll].  showed a negative Cotton effect [13].  The (3R)-configuration  must, consequently, corre-  spond to the claussequinone  (la) from CJK&~O-  hiutn.  From the heartwood  extract  of C. duussetzi,  available in comparatively  much larger quantity,  an additional  pigment  was isolated. This was  recognised as (3R)-mucroquinone  (lc) by spectral  data  and direct comparison  with (3S)-mucro-  quinone  ex  M.  tnucromdatutn  Mart. [I 1, 131.  Again, only the antipodal  ORD curves of both  derivatives were not coincident.  A priori, it would seem reasonable  to consider  la and lc artifacts. produced  by oxidation  re-  spectively of 2e and 2f. Although at least one of  the required precursors. namely (3R)-vestitol (2e),  was isolated from the C. c~lausseni extract. the  presence of yellow pigments is consistent with the  bright colour of the wood samples. (3K)-Vestitol  was identified by comparison  with the synthetic  (t)-7,2’-dihydr  oxy-4’-methoxyisoflavan  (2e), de-  scribed above, as well as with natural (3S)-vestitol,  differing from these products  in the appropriate  manner only with respect to the ORD curves.  Two  additional  isoflavan  derivatives  were  obtained from the same source. They were char-  acterized as such through inspection of their IR  and UV spectra. The PMR spectrum of 4 con-  firmed this proposal  through  the characteristic  signals due to the 5 protons  of the heterocycle  and revealed substitution  by an r,r-dimethylallyl  group. MS evidence shows that this. together with  2 hydroxyls and 1 methoxyl, can only be placed  on ring B (rctro-Diels--Alder  fragment: nl/r 234).  Ring A is monohydroxylated  (retro-Diels-Alder  fragment: ttzic 122) as shown in 4, since a mm  split doublet  is located at the high field PMR  limit (Z 3.63. d J 2.0 Hz) of the 3-proton system  and must thus keep ortho-relations  to two oxi-  functions. The lone aromatic proton of ring B (z  3.39, s) can only be placed pwa (or ortho) mm,  meta to the oxi-functions.  The ortho-alternatives  (5, 6), however, can be safely disregarded.  The  hydroxyls. which form a catechol system (H3B03  UV shift), are highly hindered, derivatization  of  the compound being very difficult, and must both  be vicinal to substituents  as in 4. Furthermore,  the pyridine induced solvent shift [14] of the ring  B aromatic proton signal is very weak. The 3R-  configuration  can be attributed  to x.r-dimethyIaI-  lylcyclolobin  (4) upon comparison  of its ORD  curve with published data [13].  Insolubility in the usual solvents prevented the  measurement  of a reasonable PMR spectrum for  the additional  isoflavan.  The  MS,  however,  showed that this must be a dehydrative  dimer  based on cyclolobin such as 7. The molecular ion  suffers two consecutive losses of ring-A fragments  leading to IIn/r-122]+’ and [M-244]+. ions.  The biosynthesis of isoflavan derivatives should  involve pterocarpan,  isoflavone and chalcone in-  termediates [4], and the two latter classes are in-  deed represented  in C. claus.wtzi through  7,3’-  dihydroxy-4’-methoxyisoflavone  (3g) and  isoli-  quiritigenin. The chalcone was previously isolated  from Dalhergia  and Machuwiuttt  species [ 131 and  identified by direct comparison with an authentic  Isoflavonoids from Cyclolobium  species  2491  sample. The isoflavone  (3g) gave a diacetate,  which contributed  to the spectral determination  of its structure,  and the known dimethyl ether  (cabreuvin, 3c) [lS], identified by direct compari-  son with an authentic  sample. 3’-Hydroxyfor-  mononetin (3g) was isolated previously from Pter-  ocarpus  dalbergioides  [16] and subsequently  also  from Machaerium  vestitum Vog., Myroxylon  perui-  ferum L.f. and M. balsamum (L.) Harms [17].  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation  of the constituents  of Cyclolobium clausseni. The  trunk wood of a specimen collkcteh in the vicinity of Pedro  Leopoldo, Minas Gerais, and identified bv the botanist A.  Pereira Duarte, was separated into bark, heartwood and soft-  wood. The ground heartwood (3.4 kg) was extracted succes-  sively with C,H, and EtOH. The C&H, extract C 160 !zj was  ”  ”  \  “I  extracted exh&&vely  with hot petrol (bp 60-80”). Chromat-  ography on silica (I.4 kg) of the petrol insoluble portion (140 g)  gave three main fractions with the indicated  eluants: Al  (C,H,-CHCl,,  1: l), A, (CHCl,) and A? (CHCl,-MeOH,  19: 1). A, (5.5 g) was chromatographed  on silica (1OGg). Crys:  tallization of the C6H,-CHC13 (19: 1) eluate from MeOH gave  sitosterol (60 mg), while crystallization  of the C,H,-CHCl,  (1:3) eluate from MeOH afforded (3R)-la (600 mg). Crystalli-  zation of A2 (51.0 g) from MeOH gave (3R)-la (600 mg). Crv-  stallization of A2 (51.0 g) from MeOH gave (3R):la (4.0-i). Tie  filtered MeOH soln was evaporated and residue (47,Og) was  chromatographed  on silica (500 g) yielding the following useful  fractions with the indicated solvents: B, (CsH,-CHC13,  1: l),  Bz, B3 (C,H,-CHCl+  1:3), B, (CHCI,), B, (CHCl,-MeOH,  19: 1). Crystallization  of B, (6.3 g) from MeOH gave (3R)-la  (260 mg). The filtered MeOH soln was evaporated and the  residue (6.0 g) was chromatographed  on silica (120 g) giving  the following useful fractions: C, (C,H,-CHCl,  1:3) and CZ  (CHCI,). Crystallization  of C, from MeOH gave (3R)-la  (104 mg). CZ (1% g) was chromatographed  twice on Sephadex  LH-20 (MeOH) giving (3R)-2e (241 mg). B2 (11.0 g) was chro-  matographed on silica (400g). Crystallization of the CHC13-  MeOH 19: 1 eluate from EtOH gave 3g (202 mg). The mother  liquor was evaporated and residue (I.8 g) chromatographed  on Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH). Intermediate fractions were re-  crystallized from EtOH giving 3g (166 mg) and the later frac-  tions yielded, after preparative TLC, isoliquiritigenin (10 mg).  Crystallization  of B, (11.2g) from MeOH  gave (3R)-la  (540 mg). The filtered MeOH soln was evaporated and residue  (107g) was chromatographed  on silica (200~). The CHCl,  eluate (4.6g) was cryitailized  from MeOH giving  (3R)-1;  (138 mg). Filtered MeOH soln was evaoorated  and residue  (4.5 g) was chromatographed  on Sephahex LH-20 (MeOH)  yielding (3R)-lc (60 mg). B4 (8.3 g) was chromatographed  2 x  on Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) giving 4 (790 mg). Crystallization  of B, (1.8 g) from MeOH gave 7 (17 mg). A, (4.6 g) was chro-  matographed  on silica (1OOg). Crystallization  of the CsH,-  CHC13 1: 1 eluate from EtOH yielded (3R)-la (88 mg).  Isokztion of’the constituents ofC. vecchii. The ground heart-  wood (15 g) of a sample from the wood collection of the Rio  de Janeiro Botanical Garden, supplied by the botanist A. de  Mattos F”., was extracted successively with C,Hs and EtOH.  The C,H, ext. (1.2 g) was washed exhaustively with hot petrol  (bp 6&80”). The residue was crystallized from MeOH giving  (3R)-la (8 mg).
