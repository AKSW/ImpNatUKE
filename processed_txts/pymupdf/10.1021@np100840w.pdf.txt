The clerodanes are a group of diterpenoids with interesting biological eﬀects such as antifungal,14 antileish- manial and antiplasmodial,15 antimalarial and antimycobac- terial,16 antitumor,17,18cytotoxic,1,14,16,19-31immunomodulatory,32 and trypanocidal activities.33 In our continuing investigation of the bioactive clerodane diterpenes from Casearia species, we undertook the ﬁrst phytochemical investigation of Casearia rupestris Eichler. This shrub or small tree grows up to 6.0 m in height and is found in Brazil (Mato Grosso and Minas Gerais States) and Bolivia (Sta. Cruz State) in the Cerrado, grasslands, and sometimes pastures, at altitudes of 350-500 m.34 Investiga- tion of the cytotoxic Et2O fraction yielded four new clerodane diterpenes (1-4) (Figure 1). Compounds 1 and 4 were acety- lated, resulting in two new derivatives (5, 6) (Figure 1). The cytotoxic activity of the diterpenes (1-6) against a panel of human cancer cell lines (HL-60, MDA/MB-435, HCT-8, and SF-295) has been evaluated. ’RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Investigation of the Et2O phase of the EtOH extract of the leaves of C. rupestris led to the isolation of four new clerodane diterpenoids, casearupestrins A-D (1-4). 2,7-Di-O-acetylca- searupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6) were obtained by acetylation of compounds 1 and 4, respectively. The structures (Figure 1) of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and spectrometric data (IR, UV, NMR, and MS) and by comparison with NMR data of reported compounds.6 Casearupestrin A (1) was obtained as a white, amorphous solid ([R]24 D þ4.3 (c 1.0, MeOH)). The molecular formula Received: November 17, 2010 ABSTRACT: Four new clerodane diterpenes, casearupestrins A-D (1-4), were isolated from the leaves of Casearia rupestris. Compounds 1 and 4 were acetylated to yield 2,7-di-O-acetylca- searupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearupestrin D (6). All compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Casearupestrin A (1) exhibited the most potent activity against MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma) and SF-295 (human glioblastoma) cells, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin. 777 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J. Nat. Prod. 2011, 74, 776–781 Journal of Natural Products ARTICLE C34H48O9 was determined by HRESIMS, based on the sodiated ion peak at m/z 623.3190 [M þ Na]þ (calcd 623.3190), which implies 11 degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed the presence of carbonyl esters (1746 and 1712 cm-1). The UV spectrum displayed absorptions at λmax 223 nm (log ε 1.40) and 268 nm (log ε 1.50), corresponding to diene and dienone chromophores, respectively. The 13C and DEPT 135� NMR data showed the presence of 34 carbons divided into seven quaternary (including three carbonyl carbons), 13 methine, nine methylene, and ﬁve methyl carbons. The oleﬁnic region of the 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) revealed proton signals with characteristic cis/trans coupling at δH 5.06 (1H, d, J = 10.5 Hz, H-15), 5.30 (1H, d, J = 17.5 Hz, H-15), and 6.47 (1H, dd, J = 10.5, 17.5 Hz, H-14), indicating a terminal monosubstituted oleﬁnic moiety. Another terminal methylene, identiﬁed by two singlets at δH 4.94 and 5.03 (2H, H-16), was connected to a quaternary carbon (C-13). An additional oleﬁnic doublet was observed at δH 6.04 (1H, d, J = 4.0 Hz, H-3) and correlated to a methine carbon at δC 128.6 (C-3) in the gHMQC spectrum. Two deshielded acetal protons were observed at δH 6.35 (1H, t, J = 1.5 Hz, H-18) and 6.49 (1H, s, H-19), which correlated to methine signals at δC 96.3 and 99.8, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum also revealed the presence of two methyl groups at δH 1.06 (1H, brd, J = 4.0 Hz, H-17) and 1.07 (1H, s, H-20) and three oxymethines at δH 4.45 (1H, brt, J = 4.0 Hz, H-2), 5.18 (1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz, H-6), and 3.66 (1H, t, J = 10.0 Hz, H-7). The spectroscopic data of 1 (Tables 1 and 2) are in accord with the basic skeleton of clerodane diterpenoids previously isolated from Casearia species.10,18,35 The acyclic moiety at C-9, including the diene group, was deduced from the correlations of H-12 with C-11, H-14 with C-13 and C-16, H-15 with C-13 and C-14, and H-16 with C-14 (Figure 2). The position of the hydroxy group at C-7 was deduced by the long-range correlation of the oxy- methine signal at δH 3.66 (H-7) with δC 77.5 (C-6), 44.8 (C-8), and 11.7 (C-17) (Figure 2). A decadienoate moiety, identiﬁed by gHMBC and gCOSY correlations (Figure 2), was characterized by a Z- (δH 5.68, J = 11.5 Hz; 6.69, J = 11.5 Hz) and an E-double bond (δH 7.37, J = 14.0, 11.5 Hz; 6.16, J = 14.0, 7.0 Hz) and a triplet methyl (δH 0.98, J = 7.0 Hz). This same 2Z,4E-decadienoate unit has been veriﬁed in other clerodane diterpenes isolated from C. pitumba and C. arguta.6,36 Its position was determined at C-6 (δC 77.5), on the basis of the long-range correlation observed in the gHMBC spectrum between the oxymethine proton (H-6) and the carbonyl carbon (δC 167.3, C-10). Finally, since H-19 (δC 6.49) was correlated with the carbonyl group (δC 171.4) of one acetate unit, the second acetate unit (δC 171.8 and 21.0) must be located at C-18 (Figure 2). The relative conﬁguration of 1 was determined by using coupling constants, 1D-NOE data, and 13C NMR chemical shifts (Table 1 and Figure 3). The trans conﬁguration between the C-17 and C-20 methyl groups was shown by the chemical shift at δC 26.4 for C-20, which also supported a cis-A/B ring junction.3,5,10 The J values of 3.5 and 13.5 Hz for the coupling of H-10 and H-1 revealed that H-10 (rel-R) is in the axial position. The NOE enhancement between H-19 and H-10, and H-19 and H-7, indicated the same R-orientation to H-19 and H-7 (Figure 2). The large coupling constant between H-6 (δH 5.18 - 1H, d, J = 10.0 Hz) and H-7 (δH 3.66 - 1H, t, J = 10.0 Hz) supported their 1,2-diaxial relationship. The NOE interaction between H-6 (rel-β) and H-8 implied that H-8 and Me-17 were at axial and equatorial positions, respectively. A small coupling constant of 4.0 Hz for H-2/H-1 suggested an equatorial orientation for H-2 (rel-β), which was conﬁrmed by the broad triplet at δH 4.45 and the chemical shift of C-2 at δC 64.2. From the allylic coupling between H-3 and H-18 (J = 1.5 Hz) and NOE enhancement observed between H-18 and H-6 it can be deduced that H-18 also has a β-orientation. Therefore, casearupestrun A (1), a new clerodane diterpenoid, was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,- 8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-18,19-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-6-[(20Z,40E)- decadienoyloxy]-2,7-dihydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. The MS, UV, and IR data and the speciﬁc rotation value of casearupestrin B (2) were comparable with those of 1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Tables 1 and 2) revealed the same substituents and substitution patterns. However, changes in the chemical shift values related to H-6 (δH 3.75 - 1H, d, J = 10.5 Hz) and H-7 (δH 5.15 - 1H, t, J = 10.5 Hz) required placement of the decadienoate ester at C-7. The structure 2 was corroborated by the same correlations observed for 1 in the gHMQC, gHMBC, andgCOSY (Figure 2). The observed NOESY interactions and coupling constants for casearupestrin B (2) indicate the samerelative conﬁguration as 1 (Figure 3 andTable 1). Hence, casearupestrin B (2) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R, 9R,10S,18R,19R)-18,19-diacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7-[(20Z,40E)- decadienoyloxy]-2,6-dihydroxyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. The structures of the remaining two compounds can be ration- alized by comparison with the previous ones. Analysis of the NMR data of compound 3 revealed a strong similarity to com- pounds 1 and 2. However, the molecular formula C33H48O8, determined by the HRESIMS, revealed a sodiated ion peak at m/ z 595.3241 [M þ Na]þ, which implied 10 degrees of unsaturation. The main diﬀerence observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 3 in relation to compounds 1 and 2 (Tables 1 and 2) was the presence of signals at δH 3.36 (1H, s) and δC 55.4. These signals indicated that an acetoxy group at C-18 was replaced by a methoxy group, which was conﬁrmed by the gHMBC correlation between H-18 and the methoxy group. The relative conﬁguration of 3 was identical to 1 on the basis of the same NOESY interac- tions (Figure 3) and coupling constants. Thus, casearupestrin C (3) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-19-acetoxy-18, Figure 1. Structure of the clerodane diterpenes from Casearia rupestris. 778 dx.doi.org/10.1021/np100840w |J. Nat.

Compound 4 had the molecular formula C36H50O10, deter- mined by HRESIMS (observed m/z 665.3297 [M þ Na]þ). The 1H and 13C NMR data of 4 (casearupestrin D) (Tables 1 and 2) were similar to those of 2 except for replacement of a hydroxy group at C-6 by an acetoxy group [δH 1.95 (3H, s), δC 171.5, δC 20.9]. The 1H and 13C NMR assignments of compound 4 were conﬁrmed by 2D NMR correlations, and its conﬁguration was established by the sign of the speciﬁc rotation, NOESY interac- tions, and coupling constants (Figure 3). Thus, casearupestrin D (4) was assigned as rel-(2R,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S,18R,19R)-6,18, 19-triacetoxy-18,19-epoxy-7-[(20Z,40E)-decadienoyloxy]-2-hydro- xyclero-3,13(16),14-triene. Acetylation of 1 and 4 with Ac2O-pyridine yielded two new clerodane diterpenes derivatives, 5 and 6, respectively (Tables 1 and 2, NMR data). The products were named 2,7- di-O-acetylcasearupestrin A (5) and 2,6-di-O-acetylcasearu- pestrin D (6). Theresultsofthebiologicaltestsofcompounds1-6areshownin Table 3. Casearupestrins A (1), B (2), and D (4) showed signiﬁcant cytotoxicity against four cell lines (HL-60, HCT-8, MDA/MB-435, and SF-295), with IC50 values ranging from 0.10 to 1.3 μM. Com- pound 1 had an IC50 value of 0.36 μM against MDA/MB-435 and SF-295 cancer cell lines, superior to that of the standard drug doxorubicin (Table 3). Acetylation of compounds 1 and 4 resulted in decreased cytotoxicity (Table 3), indicating that the C-2 OH group is essential for the cytotoxicity of these compounds. ’EXPERIMENTAL SECTION General Experimental Procedures.

Positive-ion HRMS spectra were recorded on an UltrOTOFq (Bruker Daltonics) ESI-qTOF mass spectrometer, using TFANa as the internal standard. Analytical HPLC was per- formed on a Varian Pro Star 230 with UV-vis detector (model 330), using a Phenomenex C18 column (250 mm � 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Open column chromatography was performed over silica gel (40-63 μm, Merck) or silica C18 (40 μm, J. T. Baker) or on Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). TLC was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (>230 mesh) and precoated silica gel 60 PF254 plates. Spots on TLC plates were observed under UV light and by spraying the plates with anisaldehyde-H2SO4 reagent, followed by heating at 120 �C. Plant Material. Casearia rupestris leaves were collected in May 2007 in Campinas municipality, S~ao Paulo State, Brazil. The plant material was identified by one of the authors (R.B.T.). A voucher specimen (IAC41542) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Instituto Agron^omico de Campinas (S~ao Paulo State). Extraction, Isolation, and Chemical Transformation. The dried and ground leaves (0.46 kg) were exhaustively extracted by successive maceration with hexanes, EtOH, and H2O (3.0 L � 3) at room temperature. The EtOH extract was concentrated under reduced pressure at 40 �C to yield 30.0 g of a crude extract. This extract was then diluted with MeOH-H2O (3:1) and successively partitioned with hexanes (1.0 L � 3), Et2O (1.0 L � 3), and EtOAc (1.0 L � 3). After removal of the solvent, each extract yielded 10.8, 3.2, and 1.2 g, respectively.

Cytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxicity of the clerodane diterpenes (1-6) was tested against four tumor cell lines: SF-295 (human glioblas- toma), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma), HL-60 (human leukemia), and MDA/MB-435 (human melanoma). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM gluta- mine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37 �C with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (105 cells/well for adherent cells or 0.3 � 106 cells/well for suspended cells in 100 μL of medium). After 24 h, the compounds (0.39-25 μg/mL) dissolved in DMSO were added to each well. Doxorubicin (0.01-0.58 μg/mL) was used as the positive control. The proliferation of tumor cells was quantified by the ability of living cells to reduce the yellow dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)- 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a blue formazan pro- duct. At the end of 69 h incubation, the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/mL of MTT. Three hours later, the formazan product was dissolved in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter). The IC50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using the GRAPHPAD program (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA).37 ’ASSOCIATED CONTENT b S Supporting Information.
