Even the most sensitive  assay, root extension in lettuce required a psilotin con-  centration of 0*3mM. Levels of this magnitude are not  indicative of a particularly  potent regulator. However,  the reported psilotin contents of O&1*22% (fr. wt) [1,2]  corresponds  to ca 4-37 mmoljkg of tissues hence fall  easily within the range of inhibitory concentrations.  The concept of psilotin as part of a regulatory system  is reinforced by the demonstration  that its inhibitory  effects are reversed by glutathione, other thio-compounds  and gibberellin A3 (Table 2). Glutathione,  thiourea and  thioproline at 1 mM restore nearly full germination  to  seeds near the ID,, level in 5 mM psilotin. Hydroxypro-  line, lacking the reducing group, is inactive, but gibberel-  lin A3 is cz lO-lOO-fold more active than the thiols.  These responses underscore the coumarin-like  character  of psilotin [4&J as well as its potential role in growth  regulation.  EXPERIMENTAL  Test materials used in the survey included seeds of turnip,  Brussica rupa cv Purple Top White Globe; lettuce, Lacruca  sativa cv Iceberg; and onion, Allium cepa cv Yellow Globe.  Seed and seedling tests were carried out in petri dishes on  moist filter paper at 24“ under 500 Ix daylight fluorescent light.  Germination  data are based upon 4-5 replicates each with  75-125 seeds. Growth measurements were based upon tripli-  cates of 35-50 seedlings each. ID,,  values (concentrations  required for M”/, inhibition) were obtained by graphical inter-  polation. Psilotin was provided by Professor G. H. N. Towers,  University of British Columbia.  5.  6.

Elution  with  C,H,--CHCl,  7:3 to 1:l gave an oil from which a com-  pound, C1,H2e04 (UOmg), was isolated by preparative  TLC. This was recognized as a dihydroxy-dimethoxy-1,3-  diarylpropane by its ‘HMR spectrum in which appeared  signals due to a CHa flanked by two ArCH, systems,  two OMe groups and six aromatic protons. One of the  aryls is 3,4dioxygenated,  as evidenced by proton signals  between z 3.15 and 3.35 whose multiplicity can be ana-  lysed in the spectrum of the diacetate. The other one  is 2,4-dioxygenated as shown by a doublet  (7 3.62, J 2  Hz) and a triplet (7 358, J 8 & 2Hz) at the high field,  and a doublet  (7 300, J 8Hz) at the low field sides of  the aromatic region. The signals due to all six aromatic  protons were shifted paramagnetically  upon formation  of the diacetate, reason why one OH, and, consequently,  one OMe, must be located on each of the rings. This  symmetrical distribution  is indicated also by the simpli-  city of the MS, compatible with the formation of frag-  ments of identical mass from either ring.

Its absence locates the  methoxyl at the o-position. Since thus the OH in the  ring under scrutiny must occupy the p-position, a posi-  tive Gibbs test of the compound locates the OH of the  other ring at the m-position, as in la.

INTRODUCTION  Since their discovery by Lester [l] and Morton [Z], ubi-  quinones  have received much attention  from many  workers in various fields of research. In the case of cul-  tured plant cells, Threlfall and Goodwin [3] reported the  occurrence of ubiquinone-10  in Paul’s scarlet rose while  Thomas and Stobart examined the time-course of ubi-  &none  and  a-tbcopherol  formation  in  Kaluncko2  cl’enqa callus [4].  According to our investigations [S], tobacco cells in  suspension culture appear to contain much more ubi-  quinone-10  than the parent plants and so might be a  suitable source for the large scale production of this com-  pound. In order to obtain basic information on the syn-  thesis of ubiquinone-10  by cultured plant cells, some  observations on the variation in the ubiquinone  content  during the growth of the cultured cells have been made  and are detailed in this paper.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The time-course of ubiquinone  formation during cell  growth was examined using three kinds of cultured cells  *Stbdies on the Culture Conditions of Higher Plant Cells  in Suspension Culture.

The clone BY-2 reached a maximum dry weight 6  days after inoculation,  while their ubiquinone  content  decreased during the early period af the logarithmic  phase of growth and then increased reaching the highest  level (36Opg per g-dry weight) on the 10th day (Fig 1).
