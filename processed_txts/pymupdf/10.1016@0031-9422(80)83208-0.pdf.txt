For reasons  stated in the previous paper in this series [1], nomenc-  lature and numbering of neolignans follow the rules  which were outlined in a recent review [4].  la Ar = a-Pi,/3-allyl  lb Ar =/3-Pi, a-allyl  le Ar =/3-Mp, a-allyl  p Me  2  7?

Constitu-  tional differences concern the nature of the aryl groups  with piperonyl (Pi) in 3a, 3b and 3c but 3-methoxy-  4,5-methylenedioxyphenyl (Mp) in 3e and 3f. Config-  urational differences concern orientation of H-4'  further from the plane of the carbonyl in 3a, 3b and 3e  (6 4.15±0.03, J=3Hz) than in 3e and 3f (6 4.45±  0.11, J=5 Hz). This difference in orientation, which  was left undefined in the original report on 3e and 31  [5] was confirmed by antipodal Cotton effects at the  carbonyl absorptions (ca 330 nm) for 3a, 3b and 3e  compared with 3¢, 3f. The Cotton effects for the  benzenoid absorptions (ca 255 nm), however, are iden-  tical for all five compounds, and absolute stereochemi-  cal details known for 3e and 3f [5] can thus be  extended to 3a, 3b and 3¢.  Deduction of these details had involved conversion  of 3e, as well as le of known absolute sterochemistry,  into the guianin-type neolignan 4e [5]. ~I-t NMR  analysis indicated the relationship of the novel 4a,  C18H15Oz'OH(OMe)2,  and  of  4e,  C~8H1402  (OMe)202CH2. Except for the aryl groups, Pi in 4a  and Mp in 4c, the compounds are identical in all  respects, including stereochemistry, as shown by  superimposable ORD curves. In contrast, the neolig-  nan 5 from A. affinis [6], an isomer of 4a, shows an  antipodal Cotton effect at the absorption wavelength  (ca 270 nm) of the enone chromophore.  /•OMe  5  Like 4a (v ....  I764, 1680cm-~), 4b is also a di-  ketone. One of the carbonyls is again on a cyclopentane  ring (U,,ax 1760 cm -~) but the other is not a, /3-  unsaturated (u,,,x 1695 cm-~). Indeed, the compound,  C~sH17Oz-OH(OMe)z, has two additional hydrogens in  its formula and is thus tentatively written 4b. The 60  MHz IH NMR spectrum, although consistent, is not  sufficiently resolved between 6 2.0-3.0 and 4.3-4.7 to  confirm this proposal.  Short Reports  475  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation of the constituents. Trunk wood of an Aniba  species (voucher Herbarium INPA, Manaus, 43254), col-  lected near km 133 of the Manaus-Itacoatiara highway  (Amazonas) was reduced to powder (4.5 kg) and percolated  with EtOH. The solvent was evapd and the residue (65 g)  extracted with C6H 6. The extract (5 g) was chromatographed  on a dry Si gel (280 g) column. Development with C6H 6-  EtOAc (8:2) gave 6 fractions. Fraction 1 (0.9 g) was a fatty  oil. Fraction 2 (0.7 g) gave elemicin, Fraction 3 (0.9 g) was  separated with MeOH into an insoluble steroid and a soluble  mixture. This was separated by TLC (Si gel; petrol-Me2CO,  8:2) into la and 3c. Fractions 4 (0.3 g) and 5 (0.3 g) were  separated by the same TLC procedure respectively into 43 +  4b, 311, 2 and lb, 3b. All products were purified by TLC (Si  gel; C6H6-Et20, 7:3) giving la (8 rag), lb (159 mg), 2 (20  mg), 33 (49 rag), 3b (13 mg), 3e (12 rag, 43 (8 rag), 4b (5  mg).Identifications of the known compounds elemicin, la, lb  and 2 involved direct comparison with authentic samples [2,  3].

INTRODUCTION  Balanophoru  tobirucola  Makino  (Japanese  name  Kiiretsuchitorimochi), one of seven  Balanophoraceous  plants  in Japan,  parasitizes  the terminal  roots  of host  plant such as Pittosporum tobira Ait. and is distributed  from  southern  Japan  to Taiwan  [l].  Several  triter-  penes  and phenylpropanoids  have been reported  pre-  viously  from  B. japonica Makino  [2], B. polyandra  Griff. [3] and B. indica Wall. [4] and several  flavones  from Lophophytum Learn&i Eirchl.  151 and Juelia sub-  terranea [6]. This paper  describes  the phytochemistry  of B. tobiracolu Makino.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Six known  phenylpropanoids:  p-methoxycinnamic  acid,  trans-cinnamic  acid,  caffeic  acid methyl  ester,  p-coumaric  acid,  m-coumaric  acid,  caffeic  acid and  two triterpenes:  @-amyrin acetate  and lupeol were iso-  lated from the ether-soluble  fraction  of the methanol  extract  of the whole  plant  of B. tobirucola Makino.  Dihydrochalcone  1 was also isolated  from  the same  fraction,  while from the ethyl acetate-soluble  fraction  of  the  methanol  extract,  both  1 and  the  related  glucoside  2 were obtained.

From measurements  of IR, MS, ‘H and “C NMR  spectra  of 1 and the corresponding  tri-.  tetra-  and  pentamethyl  ethers  prepared  by  methylation  with  diazomethane  or dimethyl  sulphate,  the structure  of 1  was assumed  to be 3-hydroxyphloretin.  This was con-  firmed  by the direct  comparisons  (IR.  MS and  ‘H.  NMR) with an authentic  sample.  On acid hydrolysis.  2  yielded  3-hydroxyphloretin.  and fi-[,-glucose.  Futher-  more,  the presence  of a @-glucopyranose  moiety  in 2  was shown  by the analysis  of the coupling  constants  of the anomeric  carbon  atoms (C-1”) in the ’ ‘CJ NMR  sprectra  (Table  1,l [7] of 2 and its hepta-  and octaace-  tates.  Consequently.  2 is 3-hydroxyphlorctin  4’-P-D-  glucoside.  and this was confirmed  by comparison  with  an authentic  sample.

Comparative  studies  of the constituents  of the Row-  ers and the rhizomes  of B. tobirucolu Makino,  showed  clear  differences:  i.e.  rrans-cinnamic  acid and caffeic  acid methyl  ester  were  present  in both  parts  of the  plant,  the  main  components  ot  the  flowers  were  glycosides  (80%).  while the rhizomes  contained  60%  of hydrocarbons  and  triterpenes  such  as P-amyrin  acetate  and lupeol,  along with 30”/0 of phcnylpropa-  noids.
