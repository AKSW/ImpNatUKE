(Lamiaceae, formerly Verbenaceae) is a familiar Brazilian species popularly known as Tarum˜a whose leaf tea has been used by population to treat kidney diseases. The aim of this research was to investigate the hydroalcoholic extract of leaves in order to isolate the active compounds. Hydroalcoholic extract of leaves was obtained by stirring the previous hexane and methanol extracted leaves residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing. The obtained extract was partitioned with n-butanol. The yielded fraction was subsequently submitted to several chromatographic procedures to lead to the isolation of O-glycosidicﬂavones orientin and isoorientin as well as C-glycosylﬂavones schaftoside and carlinoside along with their isomers, known as potent anti-inﬂammatory, antinociceptive and antioxidant agents, then identiﬁed as the active constituents, justifying the folk use of the plant to combat and prevent kidney stone and inﬂammation. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

(Lamiaceae, according to Cantino et al., 1992; formerly Verbenaceae, in keeping with Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957) is a widespread and well-known Brazilian species which occurs mainly in the States of Minas Gerais, Esp´ırito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and S˜ao Paulo (Moldenke and Moldenke, 1957). The plant was col- lected in July 2000, in the city of Poc¸os de Caldas, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and authenticated by Dr. F´atima Regina Salimena-Pires, a taxonomic botanist from Universi- dade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF). A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of Faculdade de Filosoﬁa, Ciˆencias e Letras da Universidade de S˜ao Paulo, campus Ribeir˜ao Preto (SPFR), Brazil, under the acquisition number 9968. ∗ Corresponding author.

Use in traditional medicine The leaf tea is used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat and prevent kidney stone and inﬂammation (Rodrigues, 2001). 3. Previously isolated classes of constituents In preceding studies, Vitex polygama has been found to contain sesquiterpenes, fatty acids (Barbosa et al., 1995), 2′′-O- caffeoylorientin besides other common ﬂavones simultaneously with some O-glycosylated derivatives, ﬂavonols, phenolic acids (Leit˜ao and Delle Monache, 1998), several monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the essential oil (Leit˜ao et al., 1999), phy- tosteroids, caffeoylesters from quinic acid (Santos, 2000), and ecdysteroids (Santos et al., 2001). 4. Materials and methods The powder of the air-dried leaves (423.0 g) was extracted successively with hexane and methanol (MeOH) through per- colation process at room temperature. Hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with 50% aqueous MeOH solution by ultra-sonic mixing for 10 min (3× 300 mL). 0378-8741/$ – see front matter © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Chemical structures of compounds isolated from Vitex polygama n-butanolic extract. The resulting ﬁltrates were subsequently combined, evaporated in vacuum (40 ◦C) and lyophilized. Afterward, the extract (31 g, 31%, w/w of the dry leaves weight (DLW)) was dissolved in distilled water and fractionated through liquid–liquid partition using ethyl acetate (EA) and n-BuOH (BU) (5× 300 mL each) to yield EA (2.2 g, 2.2%, w/w DLW) and BU (10.7 g, 10.7%, w/w DLW) fractions, respectively. BU fraction was subjected to CC using XAD7 (46.0 cm × 4.0 cm) and subsequent elution with 500 mL of water (WV), water/MeOH 1:1 (WMV) and 2 L of MeOH (MV). One gram of the dried fraction MV (6.75 g, 6.75%, w/w DLW) was chromatographed over Sephadex LH-20 (53.0 cm × 3.0 cm) using MeOH as eluent resulting in 41 frac- tions of 30 mL, which were pooled into seven fractions (MV1 to MV7). Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg, 1.13%, w/w DLW) was rechromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with MeOH. Twenty-three fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven (MV4s to MV4z). Frac- tion 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg, 0.39% w/w DLW) was further puriﬁed by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase MeOH, ﬂow-rate 3 mL min−1; λ 330 nm) to yield com- pounds 1 and 2 (5.5 mg, 0.04%, w/w DLW), substances 3 and 4 (3.1 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) after three cycles of 54 min. Frac- tion 5 (MV5, 293.1 mg, 1.98%, w/w DLW) was submitted to the same R-HPLC system to yield compounds 5 and 6 (20.5 mg, 0.14%, w/w DLW) as mixture, and compounds 7 and 8 (3.0 mg, 0.02%, w/w DLW) also as mixture. Fraction WV, after recrys- tallization in 90% aqueous MeOH solution, afforded substance 9 (280.0 mg). 5. Results From n-BuOH partition of hydroalcoholic extract of leaves from Vitex polygama were isolated the compounds caffeoyl 6- O-�-d-glucopyranoside (1), caffeoyl 6-O-�-d-glucopyranoside (2), schaftoside (3), isoschaftoside (4), orientin (5), isoorientin (6), carlinoside (7), isocarlinoside (8) and metacrylic acid (9) whose chemical structures (Fig. 1) were identiﬁed by means of 1H and 13C NMR as well as HMBC, HSQC and negative ESI/MS spectra data which were in accordance with previously reported data (Kitagawa, 1984; Besson et al., 1985; Dayrit et al., 1987; Shimomura et al., 1988). Schaftoside and its isomer is known for its efﬁcacy as anti-inﬂammatory (Melo et al., 2005) and preventive effect against kidney stone in rats, as evaluated by urine output, excretion of Ca, citric acid, and creatinine analysis (Kubo et al., 1989). Moreover the C-glycosidic ﬂavones 3, 4, 7 and 8 are being reported for the ﬁrst time in the genus Vitex.
