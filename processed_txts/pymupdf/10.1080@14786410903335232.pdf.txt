NF�B regulates the expression of several genes involved in carcinogenesis. These include anti-apoptotic, cytokines and cell cycle-regulatory genes. It is well established that the transcriptional factor NF�B is deregulated in many forms of cancer. Thus, agents that can suppress NF�B activation have the potential of suppressing carcinogenesis. In the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from Alchornea glandulosa (Euphorbiaceae) and eight esters were synthesised. These compounds were evaluated against TNF-�-induced NF�B activation with stably transfected 293/NF�B-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Gallates with IC50 values in a range of 10–56 mM mediated inhibitory activity higher than gallic acid (IC50 76.0 � 4.9 mM). In addition to inhibiting NF�B activation, gallic acid mediated a modest cytotoxic effect, and some of the gallates affected cell viability at the tested concentrations. Based on these results, suppression of NF�B activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis. Keywords: gallic acid; NF�B pathway; cytotoxicity; 293/NF�B cells; Alchornea glandulosa; cancer chemoprevention 1. Introduction Phenolic acids are natural products which possess a wide spectrum of biological activity (Nazaruk, Czechowska, Markiewicz, & Borawska, 2008). yBoth authors contributed equally to this paper. *Corresponding author.

Nihei & A. Nihei, 2004). It is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as salts and esters. Some ointments used to treat psoriasis and external hemorrhoids contain gallic acid (Garcı´a de Hombre & Pe´ rez Pen˜ ate, 2006; Hatton, 2000). Gallic acid has two major functional groups, hydroxyls and a carboxylic acid, which can yield numerous esters and salt derivatives. Some galloyl compounds are used as antioxidants in food and can exhibit important roles in prevention of inflammatory and atherosclerosis responses by blocking activation of NF�B (Murase et al., 1999). NF�B consists of homo and heterodimeric protein complexes acting as a transcription factor, and is found in many animal cell types. It is involved in regulation of immune response and inflammation, cell lineage development, cell apoptosis, cell-cycle progression and oncogenesis due to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidised LDL and microbial antigens, and has been shown to regulate the expression of several genes, including bcl-2, bcl-xl, cIAP, survivin, TRAF, COX-2, MMP-9, iNOS and cell cycle-regulatory components, whose products are involved in tumourigenesis (Aggarwal, Sethi, Nair, & Ichikawa, 2006; Chen, Castranova, & Shi, 2001; Melisi & Chiao, 2007; Thanos & Maniatis, 1995). Most carcinogens, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1, or tumour promoters, including cigarette smoke, phorbol esters, okadaic acid, H2O2, have been shown to activate NF�B, and resulting tumours have misregulated NF�B activity (Baldwin, 2001). It is now well established that aberrant regulation of NF�B, and the signalling pathways that control its activity, are involved in cancer development and progression, as well as in drug resistance, especially during chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Inoue, Gohda, Akiyama, & Semba, 2007). Blocking NF�B can cause tumour cells to stop proliferating, undergo apoptosis, or to become more sensitive to the action of antitumour agents (Frydrych & Mlejnek, 2008; Yamamoto & Gaynor, 2001). Thus, agents that can suppress NF�B activation have the potential to suppress carcinogenesis or tumourigenesis. In the present investigation, gallic acid was isolated from Alchornea glandulosa Poepp and Endl. (Euphorbiaceae), and eight semi-synthetic esters were prepared. All the compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity as well as potential to inhibit TNF-�-induced NF�B activation with stably transfected 293/NF�B-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Methanol, n-hexane, ethyl acetate and p-dioxane were of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade (JT Baker). Column chromatography was carried out over silica gel (0.06–0.20 mm, Acros Organics). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech). Preparative HPLC was carried out using a Varian Prep-Star 400 system and a Phenomenex C-18 (250 mm � 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional NMR experiments were Natural Product Research 1759 Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014  recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as solvent (Aldrich). Alkyl alcohols and DCC were purchased from Aldrich. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and sulphorho- damine B (SRB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), antibiotic–antimycotic, hygro- mycin B, and MEM sodium pyruvate were purchased from Invitrogen Co. (Carlsbad, CA). Reporter Lysis Buffer, Luciferase Assay System was purchased from Promega (Madison). Tumour Necrosis Factor-� (TNF-�) was purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ). Alcohol was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). 2.2. Isolation of gallic acid The leaves of A. glandulosa were collected in the Biological Reserve and Experimental Station at Mogi Guac¸ u, Sa˜ o Paulo State, Brazil, in March 2005. A voucher specimen (SP319257) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (Sa˜ o Paulo-SP, Brazil). The shade-dried plant material (1.5 kg) was ground and defatted with n-hexane (3.5 L � 3) at room temperature and exhaustively extracted by maceration with MeOH (4.2 L � 3). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 3.8 g of a syrup residue, which was diluted with MeOH : H2O (4 : 1) and then successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After evaporation under reduced pressure, the partition phases yielded 2.5 g and 0.8 g, respectively. The part of EtOAc residue (2.0 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford 11 fractions (A1–A11). Fraction A2 (730 mg) was purified by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : HOAc (7.5 : 92 : 0.5), UV detection at 265 nm; flow rate 15 mL min�1] to give compound 1 (335 mg). Compound 1 was identified as gallic acid based on analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR data, as well as by comparison with authentic material in our laboratory (Figure 1).

Molecular structures of gallic acid (1) and semi-synthetic esters (2–9). 1760 M.C.C. Morais et al. Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014  2.3. Synthesis of esters 2–9 After being cooled at 5�C, the mixture of gallic acid (0.2 mmol) and alcohol (20 mmol) in p-dioxane (6.0 mL) was added to a solution of N,N0-dicyclohexylcar- bodiimide (DCC, 1.0 mmol) in p-dioxane (3.0 mL). The solution was stirred for 48 h, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned three times with EtOAc and then filtered. The filtrate was washed successively with saturated aqueous citric acid solution (three times), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (three times), water (two times), dried over MgSO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified over a silica gel column using an isocratic system of CHCl3–MeOH (98 : 2) to give gallate esters 2–8. Structures of the semi- synthetic esters, methyl gallate (2), ethyl gallate (3), n-propyl gallate (4), isopropyl gallate (5), n-butyl gallate (6), isobutyl gallate (7), n-pentyl gallate (8) and 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid (9), were established by 1H and 13C NMR spectral analysis (Figure 1). For synthesis of ester 9, gallic acid (20 mmol) was dissolved in dry pyridine (5.0 mL) and anhydride acetic (5.0 mL) under hydrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature, carried to dryness under reduced pressure, and purified by column chromatography with a mixture of CHCl3–MeOH (85 : 15) to give a product (9). The NMR spectroscopic data of 9 were compatible with 3,4, 5-triacetoxybenzoic acid. 2.4. NFjB luciferase assay NF�B inhibition assay was conducted using a luciferase reporter gene bioassay as previously described (Homhual et al., 2006). Human embryonic kidney cells (293/ NF�B-Luc) were used to monitor alteration of the NF�B pathway. This cell line is stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct regulated by the NF�B response element. Transcription factor can bind to the response element when stimulated by TNF-�, allowing transcription of the luciferase gene. Luciferase reacts with substrate, emitting light that was detected using a luminometer. Cells were seeded (105 cells mL�1) on sterile white walled 96-well plates and grown to approximately 80% confluence by incubating for 48 h. Gallic acid and alkyl gallates were tested at 20 mg mL�1 following 1 : 3 serial dilutions. After treatment with tested compounds for 10 min, cells were incubated for an additional 6 h with or without TNF-� (5 ng mL�1). The cells were gently washed with PBS and kept at �80�C with luciferase lysis buffer (Promega Corporation). The luciferase assay was performed using the Luc assay system from Promega following manufacturer instructions. Luciferase activity was monitored (LUMIstar Galaxy BMG), dose-response curves were constructed, and results were expressed as IC50 values (i.e. concentration required to inhibit TNF-� induced NF�B activity by 50%). 2.5. Cytotoxicity assay Cytotoxicity was determined by the method of Skehan et al. (1990). The cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid and stained for 30 min with 0.4% (w/v) sulphorho- damine B (SRB) prepared in 1% acetic acid. Unbound dye was removed by washing with 1% acetic acid, and protein-bound dye was extracted with 10 mM Tris base Natural Product Research 1761 Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014  [tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane] for determination of optical density in a computer-interfaced, 96-well microtiter plate reader. 2.6. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism� Version 5.01 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Results were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and differences between means were located using Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Differences between means at the 5% (p 5 0.05) level were considered significant. The data are expressed as means � standard error. 3. Results and discussion Herein we report cytotoxic properties and suppression of TNF-� induced NF�B activation of gallic acid (1) and eight esters (2–9) determined with stably transfected 293/NF�B-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. Table 1 shows the concentrations of gallates 1–9 required to inhibit NF�B-induced activation in 50% (IC50). N-Tosyl- L-phenylalaninyl-chlormethylketone (TPCK) was adopted as positive control, exhibiting 98.5% � 0.5% NF�B inhibition at 30 mM, with an IC50 value of about 5 mM. At the highest concentration tested (20.0 mg mL�1), gallic acid mediated a moderate cytotoxic effect (52.9% � 3.5% survival), but none of the gallate esters significantly affected cell viability. The most cytotoxic compound evaluated was 6, with 48.9% � 3.3% cell survival. Among inhibitors of NF�B, salicylates, aspirin (Kopp & Ghosh, 1994), apigenin and curcumin (Gerritsen et al., 1995; Singh & Aggarwal, 1996) were reported to suppress activation of NF�B by preventing the degradation of the NF�B inhibitor (I�B), and therefore NF�B was retained in the cytosol. The serine protease inhibitor TPCK can cause a complete block to NF�B activation. TPCK inhibits NF�B subunits processing and I�B degradation (Mellitis, Hay, & Goodbourn, 1993). It has also been demonstrated that TPCK inhibits DNA replication by G0–G1 growth arrest and thus promotes apoptosis by other cytotoxic stimuli (Kirillova, Chaisson, & Fausto, 1999). Table 1.

Downloaded by [Aston University] at 17:57 20 January 2014  The present study provides evidence that some gallates can act as inhibitors of NF�B. Methyl gallate (2) demonstrated the greatest activity. The inhibitory actions of gallates do not appear to result from non-specific cellular toxicity but rather are specific for NF�B-dependent gene transcription. In another study, it has been demonstrated that gallates can inhibit TNF-�-induced nuclear translocation of NF�B by way of a mechanism independent of I�B degradation (Murase et al., 1999). More recently, prevention of atherosclerosis, cancer, anti-plasmodial and antioxidant activity of a group of galloyl compounds was described, as well as structure-activity relationships yielding cytotoxic properties (Fiuza et al., 2004; Jagan, Ramakrishnan, Anandakumar, Kamaraj, & Devaki, 2008; Locatelli et al., 2008; Murase et al., 1999; Na et al., 2006; Petroˆ nio et al., 2007; Saxena et al., 2008). Based on these encouraging intracellular responses, we suggest suppression of NF�B activation by gallate esters could play a chemopreventive role in carcinogenesis, and further investigations related to the actions of gallates, especially in NF�B signaling pathway and in vivo models, may provide new insights into the cancer chemopreventive ability.
