In  addition, the known compounds (E, E)-N-(2-methylpropyl)-2Ptetradecadienamide,  (E)-3,4-dimethoxycirmnamic acid  and /%sitosterol were also isolated and characterized.  ~anthoxyium ~~t~~liurn Engl. (syn. Fagata ac~t~~~~~~ is  a small tree of the tropical forests of Minas Gerais State  (Lagoa Santa) and Slo Paulo State [l]. As part of a  continuing study of the chemistry of Zanthoxylum [23, we  have examined the leaves of this previously uninvestiga-  ted species.  RFSUX,TS AND IWXXJSSIDN  The dichlo~methane  and methanol  extracts of the  leaves of 2. ~~~~~~~~  on chromatography  over silica  gel and preparative  TLC, afforded five new quinolone  alkaloids,  ~u~olin  (I), acutifo~din  (2}, O-methyl-  acutifolin (3), acutifolin palmitate (4), and neoacutifolin  (5), in addition  to the known compounds  (E, Q-N-(2-  methylpropyl)-2,4_tetradecadienamide,  (E)-3,4-dimeth-  oxycinnamic  acid and fi-sitosterol.  The known  com-  pounds were identified by comparison  with published  data [3-61.  Acutifol~ (1) exhibited similar spectral data to lunacri-  dine {6), which has previously been isolated from Lunusia  amuru and L. c&data (Rutaceae) [7, 81. The ‘HNMR  spectrum (Tabie i), instead of signals for an isopropyl  moiety, showed two broad 1H singlets for an exomethyl-  ene (6 5.06,4.83) and a broad singlet for a viny& methy  (6 1.86). These signals and the mass spectral fragm~t  at  m/z 232 [M - C,H,O] + required the presence of ex-  omethylene at C-3’ of the sidechain of hmacridine. This  was supported  by the i3C NMR spectrum  (Table 2)  which agreed closely with published data for l-demethyl-  8-demethoxyacutifolin  (7) available  by synthesis  [8].  The above data are in agreement with structure  1, N-  methyl-3-(2’-hydroxy-3’-methylbut-3’-enyl-4,S-dimeth-  oxy-Zquinolone,  for acutifolin.  Acut$lidin  (2), showed spectral characteristics close to  those of 1.

These data together with the  mass and ’ 3C NMR (Table 2) spectral data are consistent  with 2 being an ~-dem~hylacutifolin  derivative.  The alkaloid 3 also showed the spectral characteristics  of an acutifolin derivative, except for the presence of an  aliphatic methoxy group @3.16,56.2, Tables t and 2). The  mass spectrum gave a base peak at m/z 85 (C5M90) which  indicated a methoxyl at C-2’ of the sidechain. The new  alkaloid is, therefore, U-methylacutifol~.  Compound  4, was also found to be an acutifolin  derivative, with the IH and 13CNMR spectra (Tables 1  3617  3618  M. S. P. ARRUDA et al.

The mass spectrum gave significant fragments  for  m/z  286  [M -OCO(CH,),,Me]  +  and  256  [Me(CH2),.C0,H]+  supporting the structure as that of  the novel alkaloid acutifolin palmitate (4).  Neoacutifolin (5), was very closely related to balfouro-  dine (8), previously isolated from Balfourodendron  riedel-  ianum and Pteleu  trifoliata  (Rutaceae) [7]. The ‘H and  13C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2), in addition to signals  typical of a dihydrofuroquinolin-4one,  revealed the pre-  sence of an isopropenyl  system. The mass spectrum  showed peak for loss of C,H, from the [Ml+ ion (m/z  230) which pointed to an isopropenyl group attached to  the dihydrofuran  ring on C-2’, confirming  that neo-  acutifolin has structure 5.  The range of albaloids found in 2. acutifolium  is typical  of the Rutaceae [7]. Murray [9] has pointed out that  coumarin production is generally highest around the time  of flowering. The leaves of Z. acutzfolium  were collected in  December, before the flowering and fruiting season. This  appears to explain the absence of coumarins  in this  species.  EXPERIMENTAL  NMR: CDCI, with TMS as int. standard; MS: 70 eV, direct  probe insert and elevated temp.  Plant material: Aerial parts of Zanthoxylum  acutifolium were  collected from the Jatai Reserve, Slo Paulo, Brazil (Dec. 1987)  and a voucher is deposited at the Herbarium of the Instituto de  Biociincias, Universidade de Sgo Paulo, SHo Paulo, SP.  Extraction  and isolation of compounds  l-5. The leaves (190 g)  of Z. acutifolium  were dried and extracted with CH,Cl,  and  MeOH. The CH,Cl, extract (5.3 g) was subjected to VLC over  silica gel eluting with hexane, hexane-CH,Cl,  (1: 1), CH,Cl,,  CH,Cl,-Me,CO  (19: l), Me,CO and MeOH to give 7 frs, three  of which were rechromatographed  as above. Frs 5 and 6 gave 1  (52 mg), 2 (8 mg), 4 (19 mg), 5 (8 me) and (E)-3,4-dimethoxy-  cinnamic acid (4 mg). Fr. 4 was then purified by prep. TLC on  silica gel using CHCl,-Me,CO  (49:1), to afford (E&)-N-(2-  methylpropyl)-2,4-tetradecadienamide  (29 mg) and /3-sitosterol  (30mg). The MeOH extract (23.7 g, used only lO.Og) was  subjected to VLC over silica gel eluting with hexane containing  increasing amounts of EtOAc to gve a polar fr. which was  purified by prep. TLC on silica gel using hexane-EtOAc  (3:2)  yielding 1 (51 mg) and 3 (50 mg).  (E,E)-N-(2-methylpropyl)-2,4-Tetradecadienamide,  W-3,4-  dimethoxy-cinnamic  acid and p-siaosterol.
