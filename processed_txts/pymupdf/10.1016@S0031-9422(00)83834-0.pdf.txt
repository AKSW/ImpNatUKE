INTRODUCIION  Wood  of Aniba  santalodora  Ducke,  ‘louro  umiri’,  a  lauraceous  tree from the Manaus  region of Amazonas  State,  Brazil,  upon solvent  extraction  yielded  an oily  constituent,  identified  as benzyl  benzoate,  and a crys-  talline  substance  called cecilin.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The structural  proposal  1 for cecilin was based on its  ‘H NMR  spectrum  which  shows  an AA’BB’  system  at T 2.82 and 3.35 (shifted  to T 2.56 and 2.96 in cecilin  acetate)  characteristic  of a 4-hydroxyphenyl  group,  a  singlet  (7 5.67) for the benzylic  protons,  the typical  H-3, H-4 doublets  (T 1.78 and 2.04, J = 5 Hz) of the  carboline  unit,  a singlet  (~6.13)  for the  methoxyl,  besides  two doublets  (7 2.22,  J = 2.0 and 2.47,  J =  8.5 Hz) and one double-doublet  (T 2.79, J = 2.0 and  8.5 Hz) assigned  respectively  to H-5,  H-8 and H-7.  The only alternative  assignment  compatible  with these  multiplicities  and coupling  constants  was ruled out by  comparison  of the chemical  shifts with those  of H-8  (T 2.66, J = 2.1 Hz), H-5  (T 1.88, J = 8.6 Hz) and H-6  (T 3.13, J = 2.1 and 8.6 Hz) for the model compound  2  (in the same DMSO-solvent  [2]).  The structural  proposal  for cecilin was confirmed  by  a two-step  synthesis  involving  condensation  of (*)-5-  methoxytryptophan  with p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic  acid  [3] to 3 and concomitant  oxidation/decarboxylation  of  this intermediate  to 1. The condensation  procedure  was adapted  from procedures  described  for mechanis-  tically  analogous  reactions  of tryptophans  or tryp-  tamines  with phenylacetic  aldehydes  [4-61 and of tryp-  tamines  with phenylpyruvic  acid [7]. The aromatiza-  tion procedure  has been  used previously  for similar  purposes  [8,9].  * Part  LX  in the  series  “The  Chemistry  of Brazilian  Lauraceae”.  For Part LIX see ref. [l].  OH  1  Meo%$qQ  06-I  2  2  OH  3  While benzyl  benzoate  has been isolated  from most  Aniba  species  [lo], tryptophan-derived  alkaloids,  such  as  2-N-methyl-6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-B-car-  boline from Nectondru  megapotamica  (Sprg.) Chod. et  Hassl. [ 111, are very rare in Lauraceae.  The common  alkaloids  of this family,  and the genus  Aniba  is no  exception  [12], are derived  from  phenylalanine  [ 131.  1859  1860  Short Reports  Cecilin  (1)  is of mixed  biosynthetic  origin,  deriving  from both  these  aromatic  amino  acids.  A recent  re-  view on @-carboline  alkaloids  does not report  a single  representative  of this  type  [14], such  derivation  is  therefore  a rare feature  indeed  for a natural  product.  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation of constituents. Air-dried,  ground  trunk  wood  (4 kg), obtained  from a sample  collected  between  km 14 and  19 of the  Manaus-Itacoatiara  road  and  identified  by the  botanist  Dr.  William  A. Rodrigues,  was percolated  with  EtOH.  The solvent  was evapd  and the residue  (400 gj ex-  tracted  with petrol  in a Soxhlet  apparatus.  The solvent  was  evapd  and  the residue  (2Og)  chromatographed  on Si gel.  Elution  with CHCl,  and CHCIs-MeOH  (19: 1) gave respec-  tively benzyl benzoate  and a product  which, when recrystal-  lized from EtOH,  gave cecilin.  Cecilin  (1). mp 224-228”  dec.
