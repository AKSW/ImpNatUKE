Abstract-The  trunk  wood of Emmutum nitens (Icacinaceae) contains  the aromatic  sesquiterpenes  (2R,3S)-  2-hydroxy-3-(2’-hydroxyisopropyl)-5,8-dimethyl-l-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthale  @mot&F),  2-hydroxy-3-(2’-  hydroxyisopropyl)-5,8-dimethylnaphthalene  (emmotin-G)  and 3-(i’-hydroxyisopropyl)-5,8-dimethyl-l,2-naphtho-  quinone (emmotin-H). The identity of the carbon skeletons of these emmotins was proved by conversion of all  three into an identical quinoxaline derivative. The nature of this skeleton and the absolute configuration of emmo-  tin-F, as well as of the previously described emmotins A and B, was established by conversion of emmotin-F  into (+ )-occidol.  Rl2WL.l-S AND DISCUSSION  Emmtum nitens (Benth.) Miers, an arboreous Icacinaceae  species, has a wide geographical distribution.  A trunk  wood sample from a specimen growing in the vicinity  of Diamantina,  Minas Gerais, contained two sesquiter-  penoid tetralins, designated emmotin-A (la) and -B (lb),  and  two  sesquiterpenoid  naphthalenes,  designated  emmotin-C  (2) and -D (3). Their structural  proposals  were based mainly on PMR evidence, and, consequently,  only the relative configurations  for C-2 and C-3 of  emmotin-A and -B were established. Allocation of the  substituents to C-5, based on 13C NMR evidence in the  case of emmotin-A and -B, was considered a reasonable  postulate also for emmotin-C and -D in the light of a  probable biogenetic relationship [ 11.  The chemical investigation  of another  trunk wood  sample, collected  from a specimen  growing  in the  Linhares Reserve, Rio Dote, Espirito Santo, where the  species is known as “faia”, revealed three different wm-  pounds. Elemental analysis and MS MW determination  indicated their formulae to be CI,HzOO,  (emmotin-F,  lc), C15H1sOa (emmotin-G, 4a) and C15H1603 (emmo-  tin-H, 5).

[l]. Abstracted from the Doctorate  thesis submitted by C.T.M.L. to Universidade Federal de  Minas Gerais (1975). Sponsored by Minis&o  do Planeja-  mento (FINEP) through Academia Brasileira de Ci&cias and  contract FNDCf No. 154/C.T., by Conselho National de  Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnoMgico, and by a CAPES-  fellowship to C.T.M.L.  tion assigned the three oxygens of emmotin-F  to two  OH and one CO functions. The CO function must be  substituted by a benzene ring and one of the carbinols.  Evidence for conjugation with the benzene ring are UV  (k,, 259 nm, E 11200) and IR (vmax 1680 cm-‘) spectra,  as well as ease of catalytic hydrogenolysis of emmotin-F  to a diol (6a). Evidence for vicinality with a CHOH  group was found in the formation of a red oquinone  (7) upon dehydrogenation  of emmotin-F  with Pd-C in  refluxing xylene. Functionality  and structural features of  7 were established by derivatization  with o-phenylene-  diamine to a quinoxaline, CZIH1sN1 (8). An isopropenyl  group (z 7.47, t, J 1.5 Hz [3H] and 4.53, q, J 1.5 Hz  [2H]) is present in this compound (8), as well as in a  derivative (9) obtained  by heating emmotin-F  or its  diacetate (Id) in TsOH-Ac,O,  and shows the additional  carbinol of emmotin-F  to be part of a hydroxypropyl  unit.  ?&;  &  Hofi  (la)R’=R3=H,RZ=OMe  (2)  (3)  (lb) R’ = OH.R’= OMe,R3=H  (Id R’ = ti * d = H  (Id) R’ = R2=H,R3.Ac  (la) R’ = H, R*= OMe, R3mAC  Ro*:  HOz5$:  Jp$  140) R.“,  (45,  (4b) R =Ac  &,’  :: I$:;  1267  1268  A. B. DE OLIVEIR~ et al.  These facts, in conjunction  with the interpretation  of  the PMR spectrum, which was very similar to those  ofemmotin-A  (la) and -3 (1h) (Table l), led to the tenta-  tive classification of emmotin-F as the tetralone emmotin  lc. Both emmotin-A diacetate (le) El] and emmotin-F  diacetate (ld) were d~~toxyIat~  on reduction with Zn.  The derivative (lOa), submitted suceessivefy to catalytic  hydro~nolysis  and  ~~~~tion*  gave (+)-occidol  (#lb), characterized  by mp, opticaf rotation  [2] and  direct UV, IR and PMR spectral comparison  with a  sample of synthetic  (k)-occidol  kindly  supplied  by  Dr. Y. Hirose, Faculty  of Agriculture,  University  of  Tokyo, Japan. This correlation es~b~h~  not only the  carbon  skeleton  and  3~o~guration,  but also the  2R-configuration  of emmotin-F,  in view of the trapts-  diaxiai relationship of H-2 and H-3, evidenced by PMR  data (Table 1).  The ORD curve of emmotin-F  is su~r~~~b~e  on  those given by emmotins A (la) and B (lb), compounds  in which the substituent~ at C-2 and C-3 also are trms.  Ah three tetralone  emmotins,  thus, possess identical  absolute configurations.  The constitution  and absolute  configuration  of the previously mentioned dial can now  be confidently formulated as 6a. The racemates of 6a  and lob were prepared during a synthesis of (A)-rishi-  tin01 (6b) [3]. The published data on these products,  however, are insuf%cient to validate comparisons  with  our ~rn~un~.  If it is admitted, as a working h~~~~  that the  carbon skeleton of emmotin-F  prevails in emmotin-G  and -Ii, only the respective formulae 431 and 5 can  represent  these ~m~unds.

As expected acetylation of e~ut~-G  (to 4b) caused  a strong ~r~gneti~  shift {A 0.59 ppm) of the H-l sing-  let, and oxidation with Fremy’s salt at room temperature  yielded emmotin-H (9. Attempted direct a~tyla~on  of  5 under a variety of conditions led to mixtures. in con-  tradistinction, either reductive acetylation in presence of  zinc or acetylation of the quinoxabne derivative 12 gave  good yields of isopropenyt compounds, 13 and 8 respect-  ively. Since the dehydra~on  product 8 is equally avait-  able from emmotin-F  the initial hypothesis is correct.  and also the emmotins G and H must possess the car-  bon skeleton of occidol @lb).  The 3S~o~~a~on  of the emmotins is typical of the  natural eudesmane type sesquiterpenes. This fact suggests  their biogenetic  relationship  with this class of corn-  pounds. It is, cons~u~dy,  proposed that their biosyn-  thesis, by analogy with that of occidol [4], should in-  volve a one carbon shift by a dienol-benzene rearrange-  ment of an eudesmane type precursor.
