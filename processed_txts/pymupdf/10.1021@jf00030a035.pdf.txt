Vieira, and Sakae Komatsu  Division of Entomology and Parasitology, College of Natural Resources, University of California,  Berkeley, California 94720  Three anacardic acids (1-3) have been isolated as cytotoxic agents against BT-20  breast carcinoma cells  from the cashew Anacardium occidentale (Anacardiaceae) apple juice. In addition to these anacardic  acids, the cytotoxicity of their 13 congeners (4-16) isolated from the cashew nut and nut shell oil has  also been examined. Anacardic acids (1-4), cardols (5-81, and methylcardols (9-12) have been found  to exhibit moderate cytotoxic activity against both BT-20 breast and HeLa epithelioid cervix carcinoma  cells.  INTRODUCTION  We now control many tumors with available antitumor  agents. However, the need for new antitumor agents still  exists, especially against solid tumors. The unacceptable  and undesired side effects of many antitumor agents are  a major problem that needs to be improved, due to the  need for the antitumor agents to be used for long durations.  It seems that edible plants may be a good source of new  antitumor agents. With this in mind, we have screened  for new antitumor agents from various tropical fruits and  vegetables that have been continuously consumed by many  people for many years.  In recent years the cashew (Anacardium occidentale  L.) (Anacardiaceae) apple has increased in value, especially  in the countries where it is grown, such as Brazil. There  is no doubt that the nut is the most important product of  the cashew tree. However, this tree also yields the pear-  shaped "apple" to which the nut is attached. The cashew  apple is very sour and astringent until fully ripe, when it  becomes edible. In contrast to the nut, the apple was  neglected until recently, although it is available in far  greater tonnage. A number of processes have now been  developed for converting the cashew apple into various  products such as juice, jam, syrup, chutney, and beverage  (Winterhalter, 1991). Cashew apple juice is, in fact, one  of the most popular juices in Brazil today.  In our continuing search for prostaglandin synthetase  inhibitors from tropical plants (Kubo et al., 1987) we began  to test their antitumor activity, since many prostaglandin-  related compounds exhibited potent antitumor activity  (Zenser et al., 1980; Powles et al., 1982). Our preliminary  screening has found the cashew (A. occidentale) apple  juice to show significant (EDXI <20 pg/mL) in vitro  cytotoxicity against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells. The  active principles from a regularly imbibed beverage such  as cashew apple juice may be superior as antitumor agents  as compared to many nonnatural products. This paper  deals with the identification of cytotoxic principles of  cashew apple juice.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  General. UV spectra were recorded on a Hitachi 100-80  spectrophotometer in ethanol. IR spectra were acquired on a  Perkin-Elmer 1310 IR in KBr. NMR spectra were recorded on  a JEOL GX-400 (400 MHz for lH and 100 MHz for l3C) in CDCl,.  EIMS were acquired on a JEOL DX-303HF by direct inlet 70 eV.  Recycle HPLC (R-HPLC) was performed on a LC-09 (Japan  Analytical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) (Kubo and Nakatsu, 1991).  Chemicals. The phenolic compounds 1-16 (Figure 1) used  for bioassay were from our previous study (Kubo et al., 1986).  However, the repurification of some of them was achieved by  R-HPLC. Anethole was isolated from the seeds of Pimpinella  anisum (Umbelliferae) as previously described (Kubo and  Himejima, 1991). Indole, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA),  vitamin C, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazo-  lium bromide (M'M') were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.  (St. Louis, MO).  Plant Materials. Suco de Caju, a commercial cashew apple  juice (Maguary and Milani) was purchased at market places in  SHo Paulo, SHo Carlos, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Cell Lines and Media. The cell lines BT-20 ATCC HTB 19,  breast carcinoma isolated from human, and HeLa ATCC CCL  219, epithelioid cervix carcinoma cell from human, used for the  assay were purchased from American Type Culture Collection  (Rockville, MD). Both cell lines were maintained on minimum  essential medium (Eagle) with nonessential amino acids supple-  mented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and  incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO1-95 % air at 37  "C. Thehumanmonolayer culture weresubculturedwitha0.25%  trypsin/EDTA solution.  Cytotoxic Assay. The cytotoxic assays were performed  according to a microculture tetrazolium (MTT) method (Car-  michaelet d., 1987). Briefly, cells were harvested and inoculated  into 96-well microtiter plates at 4000-6000 celldwell, with various  concentrations of the samples. After incubation, 50 Fg/mL MTT  (3 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.2) was added. The form-  dye was  solubilized by adding 100 pg/mL DMSO to each well, followed  by gentle shaking. The extinction coefficient was measured for  each well using a Uniskan I Photometer Labsystem, at a  wavelength of 620 nm.  Combination Study. The combination data were obtained  according to the checkerboard method (Norden et al., 1979). Thus,  a series of the 2-fold dilutions of anacardic acid (1) was tested  in combination with 2-fold dilutions of the other (anethole, indole,  BHA, and vitamin C) (Figure 2). Each compound was tested at  least twice.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The cytotoxicity-guided fractionation using BT-20  breast carcinoma cells has led to the isolation of three  active principles from the cashew (A. occidentale) apple  by R-HPLC using an ODS Cle column. The active  compounds were identified by means of spectroscopic  methods as anacardic acids, more specifically, 6-[8(Z),-  11 (2)  ,1Cpentadecatrienyllsalicylic acid (11, 6-  [8(2),11-  (2)-pentadecadienyllsalicylic acid (21, and 6- [8(Z)-pen-  tadecenyl] salicylic acid (3). These nonisoprenoid alkyl  side chain phenolic compounds were previously isolated  from the cashew (A. occidentale) nut shell oil together  0021-856 11931 1441-10 12$04.00/0  1993 Amerlcan Chemlcal Soclety  Antkumor Agents from Cashew  J.

Similar nonisoprenoid long-chain phe-  nols including anacardic acid (3) were isolated as antitumor  agents against Sarcoma ascites in mice from the sarcotesta  of Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae) (Itokawa et al., 1987).  In addition to the 3 above-mentioned anacardic acids  (1-3) isolated from the cashew apple, 13 additional  phenolic compounds (4-16) isolated from the cashew nut  and cashew nut shell oil (Tyman, 1979) were also examined  for comparison purposes. They were first assayed against  BT-20 breast carcinoma cells at 10 pg/mL. As a result,  anacardic acids (1-4), cardols (5-81, and methylcardol(9-  12) exhibited significant cytotoxicity. Interestingly, car-  danols (13-16) did not demonstrate significant activity  against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells, although 5-[8(2),-  11(Z),14-pentadecatrienyllresorcinol (5) was previously  reported to exhibit potent antitumor activity against  Sarcoma 180 ascites in mice (Itokawa et al., 1987).  The EDm values of the phenolic compounds (1-12) were  first obtained against BT-20 breast carcinoma cells (Table  I). Then, only the active compounds (EDm < 10 pg/mL)  were tested against HeLa epitheloidid cervix carcinoma  cells. The most effective cytotoxicity was observed for  the cardols, followed by the anacardic acids and then the  1014 J. Agric. FoodChem., Vol. 41, No. 6, 1993  B H A   Kubo et el.

In ai lition to the natura. phenolic com-  pounds (1-16), salicylic acid (17) and resorcinol (18) were  also tested. Neither salicylic acid nor resorcinol exhibited  any activity against these two carcinoma cells at this  concentration. By comparison of salicylic acid (17) and  resorcinol (18) with the corresponding anacardic acids (1-  4) and cardols (5-81, it seems that the addition of a CIS  alkyl side chain plays an important role in increasing the  cytotoxicity. In fact, logP (as the hydrophobic parameter)  of long-chain phenols was found to be one of the most  important factors for the EDm values against Chinese  hamster V-79 cells (Itokawa et al., 1989).  Moreover, all of the phenolic compounds isolated from  the cashew (nut, apple, and nut shell oil) have a CU alkyl  side chain with up to three double bonds. In the previous  investigation of their molluscicidal and antimicrobial  activities, an increase in the number of double bonds in  the side chain, in general, increases the biological activity  (Gellerman et al., 1969; Himejima and Kubo, 1991; Kubo  et al., 1986). However, this seems not to be the case in the  cytotoxic activity, although the phenolics possessing a CIS  saturated alkyl side chain were found to be somehow less  cytotoxic than the ones with a CIS unsaturated alkylgroup.  Although the cytotoxicity of these phenolics may not be  potent enough to use them as a leading compound for  drug design, they are worthy of further investigation as  natural producta isolated from a daily beverage. Therefore,  the enhancement of their cytotoxicity by combining them  with other substances was studied. The procedure for  selecting these "other substances" is, however, still in a  preliminary stage. The initial selection of other substances  was based largely on our previous combination studies of  antimicrobial agents. For example, the antifungal activity  of polygodial against a filamentous fungus Candida  albicans was enhanced 32-fold by combining it with  sublethal amounts of anethole (Kubaand Himejima, 1991).  Similarly, the antibacterial activity of crinitol against a  cariogenic bactarium Streptococcus mutans was increased  64fold by BHT (Kubo et al., 1992a), and that of 6-cadinene  was enhanced 128-fold by indole (Kubo et al., 1992b).  Vitamin C was also added for the combination study  because of its high content in the cashew apple. Thus, the  ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content in the cashew apple is  reported to be greater than 6 times that for oranges (Cecchi  and Rodriguez-Amaya, 1981). Moreover, vitamin C (anti-  oxidant) was found to increase the antifungal activity of  both polygodial and warburganal 16-fold against a der-  matomycotic fungus Pityrosporum ouale (Kubo and  Himejima, 1992). Since these four compounds have been  used as food additives, we can assume that their safety  has been established.  For the combination study, 6-[8(2),11(2),14-pentade-  catrienyllsalicylic acid (I), otherwise known as anacardic  acid, was selected for the following reasons: (1) it has  been isolated from the edible cashew apple; (2) its ED60  values against the two human solid tumor (BT-20 breast  and HeLa epitheloidid cervix) cells are less than 4 pg/mL,  that is, it satisfies the NCI requirement to warrant further  investigation; and (3) most importantly for conducting  this experiment, it is available in quantity.  Anacardic acid (1) was, therefore, combined with  anethole, BHA, indole, and vitamin C, respectively. The  combination study was carried out against BT-20 breast  carcinoma cells by the checkerboard method (Norden et  al., 1979). In contrast to the antimicrobial activity, none  of these four compounds dramatically increased the  cytotoxicity of anacardic acid (1). Their effect was only  additive. As an example, the combination study of  anacardic acid (1) with BHA by the checkerboard method  is shown in Figure 2.  The total yield of the antitumor anacardic acids (1-3)  in the freeze-dried cashew apple juice was reported at about  0.05% (Kubo et al., 1986). In addition to these anacardic  acids, the high content of vitamin C in the cashew apple  is described above (Cecchi and Rodriguez-Amaya, 1981).  Together with previous papers (Kubo et al., 1987; Itokawa  et al., 1987), these datasuggest that consuming the cahsew  apple and/or ita products continuously for long durations  may be advantageous in controlling tumors.
