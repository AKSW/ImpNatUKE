The structures of the isolated lignans were elucidated by interpretation of their spectroscopic data, including by gHMQC and gHMBC. The relative and abso- lute conﬁgurations of the isolates were determined from NOESY interactions and optical properties, respectively. Four of the lignans were diastereomeric whilst one was of mixed biosynthetic origin. All but one of the lignans exhibited high in vitro trypanocidal activity when assayed against epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi strain Y. � 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction Chagas disease is one of the most widespread of tropical diseases, being endemic in 21 countries, with some 16–18 million individuals infected and a further 100 million peo- ple at risk (Molfetta et al., 2005; Pozas et al., 2005). Signiﬁcant antiprotozoal activities have recently been reported for a number of lignans derived from members of the Piperaceae family (Martins et al., 2003; Luize et al., 2006). This family, which is included among the basal angiosperms and can be found in the tropics mainly as pio- neer plants, has been the subject of numerous phytochem- ical investigations. The major classes of compounds described include phenylpropanoids (Orjala et al., 1993), lignan/neolignans (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Par- mar et al., 1997; Benevides et al., 1999; Martins et al., 2003), pyrones (Singh, 1992), aliphatic and aromatic amides (Ale´cio et al., 1998; Navickiene et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2002), alkaloids (Dodson et al., 2000), polyketides (Cheng et al., 2003), benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005; Morandim et al., 2005) and chromenes (More- ira et al., 1998; Baldoqui et al., 1999; Lago et al., 2004; Morandim et al., 2005; Salazar et al., 2005). Piper and Peperomia represent the most important gen- era of the Piperaceae family with 2000 (Wanke et al., 2006) and 1700 species (Quijano-Abril et al., 2006), respectively. Species of Peperomia are well known as ornamental plants and have found application in folk medicine for the treat- ment of inﬂammation, asthma and gastric ulcers, and as analgesic and antibacterial agents (Arrigon-Blank et al., 2004). The major classes of compounds present in the rela- tively few species of Peperomia that have been investigated are prenylated phenols and benzoic acids (Monache and Compagnone, 1996; Seeram et al., 1998; Tanaka et al., 1998; Salazar et al., 2005), and also dibenzylbutyro- lactone and dibenzylbutanediol lignans (Li et al., 2006). 0031-9422/$ - see front matter � 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

More recently, two new tetrahydrofuran lignans were isolated from Peper- omia pellucida (Xu et al., 2006) and thus a phenylpropa- noid-based lineage for the Peperomia species can be supported. Peperomia blanda H.B. & K. is a perennial herb that typ- ically grows in wet rock crevices (Guimara˜es and Giord- ano, 2004). At the present time, information is only available concerning the essential oil (Santos et al., 2001) and two chromenes isolated from the non-polar fraction of the aerial parts of the species (Velozo et al., 2006). In the present work, we report the isolation and structural elu- cidation of four new tetrahydrofuran lignan stereoisomers and a new tetrahydrofuran lignan of mixed biosynthetic origin. The antitripanosomal properties of these novel lign- ans have been determined. 2. Results and discussion The EtOAc extract derived from aerial parts of P. blan- da was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 was fractionated chromatographically to yield ﬁve lignans 1–5; (Fig. 1) and two ﬂavones (6 and 7). The 1H NMR spectra of compounds 1–4 were characteristic of non-symmetric tetrahydrofuran lignans since each exhibited a pair of doublets at d 0.63 ± 0.05 (CH3-9) and 1.04 ± 0.04 (CH3-90) corresponding to methyl groups, a second set of doublets at d 5.03 ± 0.02 (H-7) and 4.32 ± 0.03 (H-70) that were assignable to oxybenzyl methine groups, and multiplets at d 2.18 ± 0.03 and 1.69 ± 0.03 associated, respectively, with the H8 and H80 protons. The 13C NMR spectroscopic data corroborated the presence of the tetrahydrofuran system in each case, and all signals were assigned accordingly based on HMBC data (Tables 1 and 2). As previously reported (Biftu and Stevenson, 1987; Barbosa-Filho et al., 1989), the coupling constants of 8.5 and 9.0 Hz for the doublet at d 5.05, and of 4.33 Hz for H-7 and H-70 indicate that these hydrogens are in a trans conﬁguration with the adjacent H-8 and H-80 in a tetrahy- drofuran ring. Diﬀerential NOE experiments (Fig. 2) con- ﬁrmed the relative stereochemistry of all of the lignans isolated. Thus, as for lignan 3, H-7 showed clear NOE cor- relations with H-70 and H-8, H-70 correlated with H-7, H-8 and H-90, and H-80 correlated with H-9 conﬁrming the trans conﬁguration of the adjacent H-8 and H-80 and a cis conﬁguration between H-7 and H-70. The diﬀerences observed in the NMR spectra of com- pounds 1–4 were due to diﬀerent substitution patterns in the aromatic ring. The molecular formula of lignan 1 was established as C22H26O7 by HRMS. The aromatic moieties were determined to be syringyl and 5-methoxy-3,4-methy- lenedioxyphenyl groups on the following basis: (i) two equivalent aromatic hydrogens at d 6.49 (s, 2H) correlated to H7 in the HMBC spectrum, (ii) aromatic carbons C3 and C5 displayed correlations to OCH3 (d 3.80) and to H2/H6, and (iii) the second aromatic ring was not symmet- rical and displayed two singlets at d 6.61 (H20) and 6.64 (H60), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-40 and C-70 in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, 1 was established as rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-4-hydroxy-40,50-methylenedioxy-3,5,30- trimethoxy-7,70-epoxylignan. Compound 2 showed a molecular formula of C23H28O7 by HRMS. 1H NMR spectra indicated two equivalent aro- matic hydrogens at d 6.48 (s, 2H) correlating to H7 in the HMBC spectrum and aromatic carbons C3, C5 at d 152.8 displayed correlations to OCH3 (d 3.77) and to H2/H6 and subsequently, C4 at d 136.6 displayed correlations to OCH3 (d 3.76). The second aromatic ring was not symmetrical and displayed two singlets at d 6.61 (H20) and 6.64 (H60), respectively, which showed cross peaks to C-40 and C-70 in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, 2 was identiﬁed as rel- (7R,8S,70S,80S)-40,50-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,30-tetrameth- oxy-7,70-epoxylignan, i.e., a methylated derivative of 1. The molecular formula of 3 was determined to be C23H30O7 by HRMS, and the aromatic moieties were iden- tiﬁed as 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl and 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimeth- oxyphenyl groups. The aromatic singlets at d 6.49 and 6.67 were assigned to separate aromatic groups, since the HMBC showed correlation to H7 (d 5.03) and H70 (d 4.34), respectively. The remaining correlations between C3/C30, C4/C40 and C5/C50 perfectly matched those of H2/H20and H6/H60. Thus compound 3 was determined as rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-40-hydroxy-3,4,5,30,50-pentameth- oxy-7,70-epoxylignan. Compound 4 showed the molecular formula C22H24O7 by HRMS, and both aromatic moieties were identiﬁed as 5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl groups for the sig- nals at d 5.97 (s, 2H) and d 5.96 (s, 2H) due to methylenedi- oxyphenyl groups connected to C4/C5 and C40/C50, respectively. At d 3.93 (s, 3H) and d 3.90 (s, 3H) are the res- onances of two methoxyl groups correlated to C3 and C30.

Tetrahydrofuran lignans isolated from the aerial parts of Peper- omia blanda. 446 L.G. Felippe et al. / Phytochemistry 69 (2008) 445–450 The identity of 4 was thus established as rel- (7R,8S,70S,80S)-4,5,40,50-dimethylenedioxy-3,30-dimethoxy- 7,70-epoxylignan. The molecular formula of 5 was established as C23H28O8 by HRMS. The compound diﬀered from lignans 1–4 in respect to a hydroxyl group linked to C-9. The presence of this group was deduced from various sources: the IR spectrum (absorption at 3450 cm�1), from the 1H NMR by signals at d 3.40 (2H, m), from the 13C NMR both from resonances at d 62.5 and the presence of only one methyl group (d 1.08; d, J = 7.0 Hz), and from the HMBC, which showed connectivity between the H9 protons and C7. Thus, 5 was determined as rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-9-hydroxy- 40,50-methylenedioxy-3,4,5,30-tetramethoxy-7,70- epoxylignan. The known ﬂavones 5-hydroxy-40,7,8-trimethoxyﬂavone (6) and 5-hydroxy-30,40,7,8-tetramethoxyﬂavone (7) were also identiﬁed in the extract derived from the aerial parts of P. blanda. These compounds have been previously iso- lated from Peperomia sui (Cheng et al., 2003). Compounds 1–5 were submitted to bioassay against epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi strain Y and the respective IC50 values are shown in Table 3. All of the lign- ans exhibited potent trypanocidal activity.

Concluding remarks In this work, we describe the isolation and structural elucidation of ﬁve new tetrahydrofuran lignans from the aerial part of P. blanda. The trypanocidal activity of these compounds was evaluated against epimastigotes of T. cruzi strain Y. All of the isolates showed potent activity when compared with the positive control benznidazole. 3. Experimental 3.1. General 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova-500 spectrometer at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as reference. HREIMS were measured using a Bruker Daltronics model ultrO- TOFQ ESI-TOF instrument. HPLC separations were per- formed on a Varian PrepStar model SD-1 LC/UV/VIS chromatograph equipped with a Supelcosil C-18 reversed phase column (250 · 21.2 mm; Supelco). IR spectra were measured in KBr pellets in a Perkin–Elmer Infrared spec- trometer FTIR series 1600. Optical rotations were mea- sured at k = 589 nm in a digital polarimeter JASCO model DIP-370. UV spectra were recorded in MeOH using a HP 8452 A spectrophotometer. Separations by CC were carried out using silica gel (230–400 mesh; Merck). All sol- vents were redistilled prior to use. 3.2. Plant material The aerial parts of P. blanda were collected at the Res- erva da Ripasa, Ibate´ – SP, Brazil in January of 2005 and identiﬁed by Dra. Elsie Franklin Guimara˜es. A vou- cher specimen (Kato-547) has been deposited at the Her- barium of the Instituto de Biocieˆncias, Universidade de Sa˜o Paulo, Sa˜o Paulo – SP, Brazil. 3.3. Isolation of compounds Dried aerial parts (86 g) of P. blanda were milled, extracted with EtOAc (1.2 L) for 4 hours at room temper- ature, and the extract was concentrated in vacuo to yield a crude extract (8.5 g). This extract was resuspended in MeOH:H2O (4:1) and partitioned against hexane, CH2Cl2 and EtOAc. The portion soluble in CH2Cl2 (1.95 g) was submitted to CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane–EtOAc to yield fractions 1-14. The precipitate pres- ent in fraction 3 (420 mg) was puriﬁed by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield compound 6 (6.3 mg), whilst the soluble part was submitted to ﬂash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane–EtOAc producing subfractions 3-1 to 3- 60. Subfractions 3-20 (12 mg) and 3-43 (46 mg) aﬀorded compounds 4 and 2, respectively. Fraction 4 (220 mg) was submitted to ﬂash CC over silica gel eluted with a gra- dient of hexane–EtOAc providing subfractions 4-1 to 4-37. Subfraction 4-23 (98 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (72:28) to aﬀord compound 1 (8.6 mg). The precipitate present in fraction 6 (103 mg) was puriﬁed by recrystallisation in MeOH to yield com- pound 7 (8.0 mg). Fraction 7 (350 mg) was subjected to ﬂash CC over silica gel eluted with a gradient of hexane– EtOAc resulting in subfractions 7-1 to 7-167. Subfraction 7-140 aﬀorded compound 5 (7 mg). Subfraction 7-79 (95.0 mg) was submitted to preparative HPLC eluted with MeOH:H2O (2:3) to yield ﬁve fractions, the penultimate of which aﬀorded compound 3 (17 mg). 3.4. rel-(7R,8S,70S,80S)-4-Hydroxy-40,50-methylenedioxy- 3,5,30-trimethoxy-7,70-epoxylignan (1) Pale yellow oil, ½a�21 D �52.8 (MeOH; c 0.125).

Tetrahydrofuran lignans and benznidazole (Roche, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were stored as 1.0 mg ml�1 stock solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and were serially diluted (1:3) prior to use with liver-infusion tryptose (LIT) medium to provide concentra- tions of 0.41, 1.23, 3.70, 11.1, 33.3, 100.0 and 300.0 lg ml�1, each in triplicate. The number of viable pro- tozoa was determined by counting in a Neubauer chamber after 72 h incubation at 28 �C. The 50% inhibitory concen- tration (IC50) values were calculated by ﬁtting a nonlinear regression curve (sigmoidal dose response, variable slope) and comparing with those of benznidazole, the positive control. A one-way ANOVA test was used to establish the signiﬁcance level of the activity corresponding to each compound evaluated in the in vitro assay.
