Abstract--The fruit and stem of DicWoloma vandellianum have yielded three limonoids and a mixture of two alkaloids. The  limonoids were identified as deacetylspathelin and the corresponding 21- and 23-'y-hydrexybutenolide derivatives. The  limonoids were isolated from the fruits and stem, while the alkaloids were found only in the stem. These results provide firm  support for including the genus Dictyoloma in the Rutaceae,  Introduction  Dictyoloma Juss. contains only two species, D.  vandellianum Adr. Juss. (syn. D. incanescens  DC) which occurs in Brazil and D, peruvianum  which occurs in Peru [1-3].  The taxonomy of this genus has been  doubtful since its initial description in 1825,  when Jussieu [4] classified it in the Rutaceae,  assigning it to the tribe Zanthoxyleae. However,  at the same time De Candolle [5] classified it as  an ill-defined genus in the Terebinthaceae  "ordo" (equivalent to the modern description of  the Terebinthaceae).  According to the concept of Bentham and  Hooker [6], Dictyoloma belongs to the Simarou-  baceae "ordo". Engler [1] first included Dictyo-  Ioma in the Simaroubaceae, but later removed it  to the Rutaceae, classifying Dictyoloma as the  single genus in the subfamily Dictyolomatoideae  [2].  One simple amine [7] and two chromones  [8, 9] have previously been isolated from  Dictyoloma. In this paper we report a phyto-  chemical study on D. vandellianurn, which grows  in S~o Paulo state, Brazil and discuss its  chemotaxonomic position in the Rutales in the  light of our findings.  Results and Discussion  Isolabon and identificabon of compounds  The chloroform extract of the fruits yielded, on  chromatography over silica gel, three limonoids,  (Received 22 January 1988)  541  sitosterol and triglycerides. The corresponding  extract from the stems yielded the same  limonoids and two alkaloids.  The major limonoid was identified as de-  acethylspathelin (1) and was transformed into  spathelin  (la)  when  treated  with  acetic  anhydride and pyridine. The 1H NMR spectra of  1 and la were obtained (Table 1) and revealed  the anticipated chemical shifts and coupling  constants. Of particular note was the upfield  shift of 0.35 ppm for H-15 on acetylation, which  suggests that H-15 has a cis relationship with  H-7 [10, 11].  Treatment of I with a basic solution of NaOH  gave the acid 2 which upon reaction with  diazomethane,  yielded  the  corresponding  methyl ester 2a. The structure of 2a was  established by 1H NMR (Table 1), the doublet for  H-1 in 1 being replaced by a triplet observed at ~)  3.90. A similar result was obtained by Taylor [12]  when spathelin was treated under the same  conditions, but the product reported by Taylor  was epimeric at C-1.  Treatment of 1 under acidic conditions using  TsOH with MeOH as solvent, gave an interesting  product characterized as the ortho ester 3. The  comparison of the 1H NMR spectra obtained for  1 and 3 (Table 1) shows a shielding of the pair of  doublets observed for H-1 and H-2 indicating the  absence of an 0~,J]-unsaturated ester unit.  Similarly there is an upfield shift shown for the  methoxy protons. In the IR spectrum of 3 there  are only two bands in the carbonyl region at  1740 and 1720 cm -~. When 3 was submitted to  catalytic hydrogenation, there was reduction of  542  PAULO C. VIEIRA, ANA R. L~_.ARO, JO,~,O B. FERNANDES AND M. F,&,TIMA DAS G. F.

The 13C NMR, when compared with the data  obtained for 1, proved to be useful in the total  characterization of 3. Resonances at 160.8, 118.8  and 166.0 in 1 are attributed to C-1, C-2 and C-3,  respectively, while in 3, these signals are  replaced by resonances at 127.0, 134.8 and  114.7, of which the last represents the ortho  ester carbon.  Two further limonoids 4 and 5 were isolated.  Their spectral characteristics were close to those  of 1 (Table 1). The principal change observed in  the 1H NMR of 4 and 5 was the absence of the  furan unit, which was substituted by a ~'-  hydroxybutyrolactone. For compound 4 this unit  is characterized by the signals in the 1H NMR at  ~ 7.41 referring to H-22 and ~ 6.10 for H-23.  However for 5 there is a signal at ~ 6.02, instead  of ~ 7.41.  The analysis of the mass spectrum of 4 and 5  reveals an increment of 32 MU in relation to 1,  suggesting the presence of two more oxygen  atoms, which confirms their hydroxy-butenolide  nature. When 4 and 5 were acetylated, the  product obtained exhibited two different signals  for the acetyl groups, indicating two hydroxy  groups in the starting compounds 4 and 5. This  fact is definitive proof that one hydroxy group is  located at C-7 and the other at the butyrolactone  moiety.  The transformation of 1 into a mixture of 4  and 5 was carried out by means of a photo-  oxidation reaction.  The alkaloids 4,7,8-trimethoxy-l-methyl-2-  quinolone (6) and casimiroine (7), previously  isolated from two species of Rutaceae, Spathelia  sorbifolia [13] and Casimiroa edulis [14], respec-  tively, were characterized by the co-identity of  spectral and physical data with that published.  Conclusion  The alkaloids and limonoids that we have iso-  lated from D. vandellianum are typical of the  Rutaceae family [15, 16], while the two chro-  mones 8 and 9 described recently for the same  species are know to occur sporadically in the  Rutaceae and allied families [17]. All these  compounds are particularly closely related to  those isolated from S. sorbifolia, and this is  evidence of the chemical affinity between the  subfamilies Spathelioideae and Dictyolomatoi-  deae.  Spathelioideae is a small subfamily of the  Rutaceae [2] and it was also previously placed in  the Simaroubaceae [6]. However, the presence  of limonoids and anthranilic acid derivatives  alkaloids (specifically 6) was the reason used by  Adams [18] to retain Spathelioideae in the  Rutaceae.  Based on the above evidence, we are sug-  gesting that D. vandellianum certainly belongs to  the Rutaceae, which is in agreement with the  most recent proposition of Engler [2].
