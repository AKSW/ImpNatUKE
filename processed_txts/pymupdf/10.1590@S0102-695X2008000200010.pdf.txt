ABSTRACT: Since the methanol extract of Lantana lilacina leaves collected in the city of Lavras  (MG, Brazil) showed antibacterial properties in a preliminary study, a fractionation process guided  by agar diffusion assays with Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Staphylococcus aureus was carried out to purify and identify the active compounds. After  solvent partition and several chromatographic steps, [β-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-(3’-O-α-L- rhamnopyranosyl)-(4’-O-cafeoyl)-β-D-glycopyranoside, known as acteoside, was isolated. The  minimal inhibition concentration and the minimal bactericidal concentration of such substance  against A. hydrophila, B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were 0.12, 1.00, 1.00 and 0.25 mg/ mL, respectively. Keywords: Lantana lilacina, Verbenaceae, antibacterial activity, acteoside. INTRODUCTION Although  pharmaceutical  industries  have  produced a large number of new antimicrobial agents,  the emergence of resistant bacterial strains has become  a public health problem all over the world. In the United  States of America, for instance, each year, 70% of the two  million cases of bacterial infections acquired in hospitals  consist of strains resistant to at least one antibacterial  compound (Alexandria, 2004). Moreover, adverse effects  and the high cost of the antimicrobial substances make  the search for new effective drugs extremely necessary.  As the biological activity of plants has been  known since antiquity (Rios and Recio, 2005), a  preliminary evaluation of local plant extracts was carried  out to identify those with antimicrobial properties  (Oliveira et al., 2007). During such study, a pronounced  in vitro antibacterial property was observed for the aerial  parts of Lantana lilacina Desf. (Verbenaceae), a 50-120  cm height native Brazilian shrub, which produces pink  or purple ﬂ owers. Known as a weed and an ornamental  plant (Lorenzi, 2000), it has been used in the traditional  medicine to treat cold and bronchitis (Balbach, 1986).  Although several substances have been identiﬁ ed in  other species of the Lantana genus (Begum et al., 2000;  Siddiqui et al., 1995; Barbosa-Filho et al., 2006), only  monoterpene glucoside esters were isolated from L.  lilacina leaves (Dembitsky, 2004). No further studies  concerning the chemical composition of this plant species  have been found. Therefore, this research was aimed to  purify and identify the antibacterial compounds present  in the methanol extract of L. lilacina leaves. MATERIAL AND METHODS 205 Puriﬁ cation of an antibacterial compound from Lantana lilacina Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 18(2): Abr./Jun. 2008 Plant material Leaves  from  Lantana  lilacina  Desf.  (Verbenaceae) were collected in the city of Lavras,  State of Minas Gerais (Brazil). Voucher specimens were  identiﬁ ed by Prof. Valéria E. G. Rodrigues and deposited  in the Herbarium ESAL (ESAL 15.172), at Universidade  Federal de Lavras, Lavras.  General experimental procedures All reagents used were of recognized analytical  grade. Acetic acid, acetonitrile, and methanol were  HPLC-grade (Vetec, Brazil). During the puriﬁ cation  steps, solvent concentration was carried out in a rotatory  evaporator at 35 ºC, followed by 24 h in a freeze-drier.  Except when mentioned otherwise, all fractions were  submitted to antibacterial diffusion assays to direct  puriﬁ cation. Column chromatography was carried  out on silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh, Merck). Mass  spectra were obtained on an Agilent 1100 LC/MS Trap  equipped with an electrospray interface. Samples (1.0  mg) were dissolved in MeOH (1.0 mL) and 20 μL were  directly injected into the interface at a ﬂ ow rate of 5 μL/ min. Deuterated dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO-d6) and  deuterated methanol (CD3OD) were used as solvents for  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses performed  on a Varian Unit 500 instrument  using solvent peak as  reference. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained in both  solvents, while HMBC, HMQC and TOCSY analyses  were carried out only in DMSO-d6.  Extraction and isolation Fresh leaves of L. lilacina were exhaustively  extracted with methanol at room temperature. Part of  the crude extract (0.5 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of  an ethanol:H2O (7:3; v/v) solution and submitted to  the antibacterial diffusion assay. Another part (0.5 mg)  of such extract was dissolved in 0.5 mL of an aqueous  1% (g/mL) Tween 80 solution and used in the broth  microdilution assay.  The crude extract (10.0 g) was subsequently  washed with hexane (10 x 100 mL), ethyl acetate (AcOEt;  10 x 100 mL) and methanol (MeOH; 10 x 100 mL). Part  (3.5 g) of the MeOH fraction (M1) was successively  eluted with MeOH, H2O and HCl 0.1 M through a silica  gel column (4 x 15 cm). Part (1.8 g) of the resulting  MeOH fraction (M2) was eluted with MeOH through a  C-18 column (1 x 5 cm), yielding fraction M3 (1.0 g).  Then, M3 was fractionated on a C-18 column (Luna  C-18, 200 x 21.2 mm, 10 μM, Phenomenex, USA),  using aqueous 0.1% acetic acid solution:MeOH (5%  MeOH during 5 min, 5-100% MeOH during 60 min,  100% MeOH for 21 min), at a ﬂ ow rate of 30 mL/min, as  eluent.  An UV detector set at 254 nm was employed to  monitor the fractionation. One of the resulting fractions  (F11; 169 mg; eluted between 18-19 min) was puriﬁ ed  on the same column employing aqueous 0.1% acetic acid  solution:MeOH (62:38) as eluent, at a ﬂ ow rate of 20 mL/ min. In this case the UV detector was set at 320 nm. This  procedure yielded fraction 6 as a pure compound (F6; 15  mg; eluted between 10.2-12.5 min), which was identiﬁ ed  as acteoside (Figure 1) by NMR and mass spectrometry  analyses. Antibacterial assays Antibacterial activity was evaluated with four  standard bacterial strains acquired from the American  Type of Culture Collection (ATCC, USA): Bacillus  subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC  25923 (Gram-positive), Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC  7966 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (Gram- negative). Agar diffusion assays (NCCLS, 2003a) were  carried out in duplicates. Brieﬂ y, after bacterial growth  in triptic soy agar (TSA, Acumedia, USA) during 24 h  at 37 ºC, the resulting cultures were used to prepare cell  suspensions in an aqueous 0.85% (g/mL) NaCl solution,  at 0.5 turbidity according to MacFarland scale. Such  suspensions were inoculated with a swab on the surface  of Mueller-Hinton agar (Merck, Germany) Petri dishes  and 40 μL of each sample were deposited into 6 mm  diameter holes made on the inoculated medium. After 24  h at 37 ºC, samples causing 7 mm or larger inhibition  zone diameters around the holes were considered active. Minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal  concentrations (MIC and MBC) were determined by a  broth microdilution assay (NCCLS, 2003b). A twofold  serial dilution of the reference (chloramphenicol  succinate: Sigma, USA; 400 μg/mL) and samples were  prepared using Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB: Biolife,  Italy) supplemented with calcium and magnesium cations  (Alderman and Smith, 2001). The crude extract was  dissolved in an aqueous 1% (g/mL) Tween 80 solution  at a concentration of 10 mg/mL and ﬁ ltered through a  0.22 μm membrane (GV Durapore PVDF, Milipore,  USA). 7.5 x 104 CFU were poured into each well and the  initial extract concentration was 5.0 mg/mL. Aqueous 1%  Tween 80 and chloramphenicol solutions were employed  as negative and positive control, respectively. After 24  h at 37 oC, 10 μL were withdrawn from each well with  no bacterial growth and subcultured in TSA during  24 h at the same temperature. MIC was considered the  lowest concentration of the extract that prevented visible  growth in the well during 24 h and MBC was deﬁ ned  as the lowest concentration yielding negative subcultures  during 24 h. The isolated compound (acteoside, Figure 1)  was also submitted to a broth microdilution assay. It (2  mg) was dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO (P.A.) and diluted  with MHB. The highest acteoside’s concentration in the  well was 1.0 mg/mL. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 206 Aline C. Pereira, Hudson W. P. Carvalho,  Geraldo H. Silva,  et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J.

During all puriﬁ cation steps, only one active  fraction was observed. Consequently, it seems that the  antibacterial property of the crude extract was due only  to the isolated substance, which amounted to 15 mg of a  hygroscopic viscous oil that could get dark easily when  exposed to light and air. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Table  2), obtained in DMSO-d6, it was clear that most signals  belonged to groups linked to heteroatoms (2.7-5.0 ppm) or  unsaturated carbons (6.2-7.5 ppm). Such result suggested  aromatic rings linked to carbohydrate units. The 13C  NMR spectrum (Table 2) pointed to the same direction,  since most signals were in the carbon sp3-heteroatom and  carbon sp2 regions. Signals at 140 and 150 ppm suggested  carbon sp2 - heteroatom groups, while the one at 165  ppm seemed due to a carbonyl group, probably an ester  (Silverstein and Webster, 1998; Pretsch et al., 1989).

It is worth to  mention that the stereochemistry of the caffeoyl moiety  was clear in the 1H spectrum, since the coupling constant  (J) between H7 and H8 was 16 Hz, which is characteristic  of a trans arrangement (Silverstein and Webster, 1998) Although the spectra obtained in DMSO-d6 were  in accordance with NMR data reported for the acteoside  dissolved in the same solvent (Tanaka et al., 2004),  CD3OD was also used, since it could afford a simpler 1H  NMR spectrum. As a consequence, the α-L-rhamnose  moiety with OR (linked to C1’’’) and OH (linked to C2’’’)  in the axial positions was conﬁ rmed by the low J between  H1’’’ and H2’’’ (J = 1.5 Hz, equatorial-equatorial). In the  β-D-glucose unit, the trans-diaxial couplings (6.0 - 9.3  Hz) became clear for all hydrogen atoms linked to the  ring. Moreover, NMR spectra obtained in CD3OD were  totally in agreement with the ﬁ ndings of Wu et al. (2004)  and Owen et al. (2003) for the acteoside. The mass spectrometry analysis of the isolated  compound in the negative mode showed peaks at m/z 623  [M-H]− and 659 [M+Cl]−. Experiments inducing m/z 623  to fragmentation resulted in m/z 461 [M-H-162]− (MS2)  and m/z 315 [M-H-162-146]− (MS3), corresponding to  caffeoyl and rhamnose units loss, respectively. In the  positive mode, as observed by Plaza et al. (2005), peaks  were detected at m/z 647 [M+Na]+ and 501 [M+Na-146]+  (MS2), which was due to the rhamnose unit loss. Once there was no doubt that the isolated  compound was the acteoside, a microdilution assay  was carried out to evaluate its antimicrobial activity.  Speciﬁ cally with A. hydrophila and S. aureus, MIC and  MBC values were very close to those obtained with  chloramphenicol (Table 3). These results are in agreement  with those reported by Didry et al (1999), who observed  Proteus mirabilis and S. aureus growth inhibition by the  acteoside at 0.128 mg/mL, during an agar dilution assay.  Similarly, Lima et al. (2003) observed that a mixture of  acteoside and isoacteoside showed MIC of 0.6 mg/mL  against S. aureus and B. subtilis. According to Avila et  al. (1999), acteoside inhibits S. aureus leucine admission,  which stops protein synthesis and kills such bacterium.  Unfortunately, P. aeruginosa, a bacterium resistant  to several drugs (Barros, 2001), was able to grow in  the presence of L. lilacina  crude  extract. Moreover,  acteoside’s MIC and MBC against this microorganism  were both 1 mg/mL, which is a high value when compared  to other substances (Ng et al., 1996; Ogundipe et al.,  2001; Lima et al., 2003). It is worth to mention that other biological  activities have also been attributed to acteoside: protein  kinase C inhibitor (Herbert et al.,1991); antitumor and  immunosuppressive (Zhang et al., 2002; Ohno et al.,  2002); antioxidant (Ono et al., 2005; Owen et al., 2003;  Aligiannia et al., 2003); and antiinﬂ ammatory (Diaz et  al., 2004). In conclusion, for the ﬁ rst time it is shown that  the antibacterial activity of L. lilacina leaves methanol  extract is due to the presence of acteoside, a compound  largely distributed in the plant kingdom. As observed in  this study and by other research groups, such substance  should be better evaluated by pharmacological and  chemical assays aiming at the pharmaceutical use, either  in humans or animals.
