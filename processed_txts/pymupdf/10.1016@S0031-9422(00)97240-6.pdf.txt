LINS MESQUITA and T. J. NAGEM  Instituto de Cienclas Exatas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerals, Belo Horizonte, Brasil  (Received 20 October 1970)  Abstract-Kielmeyera  rubriflora Camb.  contains 2_hydroxyxanthone,  2,4-dimethoxy-3-hydroxyxanthone ,  2,3-dimethoxy-4_hydroxyxanthone,  4-hydroxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone,  4-methoxy-2,3-methylenedi-  oxyxanthone  and 1,7-dimethoxy-2,3,&trihydroxyxanthone  (Ia).  WOOD and bark of the tree Kielmeyera rubrijlora Camb. (Guttiferae) were collected in the  SCrro region, Minas Gerals State, Brasil. The benzene extract of the wood yielded 2-  hydroxyxanthone,‘*2  2,4-dimethoxy-3-hydroxyxanthone,2  2,3-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyxan-  thone,2-s  4-hydroxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone,  2,3 4-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxan-  thone,3*s kie1corin4 and /3-sitosterol. All the xanthones had been isolated previously from  other Kielmeyera species and were identified by direct comparison with authentic samples.  The benzene extract of the bark yielded, besides aliphatic material, a new compound.  Its molecular weight, determined by mass spectrometry, was consistent with the constitution  of a dimethoxytrihydroxyxanthone.  The PMR-spectrum  confirmed the existence of two  methoxyls and of three aromatic protons. One proton was represented by a singlet at 3.55~  and must, consequently, be placed at the 2-, 3- or 4-position of a trioxygenated ring. The  remaining two protons were represented by doublets at 2.67 7 (.I 9-O Hz) and 3.43 7 (9-O Hz)  and must, consequently, be placed at the 5,6 or 6,7-positions of the dioxygenated ring. All  signals were sufficiently up-field to preclude the existence of a proton at a peri (1,8)-position  of either ring.6  One of these peri-positions is occupied by a hydroxyl, as shown by the shift of the UV  absorption maxima upon addition of AlCl, + HCl. The second peri-position, however, is  occupied by a methoxyl, since the compound reacted speedily with diazomethane to form  a monohydroxy-tetramethoxyxanthone  (and not a dihydroxy-trimethoxyxanthone).  The  mass spectrum of this derivative contained a peak corresponding to M-l 5-l 8 a.m.u. Loss of  the elements of water upon electron impact again suggested the presence of a methoxy-group  adjacent to the carbonyl.7  * Part XXVII  in the series “The Chemistry of Brazdian Guttiferae”.

Clearly,  these hydroxyls  cannot  be situated  at positions  adjoinmg  the peri-hydroxyl.  Three vicinal  hydroxy  groups  are incompatible  with the relatively  high stabihty  of the compound  in  presence  of alkali. They have, consequently,  to be placed either at C-2,C-3 adjoinmg  the  peri-methoxyl,  or at C-3,C-4.  The latter  alternative,  however,  cannot  be correct,  smce It  also would impart  instablhty  to a xanthone  in alkaline  medium.8  Thus, the peri-hydroxyl  with the unsubstituted  para-posltion  is located  in the dlsubstituted  ring. In view of the  vicinity  of the hydrogens  on this ring, the remaming  methoxyl  and the peri-hydroxyl  must  be o&o-related.  This leads to the constitution  of 1,7-dimethoxy-2.3,8-trihydroxyxanthone  (Ia) for the new compound.  The 1,2,3,7,%pentaoxygenation  pattern  has not been reported  previously  for a natural  xanthone.  EXPERIMENTAL  For experimental techniques see Ref. 5. The identification  of all previously described substances  was  confirmed by direct comparison  (co-chromatography,  mixed m.ps and IR spectra) with authentic samples.
