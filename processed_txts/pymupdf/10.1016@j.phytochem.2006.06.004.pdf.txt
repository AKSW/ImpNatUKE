Introduction Endophytic fungi are organisms living within the tissues of hosts plants (Andrews and Hirano, 1991). These organ- isms are known as potential sources of biologically active secondary metabolites (Dreyfuss and Chapela, 1994; Tan and Zou, 2001; Strobel et al., 2004) and relatively little is known about the potential of these microorganisms from Brazilian endemic plant species (Azevedo et al., 2000, 2004). As part of our studies on bioactive agents from metabo- lites produced by endophytic fungi associated with species of native plants from the Brazilian Cerrado, we initially selected 16 species of plants, which had already been phy- tochemically proﬁled by our group. Those species were submitted for isolation of endophytic fungi and 82 pure isolates were obtained, preserved, cultivated in liquid media and extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain crude extracts. Some metabolites produced by fungi were already published by our group (Teles et al., 2005; Cafeˆu et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2005). The crude EtOAc extract of Phomopsis cassiae isolated from Cassia spectabilis showed moderate antifungal activ- ity against Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Cladospo- rium cladosporioides, stimulating further studies. Bioassay guided fractionation of this extract aﬀorded ﬁve new ses- quiterpenes (1–5). 0031-9422/$ - see front matter � 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and discussion Compound 1 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular for- mula C15H22O3 ([M + Na]+ at m/z 273.1486). Their IR spectra revealed the presence of hydroxyl (3410 cm�1) and phenolic groups (1466, 1690 cm�1). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 (Table 1) showed two aromatic signals, one at d 6.87 (1H, s) and the other at d 6.43 (1H, s), sug- gesting a tetra-substituted aromatic spin-system with a para conﬁguration. A series of complex signals at d 3.76 (1H, m) 3.35 (4H, m); d 3.04 (1H, m) and d 2.30 (1H, m) were indicative of two carbinolic and two benzyl hydrogens, respectively. Further signals at d 0.51 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), d 1.03 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), d 2.05 (3H, s) revealed the presence of two aliphatic and one aromatic methyl groups in the molecule. The 13C NMR chemical shifts for 1 along with the infor- mation obtained from a DEPT-135 experiment (Table 1), indicated a total of 15 signals, suggesting a sesquiterpene: six aromatic carbons at d 152.9 (s), 141.1 (s), 128.1 (d), 127.4 (s), 121.9 (s) and 114.7 (d), conﬁrming the tetra-sub- stitution for the aromatic moiety and the para hydrogen system; two carbinolic signals: a methine at d 67.8 and a methylene at d 64.4; three signals for methines at d 40.1, 38.4 and 36.5; one aliphatic methylene at d 24.6 and three signals for methyl groups: d 16.7, 15.9 and 10.8. The above data suggested a cadinane skeleton (Zhang et al., 1998; Nagashima et al., 1996). The total attribution for the observed signals was accomplished based on gHMQC correlations. Additional gHMBC correlations of H-5 (d 6.87) with C- 15 and C-7 (d 15.9 and d 36.5, respectively) and H-2 (d 6.43) with C-10 and C-4 (d 40.1 and d 121.9) allowed us to fully determine the aromatic moiety. The phenolic func- tion linked at C-3, was supported by the correlations between H-15 (d 2.05) and C-3/C-5 (d 152.9 and d 128.1, respectively). The linkage of the p-menthane moiety was determined through the correlations shown by C-1 (d 141.1) with H-14/H-9 (d 1.03/d 3.76) and C-6 (d 127.4) with, H-11/H-8b (d 2.70/d 1.52). Observed correlations between C-12 ! H-7 (d 64.4/3.04) and H-13 ! C-7 (d 0.51/36.5) allowed us to fully determine the calamenene skeleton (Nagashima et al., 1996). gNOESY was useful to establish the relative conﬁgura- tion of the stereocenters for 1. A correlations between Me-14 and Me-13 conﬁrmed a cis-calamenene, according to reported literature (Croft et al., 1978; Anderson et al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993). Further observed corre- lations between H-9a and H-7 allowed us to conﬁrm a (cis)-1,3-pseudo-diaxial relationship between these centers (Nabeta et al., 1993). We were not able to determine the conﬁguration of the stereocenter at C-11, due to free rotation of this center with C-7–C-11 bond. Compound 1 was thus identiﬁed as the rel. (�)-(7S,9S,10S)-3,9,12- trihydroxycalamenene. Compound 2 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H22O3 ([M + H�H2O]+) at m/z 233.1542. The obtained mass and similarities observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 1) indicated that 2 was a diastereoisomer of 1. The main spectroscopic diﬀerences observed for this molecule were elucidated by using gNOESY. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 indicated that both groups remained in a cis conformation. The appearance of a strong correlation of Me-14 and H-9 indicated that H-7 and H-9 were in a trans conformation.

Assignments were aided by 1H–1H gCOSY and gHMQC. G.H. Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 1964–1969 1965 et al., 1972; Nabeta et al., 1993) allowed us to provisionally deduce identify 2 as rel. (+)-(7S,9R,10S) the C-9 diastereo- isomer of 1. Compound 3 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der. HRESI mass data allowed us to propose the molecular formula C15H22O2 ([M + H]+ at m/z 235.1777). The absence of an oxygen atom in this molecule allowed us to provisionally deduce that a reduction occurred at position C-9. This reduction was conﬁrmed by 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) due to the presence of the signal at d 28.5 and the lack of the carboxymethine signal at d 67.8/69.1 present in 1 and 2, respectively. A correlation between Me-14 and Me-13 was observed in the gNOESY experiment thus concluding that 3 has a cis calamenene relative stereochemistry. Observed correla- tions between H-9a and H-8a and H-7 deﬁned their relative conﬁguration also as cis. Further observed correlations between H-8b and H-9b, conﬁrmed the relative conﬁgura- tion established for the p-menthane moiety. Compound 3 was hence identiﬁed as the rel. (+)-(7S,10S) 3,12- dihydroxycalamenene. Compound 4 was isolated as a white amorphous pow- der. A molecular formula C15H18O2 ([M + H]+ at m/z 231.1405) was obtained after HRESI mass data analysis. The 1H NMR data (Table 1) showed a new aromatic hydrogen spin system at d 7.03 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) and d 6.93 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz) with an ortho conﬁguration. The downﬁeld shift observed for Me-14 (�Dd +1.3) was indic- ative of an aromatization of the p-menthane moiety (Nab- eta et al., 1994). 13C NMR and DEPT-135 (Table 1) data showed 10 aromatic carbons, three methyls: two benzylic and one aliphatic; one carboxymethylene and one benzylic methine, indicative of the presence of a naphthalene skele- ton. All correlations were determined using gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, and compared with reported data for cadalene analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975). Further correlations observed in the gHMBC experi- ment, particularly the ones of H-8 (d 6.93) with C-6/C-11 and H-9 (d 7.03) with C-1/C-14 allowed us to fully deter- mine the substitution pattern of the B ring for the naphtha- lene moiety. Compound 4 was identiﬁed as 3,12- dihydroxycadalene. Compound 5 was isolated as a white amorphous powder and its HRESI mass data suggested the molecular formula C15H18O3 ([M + Na]+ at m/z 269.1179). The appearance of a hydroxyl group in 5 was corroborated by the loss of the signal assigned to H-11 (d 3.59) in 4 thus suggesting that oxidation had occurred at this position. 13C NMR and DEPT-135 spectroscopic data corroborated this assump- tion showing a signal at d 75.3 (s) which exhibited a corre- lation showed in the gHMBC experiment with H-8 (d 7.21) indicating that the new oxidized position was at C-11. Other correlations were determined using gCOSY, gHMQC, and compared with reported data for analogues (Kubo et al., 1996; Nabeta et al., 1994; Stipanovic et al., 1975). Compound 5 was identiﬁed as the new 3,11,12- trihydroxycadalene. The antifungal activity of compounds 1–5 against the phytopathogenic fungi C. cladosporioides and C. sphaero- spermum was evaluated by bioautography (Rahalison et al., 1991). The compound 3,12-dihydroxycadalene (2) exhibited potent activity against two fungi. The detection limit for the compound 5 was found to be 1.0 lg, compara- ble with the same amount of the standard nystatin. Cytotoxicity of the compounds 1–5 against human cervical tumor cell line (HeLa) were tested using the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983).

Cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent, was used as positive control with IC50 5 lmol L�1. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedure Optical rotations were determined at room temperature using Perkin–Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR and UV spectra were recorded on Perkin–Elmer 1710 spectrometer and Perkin–Elmer UV–Vis 14P spectrometer. Melting points were measured on Microquimica MQAPF-301. 1H and 13C NMR spectra; gHMBC and gHMQC, gCOSY and TOCSY experiments were recorded on a Varian Unity 500 NMR, with TMS as internal standard. Electrospray mass and tandem mass spectra in both positive and nega- tive ion modes were recorded on a Q-Tof (Micromass) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) and high-reso- lution orthogonal time of ﬂight (o-TOF) conﬁguration. The sample introduction was performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Pump 11) set to 10 ll/min pumped through an uncoated fused-silica capillary. All samples were dissolved in MeOH–H2O (1:1). The HRESI-MS mass spectra were acquired using a ESI capil- lary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of 10 V. ESI-MS/ MS spectra of mass selected ions were acquired using 10– 20 eV collisions with argon. For preparative HPLC separa- tions, Varian Star Dynamax model SD-1 pump, and a Phe- nyl-hexyl Luna Phenomenex column, (250 · 21.20 mm, 5 lm), were used in this study. Peaks were detected using Varian model 320-chromato-integrator connected to a UV detector. TLC analysis was carried out on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Spots were visualized spraying anisal- dehyde 5% in H2SO4 followed by heating. 3.2. Plant material Authenticated C. spectabilis plant material was collected in the Chemistry Institute UNESP – Araraquara, SP, Bra- zil in June 17, 2001 by G.H. Silva. The botanical identiﬁca- tion was made by Professor Maria Cla´udia Marx Young and a voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden of Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil (Voucher No SILVA – 193). 3.3. Isolation of the endophytic fungus The fungal strain P. cassiae was an endophyte isolated from leaves of C. spectabilis. The leaves were washed in running H2O and surface sterilized by successive soaking in NaOCl 1% for 5 min, 70% EtOH for 1 min and then rinsed twice with water. Aseptically the leaves were cut open and 1 · 1 cm2 pieces of the leaves were placed on water agar in Petri plates. After incubation at 25 �C for seven days, individual hyphal tips of the emerging fungi were removed and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Maier et al., 1997). During the ﬁrst three weeks of incubation, the cultures were periodically checked for purity and successively subcultured by hyphal tipping method until pure culture was obtained. Cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar. The taxonomic iden- tiﬁcation as P. cassiae was performed based on fungal morphology by Ludwig H. Pfenning and deposited Cole- c¸a˜o Micologica de Lavras, Universidade Federal de Lav- ras fungal herbarium and assigned as CML 292. 3.4. Growth of P. cassiae and production of the EtOAc extract The fungus was cultivated on a small scale in 2 Erlen- meyer ﬂasks (500 mL), each containing 0.8 g of potato extract, 4.0 g dextrose and 200 mL distilled water (PDB) which were autoclaved at 125 �C for 15 min. Approxi- mately 10 small pieces (1 · 1 cm) of PDA medium, from the Petri dish containing biomass of the P. cassiae isolated were inoculated into each ﬂask and the ﬂasks were sealed with cotton to permit aerobic growth. After incubation for 28 days at 25 �C on rotary shakers at 150 rpm, the mycelia biomass accumulated in the ﬂasks was separated from the aqueous medium by ﬁltration. The culture broth was extracted with EtOAc (3 · 2,0 L). The EtOAc extracts were combined, ﬁltered, and evaporated in vacuo to give a yellow oil (277.12 mg). 3.5. Antifungal assay The microorganisms C. cladosporioides (Fresen) de Vries SPC 140 and C. sphaerospermum (Perzig) SPC 491 were used in the antifungal assay. They have been maintained at the Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil. Com- pounds 1–5 were applied on a precoated Si-gel TLC plates using a solution (10 lL) containing 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1 lg. After eluting with CHCl3:CH3OH (9:1) they were sprayed with the fungi (Rahalison et al., 1991). Nystatin was employed as positive control. 3.6. Cytotoxicity bioassays The human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) assay was performed as previously described (Mosmann, 1983). Cisplatin was used as positive control (IC50 5.0 lmol L�1). 3.7. Extraction and isolation The extract was subjected to C18 column chromatogra- phy employing gradient elution from H2O to MeOH, to yield 7 fractions (H2O:MeOH, 85:15, 65:35, 60:40, 55:45, 45:55, 35:65, 00:100 each 150 mL). 1H NMR spectro- scopic analyses identiﬁed fractions 3, 4 and 5 as promising G.H. Silva et al. / Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 1964–1969 1967 for further fractionation. The fraction 3 (23.0 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phenomenex 21.20 · 250 mm; using CH3CN:H2O (19:81) as the solvent, ﬂow rate 10 mL/min; UV detection at 248 nm] to aﬀord sesquiterpene 1 (3.5 mg). Fraction 4 (15.0 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phenomenex 21.20 · 250 mm; using CH3CN:H2O (22:78) as the solvent, ﬂow rate 10 mL/ min; UV detection at 248 nm] to aﬀord sesquiterpenes 2 (2.5 mg) and 4 (4.0 mg). Fraction 5 (30.0 mg) was puriﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC [Luna Phenyl-hexyl, 10 lm, Phe- nomenex 21.20 · 250 mm] using CH3CN:H2O (29:71) as the solvent, ﬂow rate 10 mL/min; UV detection at 248 nm] to aﬀord sesquiterpenes 3 (4.0 mg) and 5 (4.8 mg). 3.7.1.
