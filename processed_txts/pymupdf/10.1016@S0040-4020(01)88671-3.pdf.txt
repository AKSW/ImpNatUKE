ISOLATION, STRUCTURE DETERMINATION, AND  ABSOLUTE CONFIGURATION OF BARBATUSOL; A NEW  BIOACTIVE DITERPENE WITH A REARRANGED ABIETANE  SKELETON FROM THE LABIATE COLEUS BARBATUS  ALPHONSE  KELECOM  NCcleo de Pesquisas de Produtos  Naturais,  CCS Universidade  Federal do Rio de Janeiro.  Bloc0 H Ilha do Fond&o. 21941. Rio de Janeiro RJ. Brazil  (Recoiurd  in UK IO January  1983)  Abstract-Barbatusol.  isolated  from the labiate  Coleus  barbatus  Bentham,  is shown  to be a new phenolic  diterpene  with a rearranged  abietane skeleton.  Absolute configuration  is established  by hemisynthesis  of barbatusol  dimethyl-ether  from the known carnosol.  Barbatusol  is endowed  of biological  activity.  Known  as “boldo”  in Brazil,  the Labiate  Coleus bar-  batus  Bentham  is largely  used in popular  medicine  against  liver  fatigue  and intestinal  disorders.  Several  abietane diterpenes  have been isolated from the leaves of  the plant grown in Brazil’  whilst the leaves of C. bar-  batus of Kenya  afforded  highly unsaturated  rearranged  abietanes2  and the roots of the Indian C forskolii  (syn of  C. barbatus)  furnished  polyhydroxylated  labdane  diter-  penes,’  two of them, forskoline  and colenol,  exhibiting  potent antihypertensive  activity.4.S  This  prompted  us to reinvestigate  the Brazilian  C.  barbatus  looking  for new cardioactive  compounds.’  In  this paper, we wish to report on the isolation,  structure  elucidation,  absolute  configuration  and partial  synthesis  of  barbatusol  (I),’  (SS)-9(10+20)-abeo-abieta-l(lO),  8,l l,l3-tetraen-I  1,12-diol,  a new  bioactive  diterpene  obtained  from  C. barabatus  collected  in the surround-  ings of Rio de Janeiro.  In a previous  communication,”  we reported  that the  dichloromethane  crude  extract  of the bark and heart-  wood of C. barbatus  showed, at doses of 10 mg/kg (i.v.),  a small cardiovascular  activity  in nembutal  anaesthetised  rats. Purification  of the crude extract  was monitored  by  bioassays  and involved  gel filtration  on Sephadex  LH-20  followed  by silica gel column  chromatography.  Besides  (t)-ferruginol  (II) (yield:  0.07%),  we isolated  a yellow  gummy compound,  turning to reddish-brown  on standing,  for  which  the name  barbatusol’  (yield:  0.15%)  was  coined,  and which induced  at 3 mg/kg (i.v. rats) potent  lowering  of blood pressure  associated  to discrete  brady-  tardy  High resolution  mass spectrometry  of barbatusol  (I)  established  empirical  formula  CZOHz80t  (300.2089,  requires  300.2089).  The  IR spectrum  shows  OH  ab-  sorption  (uOH 3580 and 3540 cm-‘).  Acetylation  of I  afforded  diacetate  III showing that both 0 atoms are part  of OH groups. The phenolic  nature  of the OH groups  was suggested  by the absence from the “C NMR  spec-  trum of I of any saturated  C substituted  by an 0 atom,  and also by the position  of the CO vibrations  in the IR  spectrum  of 111 (v~.~  1760cm  ‘) together  with the low  field position of both Me signals (2.29 and 2.30 ppm) and  the absence  of deshielded  carbinol  protons  in the ‘H  NMR  spectrum  of diacetate  III. The diphenol  was fur-  ther substantiated  by the UV spectrum  of I (A,,, 275 nm,  e = 2400 and 210 nm, c = 180)  also  showing  that  the  OH  groups  are not para  to each other.’  The  ortho  relationship  between  the OH groups was established  by  Ag,O oxidation  of I into o-quinone  IV characterized  by  CO absorptions  in IR at 1670 and 1645cm  ’ and UV  absorptions  at 438 (E = IOOO), 270 (E = 4095) and 227 nm  (E = 8390).9 The pentasubstituted  nature of the aromatic  ring depended  on the presence  in the ‘H NMR  spectrum  of a IH aromatic  broad singlet at 6.52ppm  in I deshiel-  ded to 6.92 ppm in 111. Four of the seven unsaturations  of  barbatusol  (1) are introduced  by the aromatic  nucleus. A  fifth was found associated  with a trisubstituted  double  bond (IR:  970cm-‘;  ‘H NMR:  IH t at 5.50ppm  J =  3.0 Hz;  ‘“C NMR:  140.25 ppm (s) and 120.89 ppm (d)).  The two remaining  unsaturations  were thus attributed  to  two additional  rings. Hence,  barbatusol  (1) is a tricyclic  aromatic  diterpene  for which an abietane  skeleton  could  be postulated  since several abietane diterpenes,  including  (+)-ferruginol  (II),  had already  been isolated  from  C.  barbatus.‘.6  The ‘H NMR  spectrum  of 1 shows striking  similarities  with that of pisiferol  (V),‘”  and was charac-  terized  by the presence  of only four Me signals, two as  superposed  doublets  (J = 7.0 Hz) at 1.20 ppm and two as  singlets at 0.85 and 0.89ppm.  Noteworthy  was the ab-  sence of the C-20 Me signal. a singlet at ca I .20 ppm in  the ferruginol  series.”  The two Me singlets were asso-  ciated with a gem-dimethyl  moiety  since only one qua-  ternary  saturated  C  was  observed  in  “C  NMR  (32.01 ppm,s).  On the other  hand,  double  irradiation  experiments  proved that the two Me doublets  were part  of an isopropyl  group  whose  methine  proton  shift  (3.lOppm)  suggested  the i-propyl  group to be linked to  the aromatic  ring.”  This was confirmed  by the small  upfield  shift (0.23 ppm) of the methine  proton  of the  isopropyl  group observed,  on acetylation,  in the ‘H NMR  spectrum  of 111. This spectrum  also shows that the Me  groups of the isopropyl  were no longer equivalent  (two  3H d J =7.0Hz  at 1.19 and 1.20ppm)  due to hindered  free rotation  of the isopropyl  group ’ and suggested that  the latter is probably  flanked  by an OH group. The C-7  benzylic  methylene  of tricyclic  aromatic  diterpenes”  was observed  as a 2H ill-resolved  dd (W,,, = I6 Hz) at  2.82ppm;  the multiplicity  of this signal showed that the  C-7 methylene  is adjacent  to another  methylene  group.  Finally,  a 2H AR quartet  (J = I5 Hz) was observed  at  3.09 and 3.70 ppm; the large coupling constant associated  to it was found in good agreement  with a gum coupling.  ?604  .4. KEIM‘OM  The low field position of this methylene  group suggested  it to be adjacent  to two deshielding  groups, namely  the  aromatic  ring and the trisubstituted  double  bond. This  conclusion  was further  supported  by catalytic  hydro-  genation  of I to the mixture  of epimers  at C-l (Vl.+b)  whose ‘H NMR  spectrum  was devoid of the AB signals  downfield  from 3.OOppm.  Furthermore,  the absence  of  coupling  between  the oletinic  proton  and the allylic-  benzylic  methylene  allowed  to propose  the following  sequence:  i  -CH=C-CH&  Indeed,  irradiation  of the  &  vinylic proton (bt at 5.50 ppm J = 3 Hz) did not affect the  AB pattern, but slightly modified the spectrum at I.90 ppm.  Conversely,  irradiaIion  at the latter frequency  transformed  the triplet at 5.50 ppm into a broad singlet, but had no effect  on the C-7 methylene  signal at 2.82 ppm. Based on the  abietane  skeleton  hypothesis  (for the arrangement  of the  aromatic  substituents),  fragment  “A” best accomodate  for  all our observations.  3.09 8 3.72  5.50  each d  /  \  1.19 d  J-Y  2.02 dd  A  However,  the presence  of two benzylic  methylenes  suggested  that  barbatusol  had a rearranged  abietane  skeleton  where  the missing  C-20 Me group should be  included  in ring B, by formal  migration  of the Cd,,  bond into the &-C,  position and subsequent  loss of one  proton  at C-l  to give rise to the trisubstituted  double  bond between  C-l and C-10. Hence,  structure I could be  proposed  for barbatusol.  The “C NMR  spectra of I and  III were found consistent  with this proposal.  Final proof  of structure  I and determination  of the  absolute  configuration  of barbatusol  came by obtention  of barbatusol  dimethyl-ether  (XII)  from carnosol (VII),  a  diterpene  whose  absolute  configuration  had  been  established  by correlation  with (+)_ferruginol  (II).”  Carnosol (VII) was isolated from the cultured Rosemary  (Rosmarinus  oficinalis)  by techniques  identical  to those  used for purification  of barbatusol.  Thus, obtention  of  barbatusol  dimethyl  ether (XII)  from VII was achieved,  after protection  of the catechol  moiety,  by removal  of  the  functionality  at C-7;  rearrangement  of a C-20  hydroxymkthylene  group,  leading  to B-ring  expantion,  furnished  the desired derivative  XII (Scheme  I).  Under  anhydrous  conditions,  methylation  of carnosol  (VII),  into dimethyl-ether  XIV,  is known  to proceed  slowly.‘~  When  conducted  in  wet  acetone  with  K2C0,.  2Hz0  as catalyst,  methylation  of the phenol  groups is accompanied  by opening  of the lactone  ring  and elimination  of the 0 function  at C-7 affording  com-  pound  VIII  in one step.  These  conditions  are  not  sufficient  to promote  alkaline  hydrolysis  of the S-lac-  tone.“.”  Since carnosol  dimethyl-ether  (XIV)  did not  react under similar  operating  conditions,  assistance  of  the OH group at C-12 could be postulated.  Obtention  of  VIII  may thus proceed  as proposed  in Scheme  2. Car-  nosol dimethyl-ether  (XIV)  was also obtained.  together  with VIII,  but in lower yield.  Catalytic  hydrogenation  of VIII  readily furnished  IX, a  derivative  already  obtained  by total methylation  of car-  nosic acid (XV),  but for which only partial chemical  data  had been reported.‘4.‘s  LAH  reduction  of the ester IX.  inefficient  at room temperature,  furnished  on refluxing  the expected  hydroxymethylene  X in only 60% yield,  together  with carnosic  acid dimethyl-ether  (XVI;  23%).  Acid XVI  is obviously  not an intermediate  in the reduc-  tion of IX into X since the latter was not produced  on  LAH  treatment  of XVI  in refluxing  THF.  Strong steric  hindrance  by the axial B-Me  group at C-4 may explain  the low yield in X.16 Treatment  of X with TsCI’  afforded  the less polar XI homogeneous  in TLC in various solvent  systems.

GLC analysis (3% OV-17)  MS and UV data also sup-  ported the identity  of XI with XII.  However,  ‘H NMR  showed XI to be a 6:4 mixture of double bond isomers  identified  as XI.  and Xl,,. All our attempts to separate  both isomers on silver nitrate impregnated  silica gel TLC  plates failed. The obtention  of XI,, from carnosol (VII)  proved the correctness of the structure of barbatusol (I).  Optical rotation measurements of barbatusol dimethyl-  ether (XII)  and of the synthetic  material XI.,,,  showed  that  both  samples  were  laevorotatory.  Since  Xlb  is  optically  inactive,  this proved barbatusol dimethyl-ether  (XII)  to have the same 5S absolute configuration  as XI,,  i.e. the H at C-5 is a-oriented.  This conclusion  could  have  been anticipated  since it is the same absolute  configuration  as that of (+)-ferruginol  (II) isolated from  Coleus barbatus  together  with  barbatusol  (I).  Hence  barbatusol  is: (SS)-9(1@-+20)-abeo-abieta-l(l0).  8.11,13-  tetraen-I 1,lZdiol.  It seems reasonable to speculate that  the driving  force for the hydroxymethylene  rearrange-  ment of X into  XI.  promoting  the B-ring  expansion.  may be seen in the presence of the bulky OMe group at  C-l I, since TsCl rearrangement  of pisiferol  (V) led only  to  A-ring  enlargement,  affording  pisiferin  (XVII).‘H  Finally. treatment of the mixture XI,,,  with BBr3  in dry  CH2Cd”  afforded.  but in poor yield,  the mixture  of  double bond isomers XIII,  where barbatusol  (I) is less  than  10% abundant  as deduced  from  the  ‘H  NMR  spectrum of XIII.
