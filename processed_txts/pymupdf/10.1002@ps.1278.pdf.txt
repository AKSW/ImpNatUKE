The extracts and fractions were incorporated into an artiﬁcial diet at 1 mg g−1 and offered to the insect during its larval stage. Length and viability of larval and pupal stages as well as pupal weight were assessed. Isolated compounds were tested through superﬁcial contamination of the diet at 0.1 mg g−1. Weight and viability of ten-day-old larvae were determined. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic S. densiﬂora extracts caused 100% larval mortality, while leaf and fruit hydroalcoholic extracts from V. polygama were the most active. Among the isolated compounds, ﬂavonoids presented the best insecticidal results, and tannins the best larval growth inhibition.  2006 Society of Chemical Industry Keywords: Tarum˜a; Uvatinga; Hoja Menuda; fall armyworm; Vitex polygama; Siphoneugena densiﬂora; Spodoptera frugiperda; botanical insecticide; pest control 1 INTRODUCTION With a projected increase in world population to 10 billion over the next four decades, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve maximum production of food and other products in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and cost effective.1 One major limiting factor to global food production is damage by pests, during both growth and storage stages. The use of synthetic pesticides has been an effective way to control pests, but their efﬁcacy is constantly weakened by development of resistance in economically important pests.2 Increasing interest in the application of plant secondary metabolites in insect pest management, as an alternative to the use of synthetic insecticides, has led to the search for active plant compounds, less poisonous to the environment and with low mammalian toxicity.3 Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noc- tuidae), the model insect pest selected, has a record of injuring over 80 plants, among them important ﬁeld crops such as corn, cotton, soybean and wheat. Larvae destroy the plant growth potential by con- suming foliage and burrowing into its growing points. The control of the damage requires high volumes of insecticide, resulting in resistance to several kinds of insecticidal compound.4 Of the two Brazilian plant species chosen to be bioassayed and phytochemically investigated, Vitex polygama Cham. (Verbenaceae) had already been studied, and many of its compounds characterized, but none was considered as a potential insecticide.5–9 This plant is commonly called ‘Maria-Preta’, ‘Tarum˜a’, ‘Congonha-cinco-folhas’ and the like.10,11 Its leaf tea has been used in folk medicine to treat kidney diseases.11 The other plant, Siphoneugena densiﬂora Berg (Myrtaceae), belongs to a genus comprising only eight species, with two of them vulnerable to extinction in S˜ao Paulo State.12,13 Popularly named ‘Uvatinga’,13 it has been pointed out as a source of energy generation in a recent investigation,14 and herbarium observations by the present authors indicate that this species shows strong resistance to insect attack. ∗ Correspondence to: Margareth BC Gallo, Departamento de Qu´ımica, Universidade Federal de S ˜ao Carlos (UFSCar), CP 676, 13565-905, S ˜ao Carlos-SP, Brazil E-mail: marejor@uol.com.br †This paper was given in part at the XX Brazilian Congress of Entomology, Gramado-RS-Brazil, 5-10 September 2004, Abstract EN-335, p. 341.

Pest Manag Sci 1526–498X/2006/$30.00 Natural products active against S. frugiperda Even though the selected plant species have not been ordinarily employed in pest control, their families comprise several species with injurious properties to insects reported in the literature.15–21 The present paper speciﬁcally deals with the effects of crude extracts, fractions and isolated compounds from V. polygama and S. densiﬂora against fall armyworm (S. frugiperda). Aspects examined include insecticidal and growth regulatory activities. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 General Heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bonding correlation (HMBC, J 8.0 Hz) experiments as well as 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents (deuteropyridine, acetone-d6 or deuteromethanol) from Aldrich Chemi- cal Company, Inc. (Milwaukee, WI, USA), or Merck- Schuchardt (8011 Hohenbrunn bei M¨unchen), using TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal reference. The equipment employed was either a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany; 1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz) or a Bruker ARX-200 spectrometer (1H, 200 MHz; 13C, 50 MHz). Low- resolution electrospray mass spectroscopy (ESI/MS) was carried out on a Micromass Quattro LC triple- quadrupole instrument (Manchester, UK). IR spectra were measured on a Bomem MB-102 spectropho- tometer (Quebec, Canada) in potassium bromide pel- lets. UV spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 500 Scan/UV-Vis-Nir spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Aus- tralia). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisted of a Shimadzu LC-10AD pump (Kyoto, Japan), an SPD-10A UV-Vis detector and a CBM-10A interface, using a Shodex Asahipack GS-310 preparative column (50.0 × 2.5 cm ID). Data acquisition was performed on CLASS LC10 software. Column chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel (70–230 or 230–400 mesh; Merck KGaA, 64 271, Darmstadt, Germany), Sephadex LH-20 (25–100 µm; Pharmacia Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, Uppsala, Sweden) or XAD7 (Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). Spots were visualized under 254 nm UV light and by spraying with either vanillin sulfuric acid solution followed by heating or FeCl3 acid solution. Methanol (JT Baker, Philipsburg, PA, USA) used for the mobile phase in HPLC analysis was HPLC grade. All other solvents used in extraction and isolation of compounds were of analytical grade (Mallinkrodt Baker, SA, Xalostoc, Mexico) or home distilled. 2.2 Plants Vitex polygama and Siphoneugena densiﬂora were collected in July 2000, in the city of Po¸cos de Caldas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora Herbarium (Minas Gerais) and at the Botany Institute Herbarium, Universidade de S˜ao Paulo, Brazil, respectively. 2.3 Extraction and isolation The powder of the air-dried plant organs was extracted successively with hexane and methanol by percolation at room temperature. Crude extracts were obtained after ﬁltration and removal of the solvents under vacuum at 40 ◦C. Hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained by stirring 100 g of the residue with methanol + water (50 + 50 by volume; 3 × 300 mL) with ultrasonic mixing for 10 min. The resulting ﬁltrates were combined, evaporated under vacuum (40 ◦C) and lyophilized (Table 1). Some crude extracts were dissolved in water + methanol (1 + 1 by volume) and fractionated through liquid–liquid partition using solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol). The corresponding labeled layers are characterized in Table 1. Compounds 1 to 43 were obtained by submitting the most active extracts (see Table 2) to several chromatographic techniques. Procedures to isolate the substances bioassayed (1, 9, 14 to 18, 25, 26 and 43; see Fig. 1) are described below. Some of them, like compounds 15 and 16, were isolated from more than one different extract of the same plant. 2.3.1 Isolation of compounds 13 to 19 from Siphoneugena densiﬂora (SD-EMR layer) A quantity of 9 g of SD-EMR (Table 1) was subjected to CC using silica gel (38.0 × 5.0 cm) with dichloromethane + ethyl acetate (7 + 3 by volume) as eluent and gradient elution.

Fraction 4 (MV4, 168.1 mg) was rechromatographed over the same column containing Sephadex LH-20 and eluted with methanol. A total of 23 fractions of 30 mL were collected and pooled into seven fractions (MV4s to MV4z). Fraction 4 (MV4v, 57.9 mg) was further puriﬁed by R-HPLC (column ASAHIPAK GS-310 SHODEX, mobile phase methanol, ﬂowrate 3 mL min−1; λ 330 nm) to yield compound 1 (ﬁrst peak, 5.5 mg) and substances 7 and 8, identiﬁed as a mixture, (second peak, 3.1 mg), after three cycles of 54 min. 2.3.5 Isolation of compounds 9 to 11 from Vitex polygama (VP-EMT layer) A quantity of 1.9 g and 900 mg of VP-EMT layer (Table 1) were submitted to column chromatogra- phy (3.0 × 46.0 cm) using Sephadex LH-20 and methanol as eluent. A total of 23 fractions of 50 mL were collected. Similar fractions were combined, yield- ing seven fractions (EMT1 to EMT7). Fraction 3 (EMT3, 551.0 mg) was rechromatographed over sil- ica gel (230–400 mesh) using gradient elution from ethyl acetate + dichloromethane (9 + 1 by volume) to methanol; 60 fractions of 50 mL were obtained and combined into 17 fractions (EMT3a to EMT3r). Frac- tion 5 (EMT3e, 140.5 mg) was puriﬁed by preparative TLC on silica gel 60 F254 with double development, using dichloromethane + acetone (1 + 1 by volume) as mobile phase and UV detection, yielding com- pounds 9 (77.7 mg), 10 (11.0 mg) and 11 (14.3 mg) respectively. 2.4 Insect rearing Larvae of S. frugipereda used in the experiments were obtained from cultures at the Departamento de Entomologia, Fitopatologia e Zoologia Agr´ıcola of the Escola Superior de Agronomia Luiz de Queiroz, Universidade de S˜ao Paulo (ESALQ/USP), and maintained in environmental chambers at 25 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod. The artiﬁcial diet used for the bioassay and previously described22 contained cooked ‘carioca’ bean 37.5 g, 1076 Pest Manag Sci 62:1072–1081 (2006) DOI: 10.1002/ps Natural products active against S. frugiperda wheat germ 30.0 g, soy meal 15.0 g, casein 15.0 g, yeast extract 18.75 g, tetracycline 56.5 mg, agar 11.5 g, Vanderzant vitamin mixture for insects 4.5 mL, ascorbic acid 1.8 g, sorbic acid 0.9 g, methyl p- hydroxybenzoate 1.5 g, formaldehyde (40% v/v) 1.8 mL and distilled water 600 mL, in a total volume of 720 mL. 2.5 Toxicity bioassays by ingestion against Spodoptera frugiperda 2.5.1 Crude extracts and layers A quantity of 100 mg of crude extracts or fractions was diluted in a small volume of acetone (e.g. 2 mL) along with ascorbic acid (ingredient of the artiﬁcial diet). The solvent was allowed to evaporate for 1 h, and the resultant mixture was ground to powder and incorporated into the liquid diet (100 g), at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg g−1. The liquid diet was distributed in portions (10 g) into ten glass tubes (8.5 × 2.5 cm, previously sterilized for 1 h at 170 ◦C), covered with sterile hydrofugous (not absorbent) cotton and then left for 24 h at room temperature to eliminate excess humidity. One ﬁrst-instar S. frugiperda larva (from 0 to 3 h old) was then placed in each tube and held at 25 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod for about 20 days until pupation (each experiment comprised ten glass tubes, each containing a single ﬁrst-instar S. frugiperda larva, totaling 10 larvae). Mortality was determined for each larva every 24 h; cessation of movement followed by color change to black was the criterion used for judging mortality. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbot’s formula.23 On the day after pupation, live pupae were weighed and transferred to transparent plastic vials (6.0 × 6.0 cm) containing ﬁlter paper at the bottom (4.0 × 4.0 cm), wetted by two drops of distilled water and maintained at the same conditions as the larvae until adults emerged (10–20 additional days). Other developmental factors were recorded, such as time to pupation and adult emergence. The control diet was prepared by adding the mixture of ascorbic acid and acetone previously evaporated and ground. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts insoluble in acetone were prepared in methanol and water respectively, as well as their respective controls. 2.5.2 Isolated compounds Four well plates (24 × 1.5 mL wells) were ﬁlled with the liquid diet and left for 1 h at room temperature in a decontaminated (UV light) laminar ﬂow hood. Each compound (12.0 mg) was dissolved in 3 mL of distilled water, and 30 µL aliquots were layered on the top of each well containing the artiﬁcial congealed diet. The ﬁnal concentration was about 0.1 mg g−1. The surface excess solvent was allowed to evaporate for about 1 h under sterile conditions. Subsequently, a single second-instar S. frugiperda larva was placed on the diet mixture in each well and maintained for 10 days, under the same conditions as in Section 2.5.1. The percentage insect mortality was corrected using Abbott’s formula.23 Each single experiment contained a total of 96 larvae (each plate of 24 wells with four replicates). Controls were carried out in a similar way without addition of the test compound. 2.6 Statistical analysis Data consisting of the average value for each experimental unit were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA).

S. densiﬂora polar extracts (SD-ML, SD-HAL, SD- MS, SD-HAS, SD-MT, SD-HAT, SD-MR, SD- HAR) were responsible for the highest mortalities (100%), followed by VP-HAL (60%), VP-HF (90%) and VP-HAF (100%) extracts from Vitex polygama, taking into account the treatment period (Table 2). They were then considered promising sources of active secondary metabolites and were further submitted to liquid–liquid partition. Partition of VP-HAL produced a VP-BHAL fraction with increased activity (100%), whereas the resultant fractions in the SD-MR partition (SD-EMR and SD- AMR respectively) retained the same potent activity as the original extract (100%, Table 2). The VP-MT extract (Table 2) was also fractionated, in spite of its lack of activity, on the basis of literature reports that a similar extract of Vitex madiensis caused death by disruption of the moulting cycle in S. frugiperda.30 Ecdysteroids 9 to 12 (Fig. 1), known for their various effects on insects,31 were obtained in the fractionation of this extract. Flavonoid 7, isolated from the VP-BHAL layer, is reported in the literature32 to have an insecticidal effect, but it was not isolated in sufﬁcient amounts to be bioassayed. The ﬂavonoids quercetin (25) and quercitrin (26) were highly active substances causing larval mortality of 78 and 85% (Table 3) respectively after 10 days of treatment. This result could be explained by earlier reports indicating that quercetin (25) may be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase,33 of cytochrome P450- dependent mixed function oxidases (MFO)34 and of midgut glutathione S-transferases from S. frugiperda.35 In addition, quercitrin (26), a ﬂavonol glycoside, may be hydrolysed when ingested by some insects, so releasing its aglycone, quercetin.32 The other compounds tested (Fig. 1) showed poor results, with a maximum larval mortality of 26%, a value statistically not signiﬁcantly different (P < 0.05) from the control (Table 3). Compound 17, when layered on the top of the diet, became dark-brownish after a few hours, probably indicating oxidation and loss of activity. 3.3 Developmental effects In general, no statistically signiﬁcant differences in pupation time and emergence were observed in the tests with extracts and fractions, except for two, VP- HL and VP-HF, which showed signiﬁcantly extended larval periods of 6 and 15 days respectively above those of the controls (Table 2). Moreover, VP-HL caused 10% of malformed pupae, 20% of uncompleted second-instar larvae and 30% of pupae that did not reach adult stage. Compound 9, originating from an inactive extract (VP-MT, Table 2), caused a moderate but statis- tically signiﬁcant larval weight loss in relation to the control after 10 days of treatment (P < 0.05; Table 3). The effects of ecdysteroids are known to be surprisingly complex and dependent on the concentration of compound and the developmen- tal stage of the insect,31 which could explain that result. Although the bioassay used does not address behavioral responses (inhibition of feeding), the results suggest that larval weight loss caused by compounds 14 and 43 (Table 3) may be correlated with feeding deterrence. In fact, it is known that tannins reduce plant palatability and act as inhibitors of digestion by precipitating food protein and digestive enzymes.36 In addition, there is evidence that some species of Lepidoptera have taste receptors that respond to some phenolics.32 However, tannins 15 and 17 were practically inactive in this respect, probably because some tannins may be oxidized37 or hydrolyzed during passage through the insect gut,36 reducing their effectiveness. According to Urrea- Bulla et al.,38 gallic acid (13), the compound isolated from several extracts of S. densiﬂora and also a probable product of hydrolysis of compound 14, signiﬁcantly reduces larval growth of S. frugiperda at 1 mg g−1. 4 CONCLUSIONS Polar extracts from S. densiﬂora and the VP-BHAL layer displayed considerable insecticidal activity, and may be efﬁcient alternatives to conventional synthetic insecticides in the integrated pest management of S. frugiperda. Moreover, the feeding deterrence caused by tannin 14 along with the insecticidal effects of ﬂavonoids 25 and 26 might explain the 100% outcome when the SD-ML extract was tested. In addition, compound 14 might be acting synergistically with 43, and in concert with daucosterol (19), known for its insecticidal action,15 phenolic acid 13 and other Pest Manag Sci 62:1072–1081 (2006) 1079 DOI: 10.1002/ps MBC Gallo et al. compound(s) not tested or characterized, emphasizing the excellent results obtained with extracts SD-MS and SD-MR respectively.
