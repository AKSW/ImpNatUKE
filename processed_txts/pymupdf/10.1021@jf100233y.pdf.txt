The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent, and the esters were significantly more effective than gallic acid. Gallic acid and its esters were compared with regard to their reactivity to free radicals, using the DPPH and AAPH/pyranine free- cell assays, and no significant difference was obtained. Gallic acid and its esters not only failed to inhibit the depletion of intracellular GSH in erythrocytes induced by AAPH but exacerbated it. Similarly, the oxidation of GSH by AAPH or horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 in cell-free systems was exacerbated by gallic acid or gallates. This property could be involved in the recent findings on pro- apoptotic and pro-oxidant activities of gallates in tumor cells. We provide evidence that lipophilicity and not only radical scavenger potency is an important factor regarding the efficiency of anti- hemolytic substances. KEYWORDS: Gallic acid; gallates; erythrocytes; hemolysis; glutathione; peroxyl radical; antioxidant; pro-oxidant activity INTRODUCTION Gallic acid and its derivatives are among the most abundant phenolic antioxidants in wines and green tea (1-3). This phyto- chemical is well-known for its antioxidant, antibacterial, anti- inflammatory, antimutagenic, and chemopreventive properties (4-7). The similar beneficial effects of the synthetic esters of gallic acid have been extensively studied, and in many cases, they are stronger than those of gallic acid itself. For instance, lauryl gallate (dodecyl gallate), a widely used food additive, is more efficient than gallic acid as an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, an endogenous source of the superoxide anion, and of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation induced by FeIII-NADPH (8). Methyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid at inhibiting oral bacterial growth and the formation of Streptococcus mutans biofilms (4). Methyl gallate inhibits the production of leukotriene C4 and prostaglandin D2 by bone-marrow-derived mast cells (9). Nonyl gallate is more effective than gallic acid against the growth of Salmonella choleraesuis (10). Lauryl gallate protects against the formationofdimethylbenzanthracene-inducedskintumorsinmice and kills, selectively, tumor cells in established tumors (11). Such biological activities have been correlated with the amphipathic feature of these ester derivatives (12), because the in vitro antioxi- dantpotentialisnearlythesameas thatofgallicacid. Hence, itmay be supposed that the accessibility of the gallates to the intracellular medium could be a determining factor for their effects. Another relevant property of gallates is their pro-oxidant characteristics. Indeed, the cytotoxic effect of octyl, dodecyl, and tetradecyl gallates on melanoma cells has recently been demonstrated (13, 14). This biological effect has been associated with DNA fragmentation, activation of NF-κB, inhibition of cell adhesion, and alteration of the cell redox status by depletion of both glutathione (GSH) and ATP (13). Similarly, the inhibition of HeLa cell growth by propyl gallate was associated with depletion of intracellular GSH and increased production of the superoxide anion (14). The hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an ex vivo model for studying reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced disruption of cell membranes and the protective effect of antioxi- dants. One of the most frequently studied models uses the water- solubleazocompound2,20-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH), which decomposes at physiological temperature (37 �C) *To whom correspondence should be addressed: Departamento de Quı´mica, Faculdade de Ci^encias, UNESP, Bauru, SP, CEP 17033-360, Brazil.

In the presence of dissolved molecular oxygen, this radical is converted to the corresponding peroxyl radical (ROO•) (15). The mechanism of erythrocyte hemolysis induced by thermolysis of AAPH is not completely understood, but it has been correlated with lipid peroxidation and oxidation of membrane proteins (16). The incubation of erythro- cytes with AAPH also provokes the depletion of intracellular GSH (17). Because the above biological phenomenon is associated with the disruption of the cell membrane and in view of increasing evidence that the lipophilicity of gallic acid esters is decisive for their beneficial effects, here, we aimed to synthesize selected gallate esters and compare their efficacy as inhibitors of AAPH- induced hemolysis and GSH depletion. The objective was to retain the same oxidizable moiety while altering the lipophili- city. Additionally, we studied and compared the antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects of gallic acid and gallates in cell-free systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals and Equipments. Gallic acid,vanillicacid,methylvanillate, (()-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), (()-R-tocopherol (vitamin E), 2,20-azobis(2- amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH), 5,50-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), glutathione (GSH), 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (pyranine), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), N,N0- dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, cumene hydroperoxide (Cu-OOH), horserad- ish peroxidase (HRP) (EC 1.11.1.7), and o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was prepared bydiluting a 30% stock solution and calcul- ating its concentration from its absorption at 240 nm (ε240=43.6 M-1 cm-1) (18). Column chromatography was carried out over 0.06-0.20 mm silica gel (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ). Gel permeation chromato- graphy (GPC) was performed with Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out in a Varian Prep-Star 400 system with a Pheno- menex C-18 (250 � 21.2 mm) column. The monodimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C), using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as solvents (Aldrich). All of the reagents used for buffers and mobile phases were analytical-grade. Stock solutions of antioxidants were prepared in ethyl alcohol. Ultrapure Milli-Q water from Millipore was used for the preparation of buffers and solutions. Gallic Acid Source. Gallic acid was extracted from Alchornea glandulosa. The leaves were collected in the Biological Reserve and Experimental Station at Mogi Guac-u, S~ao Paulo State, Brazil, in March 2005. A voucher specimen(SP319257) has beendeposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Institute (S~ao Paulo, SP, Brazil). The shade-dried plant material (1.5 kg) was ground and defatted with n-hexane (3.5 L � 3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with MeOH (4.2 L � 3). The crude extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 3.8 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH/H2O (4:1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH. After solvent removal in a rotary evaporator, the partition phases yielded 2.5 and 0.8 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (2.0 g) was chromato- graphed bygel permeation over Sephadex LH-20, eluted with methanol, to afford 11 fractions (A1-A11). Second-stage chromatographic purifica- tion of fraction A2 (730 mg) by reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC (7.5:92:0.5 MeOH/H2O/HOAc, UV detection at 265 nm, and flow rate at 15 mL/min) yielded gallic acid (335 mg). The identification was based on analysis of 1H and 13C NMR data, as well as by a comparison to authentic material obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Synthesis of Esters (Methyl, Propyl, and Lauryl). A 3 mL solution of N,N0-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 1.0 mmol) in p-dioxane was added to a cooled (5 �C) solution of 0.2 mmol of gallic acid and 20 mmol of methyl, propyl, or lauryl alcohol in 6 mL of p-dioxane. After the solution was stirred for 48 h, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was partitioned 3 times with EtOAc and filtered. The filtrate was washed successively with saturated aqueous citric acid solution (3 times), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (3 times), and water (2 times), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude products were purified over a silica gel column eluted isocratically with CHCl3/MeOH (98:2). Structures of the semi-synthetic esters were estab- lished by 1H and 13C NMR spectral analysis. Erythrocyte Suspension. Human erythrocytes from healthy donors were obtained from peripheral blood, centrifuged at 770g for 10 min, and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. The supernatant and buffy coat were removed by aspiration after each wash. The cells were resuspended to 20% (v/v) in PBS. The blood samples were taken from healthy volunteers. The study was approved by the faculty research ethics committee. Hemolysis Assays. The hemolysis studies were performed as pre- viously described (19), with modifications. Equal amounts of erythrocytes suspension and 100 mM AAPH in PBS were gently homogenized while being incubated for 6 h at 37 �C (blood tube rotator). Aliquots (75 μL) were removed at regular intervals, diluted 1:20 with PBS, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The degree of hemolysis was measured in the supernatant by its absorbance at 540 nm. Reference values (100% hemolysis) were determined with the same aliquot of erythrocytes but diluted in 1500 μL of distilled water instead of PBS to provoke the total lysis of the erythrocytes. By diluting the 100% hemolysis sample in PBS, a calibration curve of percent hemolysis against absorbance was constructed for conversion of the absorbance measurement to degrees of hemolysis. The blank was PBS, and measurements were made in a UV-1240 spectro- photometer (Shimadzu, Japan). When used, 10 μL aliquots of inhibitors in ethanol were added at the beginning of the reaction. The same volume of ethyl alcohol (10 μL) was added to the negative (without AAPH) and positive (with AAPH) controls. In the studies where cumene hydroper- oxide (Cu-OOH) was the hemolytic agent, this compound (500 μM) was used instead of AAPH. Determination of Intracellular GSH. The intracellular concentra- tion of GSH in erythrocytes was determined using the DTNB method (19), with modifications. The 20% suspension of erythrocytes (100 μL) was incubated with 100 μL of 50 mM AAPH at 37 �C for 2.0 h. After incubation, the suspension was diluted to 1000 μL with PBS and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was lysed by adding 700 μL of distilled H2O. The protein in 700 μL of lysate was precipitated by adding 500 μL of an aqueous solution of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After 5 min, the protein precipitate was separated from the remaining solution by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (500 μL) was made alkaline by adding 187.5 μL of Na2HPO4 (300 mM) and 62.5 μL of NaOH (1 M). Next, 450 μL of Na2HPO4 (300 mM) and 100 μL of DTNB solution (0.2 mg/mL in 1.0% sodium citrate) were added to 450 μL of the alkaline mixture. In the blank, 500 μL of supernatant was mixed with 250 μL of PBS instead of 187.5 μL of Na2HPO4 and 62.5 μL of NaOH, after which 450 μL of PBS and 100 μL of DTNB were added to 450 μL of this mixture. Each sample test or control had its blank. The absorbance was read at 412 nm. A standard curve was constructed to measure the concentration of GSH. In this case, 700 μL of lysate was replaced by 700 μL of solutions of GSH at several concentrations. The hemoglobin content (Hb) in an aliquot of the lysate (prior precipitation with TCA) was determined by the cyanohemoglobin method. The GSH values were expressed as μmol/g Hb (20). Oxidation of GSH by AAPH. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 2.5 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 �C for 1.0 h (21). When present,gallic acid and gallates (100 μM) were added beforethe addition of AAPH. The remaining concentration of GSH was measured bythe DTNB method as follows: 0.45 mL of the reaction mixture was added to 0.45 mL of 300 mM Na2HPO4 and 0.1 mL of DTNB solution (0.2 mg/mL in 1.0% sodium citrate). The absorbance at 412 nm was read against a blank consisting of 0.45 mL of PBS, 0.45 mL of 300 mM Na2HPO4, and 0.1 mL of DTNB. An analytical curve was produced using standard GSH solutions, which were submitted to the DTNB methods. Oxidation of GSH by HRP/H2O2. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 100 μM H2O2 and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS at 37 �C (21). When present, gallic acid and gallates (100 μM) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μg/mL catalase. The remaining concentration of GSH was measured by the DTNB method as above. Measurement of GSH and GSSG by HPLC. A solution of GSH (100 μM) was incubated with 100 μM H2O2 and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS at Article J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 5357 37 �C. When present, apocynin, gallic acid, and gallates (100 μM) were added before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μg/mL catalase. The concentration of GSH and its oxidized form (GSSG) were determined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection, as previously described (22): For GSH determination, 50 μL of the above reaction mixture was added to 1.0 mL of 0.1% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. To a 20 μL aliquot of this mixture, 300 μL of 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0 and 20 μL of 0.1% OPA in methanol were added and this reaction mixture was incubated at 25 �C for 15 min in the dark in well-capped tubes, after which 20μL ofeachsamplewas injectedintothe HPLCsystem. For GSSG determination, a 200 μL aliquot of the reaction mixture was incubated at 25 �C with 200 μL of 40 mM NEM, for 25 min, in the dark, to react with the GSH present in the sample. To this mixture, 750 μL of 0.1 M NaOH was added. A 20 μL portion of this mixture was taken for measurement of GSSG, using the procedure outlined above for the GSH assay, except that 0.1 M NaOH was employed as the diluent rather than 0.1% EDTA in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 8.0. The HPLC method for the determination of GSH and GSSG is based on derivatization with OPA to form a stable, highly fluorescent derivative (23). The derivatives of GSH and GSSG were separated by liquid chromatography (Varian ProStar in line with a fluorescence detector set at 350/420 nm). The analyses were carried out isocratically on a Luna C18 reversed-phase column (250 � 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase consisted of 15% methanol in 25 mM Na2HPO4 at pH 6.0 (flow rate of 0.5 mL/min). Measurement of Oxygen Consumption. The consumption of dis- solved molecular oxygen during the oxidation of GSH was monitored in a YSI 5300A oxygen monitor (Yellow Spring, OH). The reaction mixture of 1 mM GSH, 100 μM H2O2, and 0.1 μM HRP in PBS was incubated at 37 �C in the presence or absence (control) of 10 μM apocynin or gallates. The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2. The oxygen consumption was monitored for 10 min. Pyranine-Based Procedure for Evaluation of the Reactivity of Gallates with Peroxyl Radicals Generated by AAPH Thermolysis. This experiment was performed as described by Lissi et al. (24), with minor modifications. The experiments were based on the decay in the fluores- cence of pyranine when it was submitted to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. The fluorescent compound pyranine (5 μM) was incubated with 20 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 �C in the absence (control) or presence of gallates in the wells of a microplate. The fluorescence bleaching of the pyranine was monitored at λex=460 nm and λem=510 nm in a Spectramax M2 micro- plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The final reaction volume was 300 μL. The lag phase (induction time) obtained when the antioxidants were present was measured for various concentrations of each gallate. The slopes of the curves of induction time versus concentra- tion were used to measure the relative reactivity of the gallates with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. Free-Radical Scavenging Activity on DPPH/DPPH Bleaching Assay. The free-radical scavenger activity of gallic acid and its esters was compared by the DPPH bleaching assay (25). The antioxidants were incubated for 30 min with 100 μM DPPH in methyl alcohol in the dark. The scavenger activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 517 nm, using the absorbance of the unreacted DPPH radical as the control. The scavenger activity was calculated as ((absorbance of the control - absorbance of the sample)/absorbance of the control) � 100. RESULTS We studied the hemolysis of erythrocytes and the protective effect of gallic acid and its esters. The molecular structures of the compounds studied are shown in Figure 1. Hemolysis was provoked by thermolysis of the azo compound AAPH, which generates a low but constant flux of peroxyl radicals when incubated at 37 �C (15). Figure 2 shows the kinetic profile of hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid and propyl gallate. The inhibition of hemolysis was dose-dependent (Figure 3), and the esters methyl gallate (G1), propyl gallate (G3), and lauryl gallate (G12) were more effective inhibitors than their acid precursor, gallic acid (G0) (Table 1). Because the above results suggest a higher efficacy of the esters as free-radical scavengers, we also compared their relative potency in cell-free models. First, they were compared as scav- engers of the stable free-radical DPPH. The results depicted in Table 2 show that no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its ester derivatives. In a second set of experiments, we studied the direct reactivity of gallic acid and its esters with AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals. In this assay, the relative reactivity of the antioxidants with peroxyl radicals is determined by the lag phase in the decay of pyranine fluorescence (24). Figure 4 shows the typical time profile of the bleaching obtained when pyranine was incubated with AAPH in the presence of gallic acid and methyl gallate. The linear relation between the delay and the concentration of gallic acid or gallates was used to measure the reactivity of the tested compound with AAPH. In this design, the slope of the curve is directly proportional to the efficiency of the antioxidant as a scavenger of peroxyl radicals. Figure 4 also shows the typical linear correlation between the concentration and lag phase for gallic acid and methyl gallate. The slopes obtained were 442 ( 30 for gallic acid, 499 ( 31 for methyl gallate, 453 ( 6 for propyl gallate, and 187 ( 7 for lauryl gallate (mean ( SEM, n = 3). As can be observed, only lauryl gallate presented a Figure 1. Chemical structures of the compounds used in this study. Figure 2. AAPH-induced hemolysis and the protective effect of gallic acid (G0) and propyl gallate (G3). The reaction mixture (positive control) contained 10% (v/v) erythrocytes and 50 mM AAPH in PBS at 37 �C. The results are mean ( standard error of the mean (SEM) of duplicates of three separate experiments. 5358 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 Ximenes et al. decreased reactivity with peroxyl radicals in this experimental model. Considering the above cell-free studies, the stronger antihemo- lytic effect of the gallates, relative to that of gallic acid, suggests that lipophilicity is a determining factor in this experimental model. To verify this proposal, we also compared the antioxidant vanillic acid versus its methyl ester (methyl vanillate) and trolox, a morewater-soluble form ofvitamin E,versusvitamin E itself. The results with these two different classes of antioxidants followed the same pattern as that for gallates and gallic acid, reinforcing the suggestion that lipophilicity of antioxidants is crucial with respect to antihemolytic protection (Table 1). The direct hemolytic capacity of gallic acid and gallates was also investigated, because these compounds could interact with and disrupt the erythrocyte membrane. In these experiments, gallic acid and gallates were incubated with erythrocytes with- out AAPH. The results in Table 3 show that only the 12-carbon ester lauryl gallate caused significant hemolysis after incubation for 6 h. The protective effect of gallates was not restricted to AAPH- induced hemolysis. The results given in Table 4 show that gallates were also effective when the hemolysis was provoked by incuba- tion of erythrocytes with cumene hydroperoxide. Again, there was a correlation with lipophilicity. In a further experiment, the protective effect of gallic acid and gallates on the depletion of intracellular GSH induced by AAPH was also studied. Despite their antihemolytic properties, gallic acid and gallates were unable to inhibit the oxidation of GSH when erythrocytes were incubated with AAPH. On the contrary, the depletion of GSH was exacerbated by methyl and lauryl gallates (Table 5). To clarify these findings, we studied the direct reaction between pure GSH and AAPH-derived peroxyl radicals and tested the effect of gallic acid and gallates on this reaction. Again, the presence of gallic acid and gallates tended to exacerbate the oxidation of GSH (Figure 5). In another set of experiments, pure GSH was oxidized by H2O2 in a reaction catalyzed by HRP. Because GSH is a poor substrate for peroxidase, the efficiency of oxidation was low (26). However, the addition of gallic acid and gallates caused a strong increase in the oxidation of GSH (Figure 6). It is well-known that some phenolic compounds are able to act as a co-catalyst in reactions of inefficient peroxidase substrates, such as GSH. In such situations, the oxidized intermediate phenolic radical is reduced back and GSH is converted to GSSG. Moreover, during this redox cycle, the dissolved molecular oxygen in the reaction mixture is consumed, being reduced to superoxide anion (27). For these reasons and in light of our results, we measured the production of GSSG and the oxygen consumption as GSH was oxidized by HRP/H2O2 in the presence of gallic acid or gallates. To ascertain whether our experimental conditions for assessing the co-catalytic effectof phenols upon the oxidation of GSH was correct, we used apocynin, which is able to initiate this process, as a reference compound (28). As can be seen in Figure 7, both gallic acid and apocynin exacerbated the oxidation of GSH; however, only in the presence of apocynin was GSSG obtained as a product. Similarly, only in the presence of apocynin was the consumption of dissolved oxygen observed (Figure 8). The other gallates showed the same results as gallic acid (data not shown). DISCUSSION The hemolysis of erythrocytes has been extensively used as an ex vivo model in the study of ROS-induced disruption of cell membranes. The inhibitory property of many antioxidants upon AAPH-induced hemolysis is well-documented (29-32). However, there is no clear relationship between the molecular structure of the antioxidants and their efficiency as inhibitors. Here, working with gallic acid and its ester derivatives, we found Figure 3. Concentration-dependent effect of gallic acid (G0) and propyl gallate (G3) on AAPH-induced hemolysis.

Food Chem., Vol. 58, No. 9, 2010 5359 that lipophilicity seems to be an essential characteristic of an efficient antihemolytic compound. Similar findings were reported by Wu et al. that ranked the antihemolytic efficiency of gallates as propyl > ethyl > methyl (33). Corroborating this proposal, the correlation between efficacy against AAPH-induced hemolysis and lipophilicity was not restricted to gallic acid and its ester derivatives but extended to other classes of molecules, such as vanillic acid versus its lipophilic derivative methyl vanillate and trolox versus vitamin E. Moreover, the benefit of lipophilicity was not restricted to AAPH-induced hemolysis, because it was also seen when the erythrocytes were challenged with cumene hydro- peroxide. Reinforcing the importance of lipophilicity, our result showed clearly that higher antihemolytic efficacy of the gallates was not related to their oxidizability. Indeed, except for lauryl gallate, no significant difference was observed between gallic acid and its esters in their potential as antioxidants in cell-free systems. Only the 12-carbon chain ester was relatively poor as a peroxyl radical scavenger in the cell-free systems. Despite that and again reinfor- cing the importance of lipophilicity, lauryl gallate was a more efficient inhibitor of hemolysis than gallic acid. It is important to observe that any compound used as an antihemolytic agent when erythrocytes are challenged by free Figure 4.

This effect has been described, and there is a relationship between lipophilicity and hemolytic capacity deve- loped by many compounds (34, 35). Accordingly, lauryl gallate, the most lipophilic compound used in this study, was the only ester capable of inducing hemolysis of erythrocytes under our experimental conditions. Other important findings include the interaction of gallic acid and gallates with GSH. This chemical feature could explain or be involved in the recent findings about cellular pro-oxidant effects of gallates (13, 14). This tripeptide is the main endogenous antioxidant in mammalian cells, and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) reflects directly the redox status of the cell (36). It is well-known that redox homeostasis is crucial for cells to survive, and the pathophysiological mecha- nisms ofseveral diseasesare related tothe exacerbated production of ROS and/or decreased antioxidant functions (37). In fact, apoptosis, which is altered in tumor cells, strongly depends upon the GSH/GSSG ratio (38, 39). Two pathways could explanation the exacerbated oxidation of GSH whengallates are present in the reaction mixture or cellular medium. The first is the action of these compounds as co-catalysts, where the intermediate pheno- xyl radical would be reduced back to gallate with concomitant oxidation of GSH. This phenomenon is well-established for phenolic compounds, such as tyrosine and apocynin (27, 28), and the consequence of this redox cycle is the consumption of GSH, the formation of GSSG, and the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion (40). This was exactly what we observed for apocynin, used as a model for a comparison to gallates in this study. However, when gallates were used, the consumption of GSH was not followed by the formation of GSSG and the depletion of dissolved oxygen. Hence, this mechanism does not seem to be responsible for the augmented depletion of GSH caused by gallic acid and gallates. The second possible explanation for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates in the depletion of intracellular GSH is a chemical reaction between the oxidized trihydroxybenzene moi- ety, probably in its quinone form, and GSH via the Michael Figure 5.

This is a well-known reaction that involves electrophilic quinones and nucleophilic substances, such as GSH, leading to thiol adducts (41,42). In this case, the consumption of GSH is not followed by the formation of GSSG and oxygen consumption, as verified here. In summary, Scheme 1 shows our proposal for the involvement of gallic acid and gallates when these compounds were oxidized in the presence of GSH, which could explain the depletion of intracellular GSH as verified here and by others (13, 14).
