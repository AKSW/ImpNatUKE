Abstract--Seven neolignans, isolated from a C,H, extract of Nectundru mirunda (Lauraceae) trunk wood, included  the hitherto undescribed (2S, 3S, 3aS)- and (2S, 3S, 3aR)-5-allyl-3a-methoxy-2-(3’,  4’, 5’-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-  2,3, 3a, 6-tetrahydro-6-oxobenzofurans  (respectively mirandin-A  and mirandin-B),  7-allyl-6-hydroxy-S-methoxy-2-  (3’, 4’, S-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methylbenzofuran  and (2R, 3R)-7-methoxy-2-(3’, 4’, 5’-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-methyl-  5-Q-propenyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran  (licarin C).  INTRODUCllON  The biosynthesis of the guianin (4) [2,3] and burchellin  (Sa) [3-6] type neolignans  of Aniba species involves,  presumably,  the oxidative coupling  of propenyl-  and  allylphenols,  either by radical pairing  (1 + 2) [7] or  through  ionic intermediates.  It sulKces to postulate  the existence of the allylphenol  derived intermediate  in a mesomeric  form to rationalize  the formation  (1 + 3) of macrophyllin (6) [S] and to justify the expecta-  tion that the alternative type 7 also should be represented  in nature. This is indeed the case and we now report  that Nectandra miranda, Lauraceac, contains the miran-  dins A (7a) and B (7b).  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  3a-Methoxybenzofuranoid  neolignans  The mirandins A and B were recognized as neolignans  by their formulae,  CisH,.,02(0Me),,  and  spectra;  the similar ‘H-NMR and MS (m/e 208, 100%) clearly  pointing  in both cases to partial structure 8 with the  Ar and Me groups in a trans-relationship  [4]. The  additional  C,.C,-unit  must be represented by a cyclo-  hexadienone  [v_  (cm-‘)  mirandin  A 1666 ; mirandin  B 16801 linked at the sole and fully substituted  sp3-C  to a methoxyl (r mirandin  A 7.00; mirandin  B 6.88)  and at a spz-C to an ally1 group, as in 7. The ally1 can,  indeed, be located only on a spa-C, the doubly allylic  methylene  protons  being equivalent  (T mirandin  A  * Part 37 in the series ‘The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraccae.‘.

Among the  3 possible sites, C-7 and C-4 are incompatible  with the  representation  of the ring olefinic protons  by MR  singlets and the biosynthesis  which requires the ally1  group to be para-related with an oxy-function.  Since both compounds are represented by formula 7,  they must differ in the orientation  of the aliphatic  methoxyl. Indeed, the conspicuous  differences in the  ‘H-NMR  spectra, all refer to signals attributed  to  protons of the immediate vicinity of C-3a. Most sig-  nificantly,  the H-3  signal  of mirandin-A  appears  0.49 ppm downfield from the H-3 signal of mirandin-B.  This seems to indicate association  of H-3 to OMe-3a  in mirandin-A  (7a), in contradistinction  to the truns  relation of H-3/OMe-3a  in mirandin-B  (7b). Indeed  the analogous association is apparent in the ‘H-NMR  spectrum  of 2-epi-mirandin-A  (7c), the product  of  isomerization  by acid of 7a. Comparison  of the three  spectra reveals additionally  the expected relative shield-  ing of methoxyl only in the 2,3a-cis-derivative 7a (Table  1).  Photolysis  or pyrolysis of mirandin-A  leads to 9, a  compound which was obtained previously by pyrolysis  of the naturally  occurring  10 [S], and identified in-  clusively  with respect to stereochemistry.  Thus, 7a  registers the absolute configuration  of mirandin-A.  In solution,  the aryl and cyclodienone  moieties of  Table 1. ‘H-NMR comparison of the mirandins in CDCl,  7a  7b  7c  H-2 (T)  H-3 (T)  J,,,,,  (Hz)  OMe- 3a(r)  Me-3 (7)  4.84  4.68  3.94  7.35  7.84  7.30  co.5  9.5  5.0  7.00  6.88  6.82  8.89  8.85  9.48  745  146  C.

The  Cotton  effects associated  wtth the benzenoid and enone chromophores  are both  positive and cause an unresolved ORD curve between  250-310 nm. In contradistinction,  mirandin-B  (7l.r) is a  twisted  structure  (E 12100, v 1680cm-‘)  with the  dihedral  angle approaching  180” (JH_-Z.H_-J  = 9.5 Hz).  The Cotton effects associated  with the two chromo-  phones are of opposite signal in the region of benxenoid  (300 nm) and enone (280nm)  absorptions  (Table 2),  and cause a well resolved ORD curve. Correlation  of  the signal of these Cotton effects with aryl and methoxyl  (8)  (11)  � fully substituted spw,  configuration  was effected by analysis  of the ORD  curve of 2-epi-mirandin-A  (7~). This was derived from  mirandin-A  (7a) by epimerixation  only  of C-2. In  consequence,  no doubt  exists concerning  the (2R)-  configuration,  associated with a negative Cotton effect  in the 310 nm region, the (3aS)-conflguration,  associated  with a positive Cotton effect around 280nm, and the  (3!+cotiguration  of its chiral  centres.  Mirandin-B,  which causes a positive Cotton  effect in the 310nm  region and a negative  Cotton  effect in the 280nm  region, must consequently  possess the absolute  con-  figuration registered in 7b.  Configuration  and conformation  of the mirandins  are also discussed in a paper on the ‘%-NMR  spectra  of neolignans [9].
