The fungus led to the formation of a different product through an unusual epoxidation reaction between C4 and C5, formation of a C3,C10 ether bridge, and a methoxylation of the C1 of tagitinin C. The chemical structure of the product, namely 1b-methoxy-3a-hydroxy- 3,10b-4,5a-diepoxy-8b-isobutyroyloxygermacr-11(13)-en- 6a,12-olide, is the same as that of a derivative that was recently isolated from the ﬂowers of a Brazilian population of Mexican sunﬂower (Tithonia diversifolia), which is the source of the substrate tagitinin C. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the substrate and the biotransformed product were evaluated in HL-60 cells using an MTT assay, and both compounds were found to be cytotoxic. We show that soil fungi may be useful in the biotransformation of ses- quiterpene lactones, thereby leading to unusual changes in their chemical structures that may preserve or alter their biological activities, and may also mimic plant biosynthetic pathways for production of secondary metabolites.

They are considered chemical markers within the family and have ecological as well as economic value [10, 37]. Moreover, STLs exhibit an array of interesting biological activities such as antimicrobial [5], cytostatic [25], and antifeedant activities [30]. They are the main active con- stituents of many medicinal plants of Asteraceae world- wide [32]. Tagitinin C (1, Fig. 1) is an important STL occurring in the glandular trichomes of the leaves and inﬂorescences of Mexican sunﬂower (Tithonia diversifolia Hemsl. A. Gray, Asteraceae) [2]. It shows cytotoxic [19], anti-inﬂammatory [33], and antifeedant activities [2], and thus is a promising compound for further research into its mechanisms of action in different targets. T. diversifolia, the source of 1, is used in folk medicine in many countries [8, 14] and has B. A. Rocha � M. T. Pupo � S. Said � F. B.

How- ever, there remains concern regarding the ingestion of STLs because of their toxicity [35]. An interesting approach is to obtain STL derivatives that may have lower toxic effects or improved pharmacological activities, or both. Obtaining STL analogues, however, based on classic synthetic methods is not always a straightforward proce- dure, so the biotransformation of biologically active STLs is an attractive alternative providing new derivatives whose effects should be investigated [20]. The biotransformation of organic compounds by microorganisms is considered an economically and eco- logically viable technology. In addition, it is a useful tool for the structural modiﬁcation of bioactive natural products and the study of natural product metabolism [15, 16]. Moreover, some microorganisms can transform drugs in a similar way to mammals, and the utilization of microbial systems as models which mimic the metabolism of drugs in humans has received considerable attention [7, 16]. Fungal biotransformations of naturally occurring STLs have been carried out to obtain modiﬁcations that enhance activity and/or decrease toxicity [21, 24], develop structure– activity relationships [1, 4], and establish in vitro models to predict mammalian metabolites [3, 39]. A considerable number of biotransformations of STLs have been described using fungi [29]. Aspergillus niger (ATCC 16888), for example, transformed costunolide into four main products, 1b-hydroxyarbusculin, colartin, 11,13-dihydrosantamarine, and 11,13-dihydroreynosin [20]. In the same study, A. och- raceous (CECT 2069) transformed deoxyvulgarin into two products, vulgarin and dihydrodouglanin [20]. The microbial transformation of sclareolide by A. niger (ATCC 10549) yielded four oxidized metabolites identiﬁed as 1b-hydrox- ysclareolide, 3b-hydroxysclareolide, 1a,3b-dihydroxyscla- reolide, and 1b,3b-dihydroxysclareolide [31]. The STL artemisitene was metabolized by A. niger (NRRL 599) to yield 11-epi-artemisinin, 9b-hydroxydeoxy-11-epi-arte- misinin, and 9b-hydroxy-11-epi-artemisinin [27]. Microbial transformation of the germacranolide parthenolide using A. niger (NRRL 599) and A. ochraceous (NRRL 2295) yiel- ded 11bH-dihydroparthenolide [11]. A. terreus (IFO6123) transformed dehydrocostuslactone into two derivatives, 11a,13-dihydrodehydrocostuslactone and 16-(1-methyl-1- propenyl)eremantholide [13]. Cultures of two strains of A. niger (AS 3.1858 and VKM F-1119) transformed one of the most important STLs, artemisinin,into four hydroxylated products, 3b-hydrodeoxyartemisinin, 1a-hydroxyartemisi- nin, 5b-hydroxyartemisinin, and 7b-hydroxyartemisinin [28, 39]. According to the literature, the main enzymatic reactions of STLs that are able to be catalyzed by Aspergillus Fig. 1 Proposal of biotransformation of 1 into 2 by A. terreus MT 5.3 (adapted from Spring et al. [38]) 1720 J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 123 species are hydrogenation, hydroxylation, reduction, and acetylation. Thus, with the aims of obtaining new, potentially bio- active compounds, and giving insights into the new meta- bolic reactions of STLs, we carried out the biotransformation of tagitinin C (1, Fig. 1) by the fungus Aspergillus terreus MT 5.3. Materials and methods Isolation of tagitinin C (1) Leaves of Tithonia diversifolia (400 g) were collected by B. A. Rocha, in May 2007, in Ribeira˜o Preto, Brazil. The material was identiﬁed by F. B. Da Costa, and a voucher specimen was deposited in the SPFR Herbarium, Depart- ment of Biology, Ribeira˜o Preto, SP, University of Sa˜o Paulo, under the number FBC #126. Air-dried entire leaves were rinsed for a few seconds with dichloromethane, for dissolution of the glandular trichomes [2], thereby yielding 5 g of a yellow crude extract after ﬁltration with common ﬁlter paper and solvent evaporation under reduced pres- sure. The dry residue was re-suspended in MeOH/H2O (7:3, v/v) and extracted with n-hexane followed by dichloromethane. After solvent evaporation, the dichloro- methane layer was fractionated over silica gel 60H (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7736) by vacuum liquid chromatography [9] using increasing amounts of ethyl acetate in n-hexane, thereby yielding nine fractions of 250 ml each. The tagi- tinin C-rich fractions (3 and 4) (1.5 g, conﬁrmed by infrared spectroscopy, TLC, and reversed-phase HPLC analysis, as well as comparison with an authentic sample [2]) were puriﬁed by centrifugal chromatography (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7749; 4 mm thickness; n-hexane/diethyl ether/ethyl acetate 6:3:1 v/v as eluent; ﬂow rate 2 ml/min; UV lamp 254 nm). For ﬁnal puriﬁcation, preparative TLC was used (silica gel PF254, Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730; 1 mm thickness; n-hexane/ethyl acetate/ chloroform 5:3:2 v/v, and 2 % acetic acid as eluent). The isolated compound (1, 200 mg) was analyzed by HPLC and 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to check its purity before the biotransformation procedure. The 1H NMR spectral data of compounds (1 and 2) were in accordance with those reported [2]. Biotransformation procedure and analysis Screening was performed on a small scale (30 ml of fer- mentation medium in 125-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks) to select efﬁcient conditions for the biotransformation of 1. The trials for screening procedures were performed as previ- ously described by Krishna-Kumari et al. [17]. A. terreus MT 5.3 was cultivated in malt extract medium and incu- bated at 30 �C for 7 days to obtain spores. After that, the spores were harvested using a 2 % Tween 80 aqueous solution and counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer. The pre-fermentative medium was inoculated with 1 9 107 spores/ml and incubated with agitation (150 rpm) at 30 �C for 48 h. The resulting mycelium was harvested, rinsed with sterilized H2O, and transferred to fresh Czapek med- ium (initial pH 6.0). The culture was then incubated under the same conditions for 10 days. After 24 h, 0.1 mg/ml of 1, which had been previously dissolved in dimethyl sulf- oxide (3 mg dissolved in 300 ll), was added to the culture medium. Control ﬂasks contained culture medium with the fungus but without 1, culture medium with the fungus and dimethyl sulfoxide and without 1, culture medium with 1 and without the fungus, or only the culture medium. A time course study was carried out as follows. One Erlenmeyer ﬂask was taken every 24 h; the product was extracted with dichloromethane, and then analyzed by TLC to check the degree of transformation of compound 1. TLC was carried out on silica gel GF254 (Merck, Brazil, cat. no. 7730) plates (0.25 mm thickness, 20 9 20 cm), and the spots were visualized after spraying the plates with vanillin/sulfuric acid (1 % H2SO4 in ethanol). Thirty milligrams of 1 was used for the preparative- scale incubation with A. terreus MT 5.3 for 120 h, at 150 rpm, and 30 �C. The culture broth was ﬁltered using ﬁlter paper and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under a vacuum. The resulting residue (45 mg) was subjected to separation by HPLC in a Shimadzu SCL 10Avp liquid chromatograph with an SPD-M10Avp photodiode array detector (Japan) using a C-18 column (Shimadzu, Japan, ODS Shim-pack 5 lm, 4.6 9 250 mm; ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min; DAD detection). The main metabolite (2, 4 mg) was puriﬁed after repe- ated injections according to the following gradient: 0.1 min 20 % MeCN, 35 min 60 % MeCN, 38 min 100 % MeCN, 43 min 100 % MeCN, 48 min 20 % MeCN, and 53 min 20 % MeCN. Compounds 1 and 2 were observed at retention times of 24 and 29 min, respectively (UV detection set at 210 nm). Comparison of the HPLC proﬁles of the controls with those bio- transformed ensured that 1 had been converted to 2 through microbial catalysis. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined by HR-ESIMS, 1D- and 2D-NMR techniques, and com- parison of the spectroscopic data with an authentic sample and published data [2]. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker (Germany) DPX 500 spectrometer (500 MHz for 1H). Samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform with tetramethylsilane as internal reference. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Aldrich (USA). High-resolution mass J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 1721 123 spectra were recorded on a UltrOTOFq-ESI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Microorganism Aspergillus terreus MT 5.3 was isolated from soil in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, and identiﬁed by C. M. S. Motta from ‘‘Colec¸a˜o de Culturas–Micoteca URM–Depart- amento de Micologia/CCB-UFP’’, Av. Prof. Nelson Chaves s/no., Cidade Universita´ria, 50670-420, Recife, Brazil. The fungus was maintained by periodic transfers on PDA at 8 �C. The microorganism A. terreus MT 5.3 was deposited in the collection ‘‘Colec¸a˜o de Culturas Tropicais’’ (Tropical Culture Collection) of Andre´ Tosello Foundation (www. fat.org.br), under accession number CCT-7640. Cytotoxicity assay Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell viability was assessed by MTT (3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, as described by Mossman [23]. The MTT (Sigma, USA) solution at a ﬁnal concentration of 500 lg/ml was added to the culture medium 4 h before the end of the treatment, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 ll of dimethyl sulfoxide to the cell culture. For cell treatment we used compounds 1 and 2, at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 lg/ml. Non- treated culture cells were used as a negative control, and cyclophosphamide was used as a positive control. Statis- tical analysis was performed by Student’s t test; and Dunnett’s test was used for multiple comparisons. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁ- cant. Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Results and discussion The transformation of 1 by A. terreus MT 5.3 yielded the unusual STL 2 as the main compound. This was identiﬁed as 1-methoxy-3-hydroxy-3,10b-4,5a-diepoxy-8b-isobuty- royloxygermacr-11(13)-en-6a,12-olide. The 1H NMR spectral data of 1 and 2 are shown in Table 1. Although several researchers worldwide have chemically investi- gated T. diversifolia, compound 2 was isolated only from a Brazilian population [2]. As already mentioned, it should be emphasized that the main enzymatic reactions that Aspergillus promotes in STLs are hydrogenation, hydrox- ylation, reduction, and acetylation [6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 27, 29, 31, 39, 40]. Interestingly, we have uncovered an unu- sual epoxidation between C4 and C5; a methoxy group was added at C1, and a C1,C10 ether bridge was formed in the 10-membered ring of 1. Nevertheless, the exocyclic double bond at C11–C13 was preserved. Compound 2 was recently isolated from a rinse extract of the inﬂorescences of Brazilian T. diversifolia [2]. Although its chemical structure is already known, this is the ﬁrst time that 2 has been obtained as a microbial biotransformation product. An interesting observation is that the Aspergillus strain used in our work was able to catalyze chemical reactions that mimicked those which occur inside the glandular trichomes from the inﬂorescences of T. diversifolia. Glandular tric- homes of Asteraceae species are the places where the biosynthesis of STLs usually occurs, and possibly where 1 is converted to 2. Thus, this fungus can be used as an alternative means of gaining 2 from 1, therefore conﬁrming the potential of biotransformation of natural compounds by microorganisms, as well as their ability to mimic plant biosynthetic pathways [34]. Spring et al. [38] reported the isolation of a closely related analogue of 1 from Viguiera quinqueremis (Aster- aceae), and proposed its conversion to the hemiketal form, such as 1b depicted in Fig. 1. The structural differences between the previously reported analogue and 1 are the nature of the C8 side-chain ester (methylbutyrate instead of isobutyrate) and the presence of a hydroxyl group at C15. The authors also discussed a spontaneous methoxylation of the 1a analogue at C1 in the presence of MeOH, thereby leading to the formation of an analogue of 1b (Fig. 1) [38]. Thus, it could be argued in our work that 2 is a compound produced by A. terreus starting from 1b, an artifact that had Table 1 1H NMR spectral data of compounds 1 and 2 (500 MHz, CDCl3, J in Hz) H 1 2 1 6.93 d (16.9) 3.99 dd (6.7, 10.4) 2a 6.26 d (16.9) 2.57 dd (6.7, 12.5) 2b – 1,93 dd (10.7, 12.6) 5 5.88 d (9.0) 3.33 s 6 5.41 d (9.0) 5.13 dd (4.65) 7 3.55 m 4.33 dddd 8 5.33 ddd (3.2, 6.0, 10.0) 5.53 ddd (4.2; 7.1, 11.0) 9a 2.40 dd (6.0, 13.8) 1.74 dd (11.1, 14.7) 9b 2.00 dd (10.0, 13.8) 1.66 dd (4.8, 14.7) 13a 6.36 d (1.7) 6.29 dd (2.8) 13b 5.81 d (1.8) 5.62 dd (2.3) 14 1.53 s 1.50 s 15 1.95 s 1.44 s 20 2.44 sept 2.41 sept 30 1.06 d (7.1) 1.05 d (7.0) 40 1.03 d (7.1) 1.04 d (7.0) –OMe – 3.35 s 1722 J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol (2012) 39:1719–1724 123 originated from 1 in the presence of MeOH. Nevertheless, a spontaneous interconversion where 1 was converted to 1b would never occur in methods such as ours, because MeOH was not used in any step of the experimental procedure, either for isolation, analysis, or structure elucidation of 1. Compound 2 is therefore a natural product obtained by biotransformation of 1. In addition, the crude extract from the leaves of T. diversifolia used in this work had been screened for the presence of 2 by HPLC–DAD analysis, and it was not detected even as a trace. According to Barrero et al. [6], epoxidation and hydro- genation reactions of the exocyclic double bond at C11– C13 seem to be the most common processes in the microbial transformation of STLs by ﬁlamentous fungi. In order to explain the formation of the epoxide group between C4 and C5 in the biotransformed molecule 2 as well as the methoxylation of C1, we followed the proposal of Onken and Berger [26]. The authors state that terpenoids are preferentially dissolved in the cell membranes of fungi, thereby inducing changes in properties of the membrane and causing toxicity. Fungi react against these effects and co-metabolize compounds to others that are more water soluble, thus showing that the enzyme systems involved in this process of detoxiﬁcation are comparable to those of other eukaryotic cells. In the ﬁrst step, monooxygenases of cytochrome P450 catalyze the oxyfunctionalization of the molecules [12, 22]. Then, in the second step, more water- soluble products are formed by the action of hydrolases or conjugation by glutathione S-transferases [6, 12]. Thus, the biotransformation of 1 leading to 2 might be part of a detoxiﬁcation process created by the fungus. The cytotoxicity bioassay was designed to observe whether 1 and 2 could elicit cell death at the selected concentrations. Both compounds showed cytotoxic effects on HL-60 cells lines comparable to that of the positive control, which was statistically signiﬁcant when compared with the negative control (p \ 0.05). The results indicated that 1 and 2 have cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells at the lowest tested doses. Similar results were found while using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where 1 and 2 also presented cytotoxic effects, thus indicating non- selective toxicity. It has previously been shown that 1 has cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells [19], but its activity has not yet been compared with that of the derivative 2. In the same work, compound 1b was isolated from T. diver- sifolia as a natural compound and was found to be approximately 10 times more active than 1. In our work, compound 2, a C4–C5 epoxy derivative of 1b, had a sta- tistically similar activity to 1. Kupchan et al. [18] demonstrated that the in vitro cytotoxicity of STLs against human carcinoma was dependent on the presence of the a-methylene-c-lactone moiety. Moreover, evaluation of the cytotoxic activities of further derivatives indicated which functional groups con- tributed to the activity. So-called active functional groups have therefore been proposed for several STLs. It has been veriﬁed, for example, that an extra a,b-unsaturated moiety contributed to enhancing the activity of STLs with the a-methylene-c-lactone group, whereas the compounds containing only this additional unsaturation did not present signiﬁcant activity [18]. In another study, it was conﬁrmed that among other structural and electronic factors, the a,b- unsaturated carbonyl structure elements (cyclopentenone and a-methylene-c-lactone) are correlated with cytotoxicity [36]. In our work, compound 1, containing three a,b- unsaturated moieties, had statistically similar activity to 2, with only one a,b-unsaturated moiety. This suggested therefore that its extra unsaturations were not important to the effect observed in HL-60 cells. In summary, we have observed that in the presence of compound 1, enzymes from A. terreus MT 5.3 were able to generate 2 in the same way as the enzymes located in the glandular trichomes of T. diversifolia. This fungus can thus be used as an alternative source of 2 because it mimics plant biosynthetic processes. The absence of two a,b- unsaturations in 2 did not improve or decrease its cytotoxic activity in the HL-60 cells when compared with 1. Finally, we suggest that the mammalian metabolism of 1 after oral consumption of preparations containing T. diversifolia leaves should be researched in future, because this STL may form toxic compounds when metabolized.
