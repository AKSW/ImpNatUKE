Abstract-20-Epiheynenine,  an epimer of the known iboga alkaloid heyneanine, is the major base of the root  bark of Peschiera afinis. It is accompanied by lesser quantities of coronaridine, coronaridine pseudoindoxyl, affini-  sine and olivacine, as well as sitosterol, fi-amyrin, lupeol and 3-0-acetyllupeol.  INTRODUCI-ION  Antitumor [l]  and spasmolytic [2] properties of a  crude extract and the major alkaloid [3] from the root  bark of Peschiera a&is  (Muell. Arg.) Mikrs (= Taber-  naemontana c&is  Muell. Arg., Apocynaceae Plumieroi-  deae) were reported. The fractionation of this extract has  now led to the terpenoids sitosterol, fl-amyrin, lupeol  and 3-O-acetyllupeol, besides the alkaloids coronaridine  [4], coronaridine  pseudoindoxyl,  whose natural occur-  r-  was anticipated  [S], afIinisine [6] and olivacine  [7]. The major alkaloid was characterized  as 2O-epi-  heyneanine (lb).  (lalR=Mc,  R’=H  (1 b) R = H,  I?‘= Me  RESULTS  The molecular formula Cz1H,,N,03,  determined by  high resolution MS, the qualitative composition  of the  low resolution MS Fable  1) and the UV of the major  alkaloid  were registered  previously  for heyneanine  (20-hydroxycoronaridine)  [89]. The mp, however, was  depressed upon admixture of an authentic sample, kindly  supplied by Dr. S. M. Kupchan,  and the IR spectra,  though very similar, were not superimposable. The sole  significant difference of the ‘HMR spectra (Table 2)  referred to the frequencies due to the protons of the side  chain. This is locked in a tixed conformation by the in-  tramolecular  hydrogen  bridge, whose existence  was  ascertained through the invariance of the IR 3470 cm- ’  band upon dilution in CHC13. Thus the substituents  at  * Present address: Departamento de Quimiea, Universidade  Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro.  C-20 are exposed to two possible environments,  accord-  ing to their con&nation.  The C&-20  MR signal of  heyneanine  and the H-20 signal of the novel isolate  appear upfield relative to the corresponding  signals of  the respective epimers. These substituents (R in 1) may  thus be located in the anisotropically  protected region  above the ring systems, as tentatively proposed in the  formulae la for heyneanine  and lb for epiheyneanine.  Mp’s, as well as UV, IR, ‘HMR and MS, of four ad-  ditional alkaloids were identical with lit. data for cor-  onaridine [4,10], coronaridine pseudoindoxyl  [S], afTi&  sine [6,11] and olivacine [7,12]. The identification of cor-  onaridine was confirmed by saponification  of the base  with KOH followed by decarboxylation in HCl to iboga-,  mine [4], compared with an authentic  sample kindly  supplied by Dr. E. Wenkert. The identification of affini-  sine and of olivacine was confirmed by direct comparison  with authentic samples kindly supplied, respectively, by  Dr. M. P. Cava and Dr. C. W. Mosher.  DISCUSRION  The major alkaloids of P. afinis are, according to pre-  vious work [6,11], of the vobasine (vobasine and ffiine)  and the sarpagine (a@nisine) types. In contrast, P. lundii  @. C.)

Thus, it appeared to the authors [S] that P. lundii might  be better  viewed as a Tabernaemontana species than as  a species of Peschieru. The present reinvestigation  of  P. a&is, however, again revealed the presence of iboga  alkaloids (20_epiheyneanine, coronaridine,  coronaridine  pseudoindoxyl) and olivacine in the genus Peschiera, and  confirmed the presence of afhnisine. This seems to sug-  gest that the indicated chemical differences are of little  systematic significance. It should, neverthelesq  not be  forgotten that the close botanical  relationship between  these two genera has often led to confusion and either  generic name has been assigned to a species, according  to a botanist’s individual preferences [5].  Furthermore,  the previous study on P. afinis [11]  employed an EtOH extract of the “whole plant” in which  our root bark constituents could have played a relatively  minor role and escaped detection. Both analyses refer  to specimens collected in north-eastern  Brazil. This ori-  gin eliminates doubts about correctness of identifications  of the plant material. P. a&is  is one of the more fre-  quent and characteristic  shrubs of the sandy plateaus  around  Fortaleza  and no other species of these two  genera is known to grow in Ceara State. The identifica-  tion was based on studies by Adolf0 Ducke [13], and  confirmed by Dr. C. M. Barroso (Rio de Janeiro Botani-  cal Garden) and Dr. J. Monachino (New York Botanical  Garden).  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation of the constituents. Dry pow&red  root bark (200  g) was percolated successively with hexane and @I N HCl.  The hexane soln was evap. and the residue (3 g) extd. with  hot MeOH. The MeGH soln. was evap. and the residue (420  mg) separated by SiO, column chromatography  into a solid  hydrocarbon,  sitosterol, /%amyrin, lupeol and 3-O-acetyllu-  peal. The HCl soln. was basified with N&OH.  The ppt. (9.1  g) was separated by centrifugation  and extd  with C6H6-  MeOH (3 : 1). Evap. of the solvent gave a residue (6.5 g) which  . .  -._  .  was separated by StO, column chromatography into fractions  Ai, A2 and Aa. A, (1 g) was separated by PLC (SiOz) into  sitosterol, 3-0-acetyllupeol,  lupeol and an alkaloid mixture.  The mixture, in anh. C&e-Et,O,  was treated with dry HCl  gas. The ppt. was collected and separated into the chlorohyd-  rates of coronaridine,  mp 225-227” dec. (lit. f41 235” dec.),  and coronaridine  pseudoindoxyl,  mp 2&Y -d&z. (lit.
