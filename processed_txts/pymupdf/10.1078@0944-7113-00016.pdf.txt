� Introduction The subtribe Pilocarpinae (Rutoideae) is distributed throughout the American continent and includes the genus Raulinoa, first described by R. S. Cowan in 1960 (Cowan and Smith, 1973). This genus is monospecific and endemic to one region in Itajaí Valley, Santa Catari- na, Brazil. Raulinoa echinata is a perennial woody shrub showing a high degree of adaptation to the rocky margins of the Itajaí river. As part of our interest in bioactive nat- ural products, in this paper we describe the isolation, identification, antitrypanosomal activity, brine shrimp lethality, and antimicrobial activity of crude extracts and nine compounds from Raulinoa echinata. This is the first time that this species has been investigated. � Material and methods Plant material Stems and leaves of R. echinata were collected in Ibi- rama, SC, Brazil and identified by A. Reis (Universi- 0944-7113/01/08/02-121 $ 15.00/0 dade Federal de Santa Catarina) and J. R. Pirani (Uni- versidade de São Paulo). Voucher specimens [A. Reis & M. Biavatti 2.570 (26/07/98)] were deposited at the Herbário Barbosa Rodrigues (HBR), Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil. General experimental procedures A Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C was used. The EIMS were obtained on a VG-Platform II mass spec- trometer (70 eV). Optical rotations were measured using a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. HPLC separa- tions were performed using a Shimadzu LC 8A pump [2.5 ml/min flow; Shandon Hypersil (5 µm) silica gel (35 cm × 1.2 cm i.d.) column; UV-VIS detector at 330 and 220 nm; and hexane-acetone (8:2) as eluent].  Extraction and Isolation The dried and powdered stems (5 kg) were extracted with hexane and methanol.

The hexane extract and some of these com- pounds were assayed in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Brine shrimp lethality and antimicrobial activities of the crude extract and pure compounds were also evaluated.

These fractions were biomonitored and separated over sílica gel (230–400 mesh) using vary- ing ratios of hexane-acetone as eluent. The hexane subfraction furnished germacrene D (6) (25 mg) and squalene (20 mg). From the dichloromethane subfrac- tion, isomultiflorenol (7) and isobauerenol (8) (mix- ture, 200 mg), friedelin (9) (10 mg), and β-sitosterol (100 mg) were obtained. The ethyl acetate subfraction yielded interesting fractions (denominated D, E, and F) when fractionated over Florisil (100–200 mesh). Fractions D (40 mg) and E (19 mg) were separated by preparative HPLC. Fraction D afforded 20 mg of 3- (1’-1’-dimethylallyl)-lomatin (1), and the E fraction furnished 1β,6α-dihydroxy-4-(15)-eudesmene (4) (9 mg). From silica gel fractionation of fraction F, melianone (2) (26 mg), melianodiol (3) (23 mg), and oplopanone (5) (18 mg) were isolated. Bioactivity screening In vitro trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi (Y strain) and brine shrimp lethality (BSL) assays were performed according to established protocols (Alves et al. 1999; Alkofahi et al. 1989). Agar diffusion and minimal in- hibitory concentration (MIC) methods (Bauer et al. 1996; Washington and Sutter, 1980) were used to eval- uate the antimicrobial activity of the fractions and compounds against the following microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis (CCT 2471), B. cereus (CCT 1436), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442), Escherichia coli (CCT 1457), and Micrococcus roseus (CCT 1469). � Discussion The bioassay results for the extract, fractions, and iso- lates are shown in Table 1. The pyranocoumarin 3-(1’- 1’-dimethylallyl)-lomatin (1) is known only as product of synthesis. This is the first report of its isolation as  a single enantiomer natural product displaying inter- esting in vitro activity against T. cruzi (IC50 =  0.14 µg/ml). This compound was characterized by spectral data and literature comparison (Salvá et al. 1990). The absolute (S)-configuration of 1 [[α]D = +12.7 (c 0.04; CHCl3)] was determined by the Mosher method for secondary alcohols (Preite, 1994).  Brine shrimp bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of the known cytotoxic protolimonoid melianone, identified through comparison of its spec- tral data with the literature (Itokawa et al. 1992; Nakanishi et al. 1986) (2), which showed an IC50 value of 38 µg/ml corroborating that BSL is a good pre- screen test for cytotoxicity. The results obtained here also reinforce the feasibility of the brine shrimp lethal- ity bioassay as a pre-screen system to detect extracts active against T. cruzi, as suggested by Alves et al. (1999). Melianodiol(3) (LD50 value = 2.6 µg/ml), also identified through comparison of its spectral data with the literature (Merrien and Polonsky, 1971), was less active than 2 (LD50 value = 41 µg/ml). All extracts and pure compounds tested for antimi- crobial activity were inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Among the microor- ganisms and compounds assayed, only B. subtilis, B. cereus, S. aureus and M. roseus were inhibited signifi- cantly by melianodiol (3) at 100 µg/ml; this compound showed a good diffusion on agar media, presenting ac- tivity against Gram-positive bacteria. These results are presented in Table 1. The MIC of melianodiol (3) was 50 µg/ml against B. subtilis and B. cereus and  25 µg/ml against S. aureus and M. roseus. Germacrene D (6) is frequently found in Rutaceae species; its prevalent occurrence may be significant in the communication between the plant and its environ- ment, possibly as an insecticide (Marr and Tang, 1992). Germacrene D, identified through comparison of its spectral data with the literature (Kubeczka, 1979), showed a moderate in vitro trypanocidal activi- ty (IC50 value = 0.135 µg/ml), considering the refer- ence chemoprophylatic drug crystal violet (IC50 value of 7.5 µg/ml). Compound 1β,6α-dihydroxy-4-(15)-eu- desmene (4) (Gutierrez and Herz, 1988) and oplopanone (5) (Herz and Watanabe, 1983) were char- acterized by comparison of their spectral data with the literature. This is the first report of these sesquiter- penes from Rutaceae. They did not display any signifi- cant activity on the models tested. The pentacyclic triterpenes isobauerenol (7) and iso- multiflorenol (8) were inactive in all bioassays. Isolat- ed as a mixture, these compounds were identified by comparison of 1H and 13C NMR, and EIMS data with literature values (Olea and Roque, 1990; Tanaka and Matsunaga, 1988). Friedelin (9) was also inactive and was identified based on comparison of 1H NMR and 13C NMR literature data (Ahmad and Rahman, 1994). Pentacyclic triterpenes are not common in the Ru- taceae, but compound 9 has also been reported from the Rutoideae (Dreyer et al. 1972). It was observed that the crude extract presented in- creased activities when fractionated for BSL and an- timicrobial activity. The fractions obtained were less active for trypanocidal activity than the crude extract.  The results obtained in this study indicated the inter- esting phytochemical potential of Raulinoa echinata. Compounds 1 and 6 showed considerable activity against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, was com- pared with crystal violet. Based on these results, it is possible to drive future research toward new bioactive Chemistry and bioactivity of Raulinoa echinata Cowan 123 compounds, selecting active structural classes for syn- thetic or phytochemical survey.
