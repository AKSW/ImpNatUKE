So,  it  has  been  considered  as  a  potential  drug  candidate. In  the  early  drug  development  process,  drug  metabolism  is  one  of  the  main  parameters  that  should  be evaluated;  therefore,  the  biotransformation  of  this  lignan  by  rat  liver  microsomes  was  investigated  for  the ﬁrst  time.  In  order  to  perform  the  biotransformation  study  and  to determine  the  kinetic  parameters,  a  sim- ple,  sensitive  and  selective  HPLC  method  was  developed  and  fully  validated.  After  method  validation,  the biotransformation  study  was  accomplished  and  the  kinetic  parameters  were  determined.  The  biotrans- formation  study  obeyed  the  Michaelis–Menten  kinetics.  The  Vmax and  Km were  1.46  ±  0.034  �mol/mg protein/h  and  8.99  ± 0.488  �M, respectively.  In  addition,  the  formation  of  dihydro-grandisin,  character- ized  by  GC–MS,  by  mammalian  systems  indicated  the involvement  of  a  CYP450  enzyme  type. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This  compound  has  displayed  different  biologi- cal  properties,  such  as  larvicidal  activity  against  the  mosquito Aedes  aegypti  [4],  trypanocidal  activity  against  the  trypamastig- ote  form  of  Trypanossoma  cruzi  [5–7], and  antinociceptive  and anti-inﬂammatory  activities  [8].  In  the  last  years,  many  studies  on cytotoxicity  and  antitumoral  activity  showed  that  (−)-grandisin  is a  potential  candidate  as  an  anticancer  agent  [9–11]. The  oxidative  metabolism  has  been  extensively  investigated  in the  last  two  decades  by  means  of  biological  simulating  models, using  perfused  organs,  isolated  cells  or  cell  fragments  (micro- somes)  [12]. Its  importance  lies  on  the  fact  that  the  drug  candidates, before  the  ﬁnal  developmental  steps  as  drugs,  must  be  evaluated  as ∗ Corresponding  author  at:  Faculdade  de  Filosoﬁa,  Ciências  e Letras  de  Ribeirão Preto,  USP,  Av.

In  addition,  the  knowledge  on  interactions  of new  drug  candidates  towards  oxidative  enzymes,  their  afﬁnity  and speed  of  metabolism  is  of  fundamental  importance,  particularly when  investigations  of  drug  interactions  is  concerned. The  in  vivo  study  of  hepatic  metabolism  can  be  estimated  from the  “turnover”  or  intrinsic  clearance,  derived  from  in  vitro  tissue preparations.  Species-speciﬁc  metabolism  allows  for  the  extrapola- tion  from  animals  to  humans  with  an  additional  level  of  assurance. Since  human  studies  are  generally  impractical,  unethical,  or  too costly,  in  vitro  systems  are  the  most  relevant  way  to  compare metabolic  rates  between  species.  To  best  utilize  this  approach,  the mechanism  needs  to  be  conserved  across  species.  For  metabolism studies,  the  enzymatic  processes  need  to  be  qualitatively  the  same [13].  Many  laboratories  have  used  liver  microsomes  to  perform such  metabolism  studies.  Hepatic  microsomes  are  a  ﬂexible  sys- tem,  are  a  straightforward  preparation  and  they  can  be  stored, with  long-term  availability  [12].  They  probably  represent  one  of  the most  widely  used  in  vitro  system  for  investigating  the  metabolic proﬁle  of  a  new  drug  candidate  [14,15]. The  recent  appreciation of  the  metabolism  study  became  apparent  that  understanding the  fundamental  properties  of  the  enzyme  kinetics  of  cytochrome 0731-7085/$  –  see  front  matter ©    2012 Elsevier B.V.

Chemical  structure  of  the  lignan  (−)-grandisin. P450,  and  thus  the  rate  of  biotransformation  of  a  new  drug  can- didate,  becomes  a  parameter  of  crucial  importance  in  shaping  the therapeutic  proﬁle  [16].  The  advantages  arising  from  these  studies are  mainly  to  provide  information  on  the  biochemical  characteris- tics  of  a  new  drug  candidate  substance  increasing  the  relevance  for future  clinical  studies  [17]. Due  to  the  potential  of  (−)-grandisin  as  a  new  lead  compound mainly  against  cancer,  the  aim  of  this  paper  was  to  characterize  its metabolism  employing  rat  liver  microsomal  fraction  (a  mammalian species)  by  evaluating  the  Michaelis–Menten  kinetics  parameters (Vmax, Km),  the  intrinsic  clearance  (CLint) and  the  formation  of metabolites. 2.  Experimental 2.1.  Chemical  and  reagents The  tetrahydrofuran  lignan  (−)-grandisin  used  in  the  present work  was  extracted  and  puriﬁed  from  Piper  solmsianum  (Piper- aceae)  according  to  previous  procedures  [18]. Standard  stock solution  of  the  lignan  (−)-grandisin  was  prepared  at  the  concen- tration  of  1.15  mmol  L−1 in  methanol.  Calibration  curve  solutions of  the  lignan  (−)-grandisin  in  the  range  of  0.00115–1.15  mmol  L−1 were  obtained  by  dilutions  in  the  same  solvent  mixture.  These solutions  were  stored  at  −20 ◦C  and  protected  from  light.  HPLC grade  methanol,  acetonitrile,  hexane,  were  purchased  from  Merck (Darmstadt,  Germany)  and  from  J.T.  Baker  (Philipsburg,  NJ,  USA). Sodium  chloride  and  sodium  dihydrogen  phosphate  were  obtained from  Merck  (Darmstadt,  Germany).  Sodium  hydroxide  and  potas- sium  chloride  were  obtained  from  Nuclear  (São  Paulo,  SP,  Brazil). Glycerol  and  Tris  (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane  were  obtained from  J.T.  Baker  (Phillipsburg,  NJ,  USA),  ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  (EDTA)  from  Carlo  Erba  (Milan,  Italy)  and  hydrochloric acid  was  obtained  from  Chemco  (Campinas,  SP,  Brazil).  NADP+, glucose-6-phosphate  and  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase were  obtained  from  Sigma–Aldrich  (St.  Louis,  MO,  USA). 2.2.  HPLC  conditions Chromatographic  analyzes  were  conducted  using  a  Shimadzu (Kyoto,  Japan)  liquid  chromatography  equipped  with  an  LC10-AD VP  solvent  pump  unit,  an  SCL-10A  VP  system  controller,  a  CTO- 10AS  VP  column  oven  and  an  SPD-M10A  VP  diode  array  detector operating  in  the  range  of  200–400  nm.  Injections  were  performed manually  through  a  50  �L loop  with  a  Rheodyne  model  7725i injector  (Rheodyne,  Cotati,  CA,  USA).  Data  were  collected  using the  Class  VP  software  (Shimadzu,  Kyoto,  Japan).  The  resolution  of the  lignan  (−)-grandisin  was  performed  at  25 ◦C  on  a  Kromasil® C18  column,  5  �m  particle  size  (250  mm ×  4.6  mm,  Eka  Chemicals, Bohus,  Sweden).  A  C18  column  (4.6  mm ×  12.5  mm,  5  �m  particle size,  Merck,  Darmstadt,  Germany)  was  used  as  guard  column.  The mobile  phase  was  a  mixture  of  acetonitrile:water  (60:40,  v/v)  and the  ﬂow  rate  was  1  mL  min−1. 2.3.  Extraction  procedure  and  method  validation To  extract  the  lignan  from  the  rat  liver  microsomes  it  was employed  a  liquid–liquid  extraction  as  sample  preparation.  The extraction  was  performed  employing  4  mL  hexane.  The  samples were  shaked  for  10  min  in  a  Vibrax  VXR  (IKA,  Staufen,  Germany) and  then  centrifuged  for  5  min  at  2860  ×  g.  The  supernatant  was collected  (3  mL)  and  let  to  evaporate  to  dryness  under  a  gently stream  of  compressed  air.  After  that,  the  residue  was  reconsti- tuted  in  100  �L  of  the  mobile  phase  and  50  �L  was  injected  in  the chromatography  system. The  linearity  of  the  method  was  performed  in  triplicate  and the  results  were  weighted  by  1/x2. The  results  of  the  linearity were  weighted  because  the  residual  analysis  of  the  analytical curve  showed  a  heteroscedasticity  behavior  [19].  Calibration  curves (n  =  3)  were  obtained  by  spiking  aliquots  of  1.0  mL  drug-free  rat microsomes  samples  with  standard  solutions  of  the  (−)-grandisin. The  ﬁnal  concentration  range  in  the  rat  microsomes  was  0.028,  0.57, 1.44,  2.31,  5.78  and  28.93  �M.  In  addition,  the  linearity  of  the  cali- bration  curve  was  assessed  by  ANOVA  Lack  of  ﬁt  test  using  a  p  value of  0.05.  MINITAB  Release,  version  14.1  (State  College,  PA,  USA)  was used  to  perform  the  statistical  analysis. The  limit  of  quantiﬁcation  was  deﬁned  as  the  lowest  concentra- tion  that  could  be  determined  with  accuracy  and  precision  below 20%  [20]  over  ﬁve  analytical  run  and  it  was  obtained  using  rat microsomes  samples  (1.0  mL)  spiked  with  0.028  �M  of  the  lignan. Precision  was  expressed  as  relative  standard  deviation  (RSD%)  and accuracy  as  percent  of  deviation  between  the  true  and  the  mea- sured  value.  To  assess  within-day  precision  and  accuracy,  replicate analyzes  (n  =  5)  of  1.0  mL  of  rat  microsomes  spiked  at  concen- trations  of  0.57,  5.78  and  23.14  �M  of  the  (−)-grandisin  were performed.  For  between-day  assays,  quintuplicate  rat  microsome samples  of  each  concentration  were  analyzed  for  three  consecutive days  (n  =  3)  [20]. The  absolute  recovery  of  the  lignan  (−)-grandisin extracted  from  the  rat  microsome  samples  spiked  with  the  concen- trations  of  0.057,  2.89  and  17.3  �M  (n  =  3,  for  each  concentration), was  determined  using  calibration  curves  obtained  from  the  data of  the  analytes  not  submitted  to  extraction.  The  recovery  was expressed  as  percentage  of  the  amount  extracted  and  the  relative standard  deviation  was  evaluated.  The  selectivity  of  the  method was  assured  by  analyzing  standard  solutions  of  some  reagents that  are  employed  in  the  in  vitro  metabolism  experiment.  These reagents  were  tested  employing  a  concentration  of  0.1  mg  mL−1. Drug-free  rat  microsome  samples  were  also  analyzed  to  assess  the capacity  of  sample  pretreatment  to  eliminate  matrix  interference. Short-term  stability  test  at  37 ◦C  and  at  room  temperature  was determined  (n  =  6).  Aliquots  of  rat  liver  microsomes  spiked  with low  (0.57  �M)  and  high  concentration  (23.14  �M)  of  (−)-grandisin were  prepared  and  kept  at  37 ◦C  under  water  bath  during  120  min. The  samples  were  prepared  and  kept  in  the  laboratory  during  6  h  to perform  the  room  temperature  stability.  The  lignan  (−)-grandisin peak  area  obtained  from  stability  tests  was  compared  with  the  peak area  obtained  with  freshly  prepared  samples.  One-way  ANOVA  was applied,  with  the  level  of  signiﬁcance  set  at  p  ≤  0.05. 2.4.  Animals  and  microsomal  preparation Male  Wistar  rats  weighting  180–220  g  were  obtained  from  Fac- ulty  of  Pharmaceutical  Sciences  of  Ribeirão  Preto  –  University  of São  Paulo  (Ethical  Approval  no.  10.1.848.53.2).  Animals  were  fed in  a  normal  condition  and  acclimatized  at  12  h  light/dark  cycle. The  animals  were  sacriﬁced  by  decapitation  and  the  livers  were removed  and  placed  in  ice-cold  0.05  mol  L−1 Tris–HCl  buffer  (pH 7.4),  containing  0.15  mol  L−1 KCl.  The  livers  were  minced  with scissors  and  washed  three  times  with  Tris–HCl  buffer.  After  that, the  slices  were  homogenated  with  MA  181  potter  equipment 242 G.B.  Messiano  et  al.  / Journal  of  Pharmaceutical  and  Biomedical  Analysis  72 (2013) 240–  244 (Marconi,  Piracicaba,  SP,  Brazil).  The  homogenate  was  centrifuged in  a  HIMAC  CF  15D2  centrifuge  (Hitachi,  Tokyo,  Japan)  at  10,000  ×  g for  20  min  at  4 ◦C  and  the  resulting  supernatant  was  ultracen- trifuged  employing  a  XL-70  Beckman  ultracentrifuge  (Beckman, Carlsbad,  CA,  USA)  at  100,000  ×  g  for  60  min  at  4 ◦C  in  order  to obtain  the  microsomal  pellet.  The  obtained  pellet  was  resuspended in  0.05  mol  L−1 HEPES–HCl  buffer  (pH  7.4),  containing  20%  glycerol and  0.001  mol  L−1 EDTA  and  stored  at  −70 ◦C  until  use.  The  protein concentration  was  determinated  by  the  biuret  method  using  a  BCA kit  (Labtest,  MG,  Brazil). 2.5.  Microsomal  incubation  conditions The  optimal  conditions  for  microsomal  incubation  were  deter- mined  in  the  linear  range  for  the  disappearance  of  (−)-grandisin from  the  medium.  Incubations  were  performed  in  quintuplicate (n  =  5)  with  the  reconstituted  rat  liver  microsomes  in  10  mL  amber tubes,  using  a  shaking  water  bath  at  37 ◦C.  The  incubation  mix- ture  consisted  of  a  cofactor  solution,  microsomal  preparation  (rat liver  microsomes),  phosphate  buffer  0.250  mol  L−1 pH  7.4  and substrate  (25  �L,  0.028–28.93  �M)  in  a  total  volume  of  1.0  mL. The  cofactor  solution  consisted  of  NADP+ (0.25  mM),  glucose-6- phosphate  (5  mM)  and  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (0.5 units)  in  Tris–HCl  buffer  (Tris–HCl  0.05  mol  L−1 –  KCl  0.15  mol  L−1, pH  7.4).  After  5  min  prewarmed  at  37 ◦C,  the  metabolic  reaction was  initiated  by  the  addition  of  the  rat  microsomal  preparation. The  microsomal  protein  concentration  was  evaluated  from  0.0  to 5.0  mg  protein  (0.0,  0.5,  1.0,  1.5,  2.0,  2.5,  3.0,  3.5,  4.0,  4.5  and  5.0  mg protein)  (n  =  5)  and  it  was  incubated  by  0–320  min  (0,  30,  60,  90, 120,  150,  180,  240,  280  and  320  min).  After  this  period,  the  reaction was  terminated  by  the  addition  of  hexane  (4.0  mL).  This  mixture was  agitated  for  10  min  in  a  Vibrax  VXR  agitator  and  then  cen- trifuged  for  5  min  at  4000  rpm.  Finally,  3.0  mL  of  the  supernatant was  collected  and  let  to  evaporate  until  complete  dryness  under compressed  air.  After  that,  the  residue  was  reconstituted  in  100  �L of  the  mobile  phase  and  50  �L was  injected  into  the  chromato- graphic  system.  Control  incubations  were  performed  in  the  absence of  cofactor  solution  and  in  the  absence  of  microsomal  preparation. The  difference  between  ‘with’  and  ‘without’  NADPH  was  considered as  CYP450-mediated  metabolism. 2.6.  Metabolism  data  analysis The  Michaelis–Menten  enzyme  kinetic  constants  (Vmax and  Km) for  the  lignan  (−)-grandisin  in  vitro  metabolism  were  calculated  by nonlinear  regression  using  Prism  Software  (5.0).  Furthermore,  the intrinsic  clearance  (CLint)  of  (−)-grandisin  in  rat  liver  microsomes was  calculated  based  on  the  ratio  of  Vmax to  Km. 2.7.  Structural  determination  of  the  metabolite  by  GC/MS Each  sample  analyzed  for  the  reaction,  total  of  three  samples, was  pooled  from  a  10  single  reactions  due  to  the  low  concentration of  the  substrate  and  consequently  of  the  possible  products.  The same  procedure  of  making  a  pool  was  performed  for  the  control, however  only  one  sample  was  analyzed.  After  dried  under  a  stream of  compressed  air,  the  samples  were  diluted  in  ethyl  acetate  to 1.0  mL  and  1.0  �L  was  injected  in  GC–MS.  The  sample  was  diluted  to avoid  any  overload  of  the  sample  into  the  GC  capillary  column.  The GC–MS  used  was  a  Shimadzu® model  QP2010  with  the  auto  sam- pler  and  auto  injector  model  AOC5000.  The  column  used  was  ZB-5 MS  (30  m  × 0.25  mm ×  0.25  �L,  Phenomenex,  Torrance,  CA,  USA). The  oven  temperature  was  programmed  as  to  start  the  temperature at  120 ◦C  for  4  min.  Then,  the  temperature  was  increased  at  the  rate 8 ◦C  min−1 until  300 ◦C  and  maintained  constant  for  more  12  min. Other  GC  parameters  were:  injector  temperature  at  250 ◦C,  column ﬂow  1.0  mL  min−1, and  linear  velocity  37.5  cm  s−1. The  injection proceeded  in  a  splitless  mode  with  1.0  min  of  sampling  time.  In the  MS,  the  ionization  by  electrons  was  done  using  energy  of  70  eV, ion  source  at  250 ◦C  and  acquisition  by  scan  from  m/z  40  to  500.  The interface  temperature  used  was  280 ◦C  and  the  solvent  delay  time was  4  min. 3.  Results  and  discussion 3.1.  Chromatographic  determination  and  method  validation The  method  used  to  determine  the  (−)-grandisin  metabolism was  validated  according  to  FDA  guidelines  for  the  analysis  of  drugs in  biological  ﬂuids  [20]. Since  there  is  not  any  ofﬁcial  guide  for  ana- lytical  method  validation  in  metabolism  studies,  it  was  decided to  follow  the  FDA  guideline  (at  least  partially)  due  to  the  char- acteristic  of  the  matrix  employed  in  this  study  (microsomes)  and due  to  the  high  degree  of  acceptability  of  this  guideline.  Method validation  is  an  important  step  in  the  development  of  any  study dedicated  to  quantiﬁcation.  At  this  stage,  it  is  possible  to  ﬁnd  out if  the  developed  method  is  suitable  for  the  desired  application and  to  come  across  analyte  characteristics,  such  as  its  stability under  different  conditions  that  can  affect  the  analytical  results.  The chromatographic  quantiﬁcation  was  carried  out  on  a  Kromasil® C18  column  using  a  mixture  of  acetonitrile:water  (60:40,  v/v)  as mobile  phase.  The  retention  time  of  the  (−)-grandisin  was  15.1  min under  this  condition.  The  proposed  method  showed  to  be  linear over  the  concentration  range  of  0.028–28.93  �M,  with  correla- tion  coefﬁcient  (r)  ≥  0.9955  and  y  =  1178993x  +  5094.  The  lack-of-ﬁt test  showed  that  the  analytical  curve  obeys  a  linear  model  with F  =  1.58  and  p  =  0.211.  The  precision  and  accuracy  of  the  method were  assessed  for  both  within-day  (ﬁve  spiked  microsome  sam- ples  for  each  concentration  on  the  same  day)  and  between-day (ﬁve  spiked  microsome  samples  for  each  concentration  for  three consecutive  days)  determinations.  Table  1  shows  the  results  for within-day  and  between-day  precision.  The  obtained  values  are in  agreement  with  literature  recommendations  [20]. The  lowest concentration  quantiﬁed  by  the  validated  method  was  0.028  �M with  a  relative  standard  deviation  value  below  10%  and  relative error  of  −3.86%.  The  absolute  recovery  of  the  lignan  (−)-grandisin extracted  from  the  rat  microsome  samples  spiked  with  the  con- centrations  of  0.057,  2.89  and  17.3  �M  was  77.7%,  88.3%  and  88.1%, respectively,  with  RSD  below  15%.  The  selectivity  test  showed  no interferences  from  the  biological  matrix  in  the  retention  time  of  the substrate  or  the  produced  metabolite  (Fig.  2C).  The  short-term  sta- bility  test  at  37 ◦C  and  at  room  temperature  showed  no  degradation of  the  substrate  in  the  evaluated  conditions  with  p  value  ≥0.1429 (Table  2). 3.2.  In  vitro  metabolism  study The  studied  substrate  (−)-grandisin  has  shown  several  phar- macological  effects,  such  as  cytotoxicity  and  antiangiogenic  effects [8],  antinocicoptive  and  anti-inﬂammatory  activities  [7],  protective effect  against  cyclophosphamide-induced  mutagenicity  in  mice [9]  and  trypanocidal  activities  [5,6].  Due  to  these  several  activ- ities  and  no  report  regarding  the  metabolism  of  this  lignan  by mammalian,  it  was  proposed  to  evaluate  the  behavior  of  this substrate  towards  the  cytochrome  rat  hepatic  enzymes,  since  mam- malian  metabolism  studies  should  be  established  in  the  early  drug development.  The  metabolism  rate  should  be  performed  in  linear conditions  in  relation  to  incubation  time  and  microsomal  protein concentration  to  determine  the  Michaelis–Menten  parameters.  Ini- tially,  the  microsomal  protein  concentration  was  varied  from  0.0 to  5.0  mg  protein  (0.0,  0.5,  1.0,  1.5,  2.0,  2.5,  3.0,  3.5,  4.0,  4.5  and G.B.

Thus,  2.0  mg  mL−1 was  chosen as  the  microsomal  protein  concentration  to  be  further  applied  in the  biotransformation  study.  Once  known  the  protein  concentra- tion,  the  next  step  was  the  optimization  of  the  incubation  time. The  incubation  time  was  varied  from  0  to  320  min  (0,  30,  60,  90, 120,  150,  180,  240,  280  and  320  min).  The  linearity  was  achieved in  the  range  of  90–180  min  (r  =  0.978)  and  180  min  was  chosen  as the  incubation  time  to  be  further  applied  in  the  determination of  the  kinetic  parameters.  After  the  optimization  of  the  micro- somal  protein  content  and  incubation  time,  the  Michaelis–Menten kinetic  parameters  were  determinated  by  varying  the  substrate concentration.  The  substrate  concentration  was  varied  in  the  range of  0.028–28.93  �M.  Fig.  3  shows  the  Michaelis–Menten  plot  for lignan  (−)-grandisin  after  metabolism  by  rat  liver  microsomes. The  initial  velocity  of  (−)-grandisin  disappearance  was  dependent upon  substrate  concentration  of  11.57  �M,  approaching  substrate saturation  at  23.14  �M.  The  Michaelis–Menten  rate  parame- ters  for  the  microsomal  CYP450  metabolism  of  (−)-grandisin were  calculated  using  nonlinear  regression.

Fig.  2A  shows  the  chro- matogram  of  the  (−)-grandisin  metabolism  after  100  min.  The major  CYP450  isoforms  present  in  rats  are  CYP3A2,  CYP2C11, CYP1A1/1A2,  CYP2E1,  CYP2D1  and  CYP2B1/2.  Between  them, CYP3A2  (corresponding  to  human  CYP3A4),  CYP2C11  (correspond- ing  to  human  CYP2C9)  and  CYP1A1/1A2  (corresponding  to  human CYP1A2)  represent  more  than  60%  of  the  total  rat  CYP  amount [21,22].  Therefore,  these  isoforms  might  be  involved  in  the  lig- nan  biotransformation.  However,  a  more  detailed  study  should be  conducted  employing  isolated  CYP  isoforms  (cDNA-expresses system-supersomes®) or  speciﬁc  anti-CYP  antibodies  to  ﬁnd  out, exactly,  which  isoform(s)  is(are)  involved  in  the  (−)-grandisin metabolism. The  metabolism  study  showed  the  formation  of  a  dihydro derivative  metabolite.  There  are  studies  reporting  the  metabolism of  the  (−)-grandisin  employing  species  of  fungi  [23]  and  Coleoptera and  Lepidoptera  species  [24]. These  studies  show  mainly  the  pro- duction  of  demethylated  phenolic  derivatives  or  the  cleavage  of the  molecule  losing  an  aromatic  ring.  At  the  present  paper,  it  was observed  the  formation  of  a  dihydro  metabolite  probably  by  an initial  oxidation  on  the  furan  ring  followed  by  a  water  molecule elimination.  The  proposal  was  based  in  the  major  fragment  ions. The  molecular  ion  was  observed  at  m/z  430  showing  less  than  two mass  units  in  comparison  with  grandisin.  For  grandisin,  an  impor- tant  pathway  starts  with  the  loss  of  half  compound  by  the  opening of  tetrahydrofuran  ring.  These  fragments  occur  at  m/z 208  and  224, while  for  the  metabolite,  these  fragments  were  missed  and  no  other correlated  mass  were  observed,  showing  an  alteration  in  the  central ring.  A  recent  study  applying  bioorganic  catalysis  led  the  isola- tion  of  dehydro-grandisin.  Its  structure  and  the  physic-chemical constants  were  determined  by  EI  MS,  ESI  MS, 1H  NMR,  speciﬁc  rota- tion,  and  circular  dichroism  [25].  Both  substances  have  the  identical EI  MS  spectrum  and  retention  time  during  the  analysis  by  GC–MS which  conﬁrm  the  structure  of  the  metabolite  produced  by  hepatic microsome  assay. As  the  chemical  model  induces  oxidation,  reason  that  this  reac- tion  is  considered  a  biomimetic  model  of  CYP,  this  result  indicated Fig.  3.  Michaelis–Menten  kinetics  plot.

Messiano  et  al.  / Journal  of  Pharmaceutical  and  Biomedical  Analysis  72 (2013) 240–  244 an  oxidation  following  by  a  dehydration,  despite  some  reduction reactions  have  been  related  to  some  compounds  in  metabolism reactions  [26,27]. However,  for  the  precise  pathway  for  the  pro- duction  of  this  metabolite,  some  experiments  using  speciﬁcs  CYP and  labeled  hydrogen  atoms  in  tetrahydrofuran  ring  should  be  per- formed.  Otherwise,  considering  that  grandisin  is  a  molecule  with few  positions  for  oxidation  or  reduction,  these  studies  could  sup- port  and  provide  important  information  about  the  grandisin  in  vivo metabolism. 4.  Conclusion This  paper  describes,  for  the  ﬁrst  time,  the  CYP450-mediated biotransformation  of  a  promising  natural  product  hit,  the  lig- nan  (−)-grandisin,  using  rat  microsomal  preparation.  The  kinetic parameters  indicated  that  the  biotransformation  of  this  natural product  obeys  the  Michaelis–Menten  kinetics  and  the  metabolism indicated  the  formation  of  2,5-dihydro-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-bis(3,4,5- trimethoxyphenyl)-furan  as  metabolite.  It  is  the  ﬁrst  report  about the  metabolism  of  this  lignan  using  mammalian  models.
