The structures of 1 and 2 were established on the basis of their spectroscopic data. Iridoid 1 and saponin 2 exhibited moderate inhibitory activities against Candida albicans and C. krusei in a dilution assay. Introduction. – Alibertia edulis (Rich.) A. Rich. ex DC, commonly known as �marmelada-bola�, is widely spread in the Brazilian �Cerrado�. The Alibertia genus is known for the occurrence of iridoids, triterpenoids and phenolic derivatives [2 – 6]. Recent phytochemical investigations of stems of A. macrophylla led to the isolation of a diterpene, 2b,3a,16a-trihydroxy ent-kaurane [5]. Previous studies of the leaves of A. edulis resulted in the isolation of ten triterpenes [7]. In our continuing chemical and biological investigations of the Brazilian Rubiaceae plant species, we report the isolation and structure elucidation of a new iridoid, 6b-hydroxy-7-epigardoside methyl ester (1), and a new saponin 3b-O-[a-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 ! 2)-O-b-d-glucopyrano- syl-(1 ! 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl]-28-O-b-d-glucopyranoside pomolate (2), from A. edulis stems together with known iridoids: shanzhiside methyl ester (3) and ixoside (4), and phenolic derivative 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl 1-O-b-d-apiofuranosyl-(1 ! 6)-O-b-d- glucopyranoside (5). We also report strong antifungal activity against pathogenic Candida-species yeast and Cryptococcus neoformans of the AcOEt extract of this species and, the moderate antifungal activity of compounds 1 and 2. Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 91 (2008) 1355 � 2008 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Z�rich 1) Part of the results have been presented with a poster at the 1st Brazilian Conference of Natural Products on November 4th – 7th, 2007 [1]. Results and Discussion. – The EtOH extract prepared from dried and powdered stems of A. edulis was submitted to partition in hexane, AcOEt, and BuOH. The preliminary biological screening indicated that the AcOEt extract showed antifungal activity (cf. Table 4). Fractionation and purification over silica RP-18 led to the isolation of compounds 1 – 5. The known compounds 3 – 5 were identified by comparing their spectroscopic data to those reported in literature [8 – 10]. Compound 1 was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The HR-ESI-MS of 1 showed a peak at m/z 403.1289 ([M � H]�), determining the molecular formula as being C17H24O11, and a peak at m/z 241.0738 ([M � H � 162]�), corresponding to the loss of a hexose moiety. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopic data were consistent with a b-glucopyranosyl unit and an iridoid aglycone. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed signals at d(H) 7.34 (d, J ¼ 1.0, H�C(3)) and 5.61 (d, J ¼ 2.0, H�C(1)) corresponding to an iridoid dihydropyran ring. The signal at d(H) 3.64 (s, 3 H) corresponded to a MeO group, and the signal at d(H) 5.21 (d, J ¼ 2.5, 2 H) corresponded to an exocyclic ¼CH2 group. An anomeric H-atom signal at d(H) 4.41 (d, J ¼ 8.5) confirmed the presence of a sugar residue with b-configuration. The 13C-NMR spectrum of 1 showed 17 signals. The C-atom signals at d(C) 35.5 (C), 41.8 (C), 95.0 (CH), 107.9 (C) and 152.2 (CH) were attributed to C-atoms C(5), C(9), C(1), C(4), and C(3), respectively of the dihydropyran ring of the iridoid aglycone. The remaining C-atoms signals, d(C) 73.7 (CH) and 73.5 (CH) were assigned to C(6) and C(7), respectively, and the signals at d(C) 110.0 (CH2(10)) and 150.4 (C(8)) were attributed to an exo-methylene function present in the structure. The gHMBC spectrum confirmed the assignment of C(6) and Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 91 (2008) 1356 C(7) due to the 3J-correlation observed between H�C(10) (d(H) 5.21) and C(7) (d(C) 73.5). The attachment of the b-d-glucopyranosyl moiety in 1 was established as in C(1) position in the aglycone, on the basis of the cross-peak correlations, in gHMBC, between H�C(1’) (d(H) 4.41) and C(1) (d(C) 95.0) (Table 1). The a-orientation of H�C(1) and b-orientation of H�C(5) and H�C(9) is in accordance with the biosynthetic origin of the iridoids [11]. The coupling constant between H�C(5) and H�C(6) (J < 1.0 Hz), together with the upfield shift of C(1) (d(C) 95.0), and the calculation of the shift difference between C(3) and C(4) (Dd ¼ 44.3) indicated that the orientation of the OH group at C(6) was b [12]. The appearance of H�C(6) as a broad singlet (d(H) 4.08) provided a small coupling constant between H�C(6) and H�C(7) (J < 1.0 Hz), corresponding to a dihedral angle close to 908, necessitating a trans-relationship between these H-atoms, which suggested the a- orientation of the OH group at C(7) [13]. This configuration was confirmed on basis of NOESY interactions between H�C(5) (d(H) 2.81) and H�C(9) (d(H) 3.12 – 3.15, b- oriented), and no interactions between H�C(6) or H�C(7). Thus, the structure of compound 1 was elucidated as 6b-hydroxy-7-epigardoside methyl ester. Compound 2 was obtained as a brown amorphous powder. The HR-ESI-MS of 2 showed a peak at m/z 1127.5641 ([M þ Na]þ), corresponding to the molecular formula C54H88O23. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed signals of seven Me groups at d(H) 0.81, 0.90, 0.99, 1.14, 1.23, 1.36 (s, each 3 H), and 0.96 (d, J ¼ 6.7, 3 H), and an olefinic H-atom at d(H) 5.33 (br. s). The 13C-NMR data confirmed the presence of seven Me C-atom signals at d(C) 15.8, 16.4, 16.7, 17.5, 24.6, 27.0, and 28.6, and a pair of olefinic C-atoms at d(C) 129.6 and 139.5, suggesting that the aglycone possesses an urs-12-ene skeleton. In the gHSQC spectrum, the long-range correlations observed for Me groups at d(H) 1.23 Table 1. 1H- and 13C-NMR Data of 1, together with gHMBC (H ! C) Correlations.

The presence of four sugar moieties was established from the signals of four anomeric H-atoms at d(H) 4.44 (d, J ¼ 7.7), 4.91 (d, J ¼ 7.6), 5.22 (br. s), and 5.36 (d, J ¼ 8.1), attached to the C-atoms at d(C) 105.5, 101.8, 101.9, and 95.6, respectively, in the gHSQC spectrum. The C-atom signals observed at d(C) 92.1 (C(3)) and 178.5 (C(28)) in the aglycone are consistent with a bidesmoside saponin moiety. Glyco- sylation of the alcoholic function at C(3) and esterification of the C(28)OOH group were indicated by the downfield shift (þ13.9 ppm) and upfield shift (�2.1 ppm) observed, respectively, for the resonance of these C-atoms in 2, relative to the corresponding signals in pomolic acid [14]. To confirm our assumption regarding the glycosidic composition of this compound, an ESI-IT-MSn experiment was performed.

An adduct at m/z 1139 was observed, and it was tentatively assigned to [M � H þ 2 H2O]�, which could result from the use of H2O to dissolve the sample [15]. The second order fragmentation of the adduct m/z 1139 led to a base peak at m/z 941 ([M � 162 � H]�), indicating the loss of a hexose moiety. The MS3 fragmentation from this ion (m/z 941) gave a product ion at m/z 795 ([M � 162 � 146 � H]�), corresponding to the loss of a deoxyhexose moiety. MS4 fragmentation from the ion m/z 795 yielded a peak at m/z 633 ([M � (2 � 162) � 146 � H]�), due to the loss of a second hexose moiety, and the MS5 fragmentation of this precursor ion produced a product ion at m/z 471 ([M � (3 � 162) � 146 � H]�), corresponding to the loss of a third hexose moiety and is in agreement with the molecular weight of the aglycone pomolic acid. The structures of the sugar moieties were deduced by 1D-TOCSY and 2D-NMR experiments (Table 3). The 1D-TOCSY method [16] allowed the subspectrum of a single monosaccharide unit to be extracted from the crowded overlapped region. Selected 1D-TOCSY data obtained by irradiation of each anomeric H-atom signal yielded the subspectrum of each sugar residue. Thus, the shifts of the sugar resonances were attributable to an a-l-rhamnopyranosyl (d(H) 5.22 (H�C(1Rha)) and three b-d- glucopyranosyl (d(H) 4.44 (H�C(1GlcI)), d(H) 4.91 (H�C(1GlcII)), and d(H) 5.36 (H�C(1GlcIII))) units. The b-orientation of all three anomeric centers of the glucopyranosyl moieties was supported by the relatively large coupling constant values observed for the H�C(1GlcI) (d, J ¼ 7.7), H�C(1GlcII) (d, J ¼ 7.6), and H�C(1GlcIII) (d, J ¼ 8.1). And the a-orientation of the anomeric H-atom of the rhamnopyranosyl moiety was based on the multiplicity of the H�C(1Rha) signal (br. s). The absolute configuration of the sugar residues has been tentatively determined by biogenetic considerations. The positions of the sugar moieties were unambiguously defined by the gHMBC experiment. A cross-peak due to long-range correlations between H�C(1GlcI) (d(H) 4.44) and C(3) (d(C) 92.1) of the aglycone indicated that this sugar unit was linked at C(3) of the aglycone. Yet, a long-range connectivity between H�C(1GlcIII) (d(H) 5.36) and C(28) (d(C) 178.5) indicated this sugar to be involved in an ester linkage with the C(28)OOH group. Similarly, cross-peaks were observed between H�C(1GlcII) (d(H) 4.91) and C(2GlcI) (d(C) 78.1), and between H�C(1Rha) (d(H) 5.22) and C(2GlcII) (d(C) 79.4). On the basis of these findings, compound 2 was established to be 3b-O-[a-l- rhamnopyranosyl-(1 ! 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 ! 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl]-28-O- b-d-glucopyranoside pomolate. All isolated compounds were evaluated with respect to antifungal activity (Table 4), and all showed moderate antifungal activity against Candida albicans and C. krusei in a dilution assay [17]. On the other hand, none of the compounds showed inhibitory effects against Candida parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans within the concentration range tested (250.0 – 0.4 mg/ml). The stronger activity of the AcOEt extract compared to the isolated compounds may be due to the occurrence of tannins that were detected by FeCl3 and gelatin/NaCl tests [18]. Toxicity of tannins towards microorganisms is well documented [19]. This is the first report of the isolation of a saponin from the Alibertia genus. Among the isolated compounds, only 3 had already been reported in this genus [5]. Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 91 (2008) 1359 The species of the Rubiaceae family contains a great diversity of secondary metabolites: iridoids, indole alkaloids, anthraquinones, flavonoids, phenolic derivatives, diterpenes, triterpenes, and other types of alkaloids. The Alibertia genus is known for the occurrence of iridoids, triterpenoids and phenolic derivatives [2 – 6].

Rich. ex DC was collected in the surrounding of Apore´ – GO, Brazil, in July 2004 by Dr. C. C. da Silva and identified by Dr. I. Cordeiro. A voucher specimen (SP 370.913) was deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Botaˆnica, Sa˜o Paulo – SP, Brazil. Extraction and Isolation. The dried and powdered stems (600.0 g) of A. edulis were extracted with EtOH (2 l, r.t., 3 d each time) to give a crude material (43.2 g), which was solubilized with MeOH/H2O (80 :20, v/v) and partitioned between hexane, AcOEt, and BuOH (3 � 800 ml each one). These extracts were examined for the occurrence of tannins using FeCl3 and gelatin/NaCl tests, and evaluated for their antifungal activity. After evaporation, a part of the active AcOEt extract (0.50 g) was subjected to CC (RP18; gradient of MeOH/H2O 05 :95 to 100 :0, v/v). A total of nine fractions were collected and combined into seven pools (1 – 7) on the basis of similar TLC profiles. Fr. 3 (MeOH/H2O 20 :80, v/v; 84.4 mg) was submitted to a prep.

Antifungal Assay. Microorganisms Used, and Growth Conditions. The test organisms included Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), and Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012). The microorganisms were originally obtained from the Helvetica Chimica Acta – Vol. 91 (2008) 1361 Mycology Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Analysis at Sa˜o Paulo State University (UNESP). The yeasts were grown and maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 h at r.t. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. The antifungal activity tests were performed using the broth microdilution method as described in the M27-A2 document of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) with modifications. The medium used was RPMI 1640, with l-glutamine buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165m morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), supplemented with 2% glucose. The test samples were dissolved in DMSO. The cell suspension was prepared in 0.85% saline soln. with an optical density equivalent to McFarland 0.5 and diluted to 1:100 in RPMI for the final concentration to be 1 · 105 to 5 · 105 CFU/ml. This suspension was inoculated onto a microdilution plate previously prepared with the test samples diluted to concentrations from 250 mg/ml to 0.4 mg/ml. The plates were incubated under agitation at 378 for 24 h for the Candida species, and 48 h for Cryptococcus neoformans. Fungal growth was evaluated visually and spectrophotometrically. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which the optical density (OD) was reduced to 90% of the OD of the growth control well. Amphotericin B (3 mg/ml) was used as positive control and DMSO as a negative control. MIC values were determined from three independent experiments. REFERENCES [1] V. C. da Silva, V. Carbone, S.
