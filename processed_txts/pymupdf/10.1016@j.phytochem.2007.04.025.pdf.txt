The labelling pattern in the isolated gaudichaudianic acid was determined by quantitative 13C NMR spec- troscopy analysis and was consistent with involvement of both mevalonic acid and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathways in the formation of the dimethylallyl- and geranyl-derived moieties. The results conﬁrmed that both plastidic and cytoplasmic pathways are able to provide isopentenyl diphosphate units for prenylation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. � 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction The isoprenoids, when considered together with the ste- roids, constitute the largest class of secondary metabolites comprising more than 30,000 known compounds (Dictio- nary of Natural Products, 2000). The common biosynthetic building block of this group, the so-called isoprene unit, is derived from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethyl- allyl diphosphate (DMAPP). The biosynthesis of IPP can proceed via two diﬀerent pathways, namely the long- established mevalonic acid (MVA) and the 2-C-methyl-D- erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathways, the reaction sequence of which has been characterized (Adam et al., 1999). In plants, the MEP pathway appears generally oper- ative for formation of monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, phy- tols and carotenoids (Hirai et al., 2000; Umlauf et al., 2004; Bouvier et al., 2005). The key regulatory step of the MVA pathway involves reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG- CoA) to mevalonate, with this being catalysed by the cyto- solic enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR; Fig. 1). Plastidic IPP is derived, however, from MEP formed via the condensation of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phos- phate (G3P) catalysed by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS; Fig. 1) (Bouvier et al., 2005; Enﬁssi et al., 2005). The two pathways to IPP are thus compart- mentalized in the cytosol and the plastid, respectively; how- ever, they may function in the formation of certain isoprenoids, in a cooperative process that results from met- abolic cross-talk within the plastidic envelope membrane (Enﬁssi et al., 2005). A quantitative assessment of the diﬀerential contribu- tion of the two IPP pathways in the biosynthesis of an individual isoprenoid may be deduced from the 13C-label- ling pattern, as determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy, fol- lowing incorporation of [1-13C]-D-glucose into product (Rohmer et al., 1993; Umlauf et al., 2004).

Thus, DMAPP arising from the MVA pathway, involving three C-2 labelled acetyl CoA molecules, should be labelled at C-2, C-4 and C-5. In the MEP pathway, label from the C-3 positions of G3P and pyruvate would give rise to DMAPP labelled at C-1 and C-5. Involvement of C-2 labelled acetyl CoA in the tricar- boxylic acid cycle (TCA) could, however, lead to the pres- ence of an additional label at C-2 of pyruvate and, subsequently, at C-3 of DMAPP. An understanding of the correlations between isotopic fractionations and bio- chemical processes is, therefore, essential in the elucidation of biosynthetic pathways and for the discrimination among alternative pathways (Chikaraishi et al., 2004). Moreover, mixed biosynthesis with contributions from both pathways may be determined from such studies (Adam et al., 1998; Bergamo et al., 2005). In continuation of previous studies concerning IPP bio- synthesis in plant isoprenoids (Schwender et al., 1996; Knoss et al., 1997; Thiel et al., 1997; Adam and Zapp, 1998; Adam et al., 1998, 1999; Hirai et al., 2000; Barlow et al., 2001; Hertewich et al., 2001; Thiel and Adam, 2002; Umlauf et al., 2004; Masse´ et al., 2004; Wungsinta- weekul and De-Eknamkul, 2005; Bergamo et al., 2005), the metabolism of the powerful antifungal compound (2S)-2-methyl-2-(40-methyl-30-pentenyl)-8-(300-methyl-2- butenyl)- 2H-1-benzopyran-6-carboxylic acid (1; gaudich- audianic acid), the major constituent of leaves and roots of Piper gaudichaudianum Kunth (Piperaceae) (Lago et al., 2004), was investigated.

With the aim of deter- mining the biosynthetic origin of the isoprene moieties of gaudichaudianic acid, precursor administration experi- ments with leaves of P. gaudichaudianum using [1-13C]-D- glucose as precursor were carried out. 2. Results and discussion A sample of 13C-enriched gaudichaudianic acid (1) was isolated by CC fractionation of a CHCl3–MeOH extract derived from young leaves of P. gaudichaudianum that had been administrated with an [1-13C]-D-glucose solution for 72 h. The 13C NMR spectra of 1 enriched with 13C and that of a reference sample of the chromene (13C natural abundance) were measured in CDCl3 under identical con- ditions, and the relative enrichment at each position was calculated by assuming an abundance of 1.1% for the car- bon with the lowest 13C-enrichment. The results presented in Table 1 demonstrated that increases in the signals of the prenyl moieties occurred at all positions except C-40 and C-300. As shown in Fig. 2, incor- poration of label into 1 at C-30, C-50, C-60, C-200, C-400 and C-500 is consistent with the operation of the MVA pathway, whilst enhancement of signals at C-20, C-50, C-100 and C-500 would be as expected from the MEP pathway. Administer- ing [1-13C]-D-glucose thus resulted in increases in isotopic labeling, at positions 2, 4 and 5, as well as at 1 and 5, of IPP indicating simultaneous operation of the MVA and MEP pathways, respectively (Kuzuyama and Seto, 2003). Additionally, signiﬁcant 13C-enrichment was observed in the pyran ring of 1 at position C-2, corresponding to position 3 of IPP. Such enrichment could derive from [2-13C]-pyruvate formed from [2-13C]-acetyl CoA returning through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) (Fig. 1). If both [2-13C]- and [3-13C]-pyruvate enter the MEP pathway, IPP units labelled at C-1, C-3 and C-5 would be formed. More- over, since C-4 and C-5 of DMAPP are chemically equiva- lent, if the stereo-control of the IPP/DMAPP isomerase is imperfect, labelling of this isoprene unit at C-4 could also be observed as shown previously for abscisic acid (Hirai et al., 2000). The increases in signal intensities at positions C-4a, C-5 and C-8 of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid moiety presumably result from scrambling of label from [1-13C]- D-glucose after glycolysis. 3. Conclusion The observation of mixed biosynthesis, with contribu- tions from both the MVA and the MEP pathways, implies that certain biosynthetic steps proceed in diﬀerent compart- ments, and that speciﬁc intermediates traverse the chloro- plast boundary. In the case of the formation of 1, it would appear that prenylation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid by GPP occurs in the plastid with the prenyl moiety having been syn- thesised from IPP units derived from each pathway. Two alternatives routes to 1 should be considered. In the ﬁrst, ini- tial C-prenylation with DMAPP derived from either the MVA or MEP pathways would be followed by a second C-prenylation of the aromatic nucleus with a GPP unit thus forming the benzopyran ring. The alternative pathway would involve initial prenylation with GPP followed by a second prenylation with DMAPP. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of the isoprene units in P. gaudichaudianum described herein is shown in Fig. 3. This report thus consti- tutes the second example of the participation of DMAPP/ IPP moieties derived from both MVA and MEP in the pre- nylation of benzoic acid derivatives (Bergamo et al., 2005). 4.

Administration of [1-13C]-D-glucose into young leaves from P. gaudichaudianum Eleven leaves, freshly excised from 4 to 5-month-old plants, were placed separately in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and each administrated 100 lL of a 10% solution of [1-13C]-D-glucose in water at 25 �C for 72 h (Bergamo et al., 2005). 4.4. Extraction and isolation of 1 After incubation, the leaves were frozen in liquid N2 and subsequently extracted with 2 · 25 mL CHCl3–MeOH (2:1). The organic extracts were combined, evaporated to dryness in vacuum, with the resulting extract (0.250 g) frac- tionated by CC over silica gel (Merck; 70–230 mesh; 20 · 1.4 cm column) using hexane as eluent, containing increasing amounts of EtOAc (up to 50%) to yield 10 frac- tions. Fraction 7 (0.080 g) was further separated by CC over reversed phase ODS (Merck; C-18; 2.0 · 1.0 cm col- umn) with MeOH–H2O (4:1) to yield 6 fractions, the third of which (0.043 g) was submitted to CC over silica gel (Merck; 230–400 mesh; 5 · 1.0 cm column) eluted with hex- ane–EtOAc (4:1) to yield 1 (0.011 g) as an amorphous col- ourless solid.
