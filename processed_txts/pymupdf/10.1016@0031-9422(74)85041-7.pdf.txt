INTRODUCTION  Licariu canella (Meissn.) Kosterm. is a tree which grows in the Amazon region. The trunk  wood yielded sitosterol, dillapiol (l-allyl-2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene),  ele-  micin (5-allyl-1,2,3_trimethoxybenzene)  and three new compounds  for which the names  canellin-A, -B and -C are proposed.  The oxygen functions of canellin-A, C1 ,H180h, were easily assigned by PMR spectro-  metry, warranting expansion of the formula to C1 sH1 8. 20H. 20Me. 02CHz. The C, ,-ske-  leton is of the guianin (1) type;2 thus, the MS contains a prominent m/e 162 peak attribu-  table to 2 (Scheme), since PMR evidence accounts for all protons in the C,2H,,,02  unit  of the partial structure 3. In contrast to guianin, however, here both undefined centres are  fully substituted. The cc-proton (T 6.75, d, J 9.0 Hz) is coupled to one vicinal hydrogen, and  the /?-proton (signal analyzable in the NMR of dihydrocanellin-A:  T 7.63, apparent quin-  tuplet, J apparently  2: 8 Hz, in reality J 7.0 and 9.0 Hz) is coupled to four hydrogens.  Both hydroxyls have secondary alcohol functions, since two of the oxymethine proton  signals suffer 1 ppm paramagnetic  shifts on acetylation.  One of these protons is repre-  sented by a singlet (z 6.49) and the respective CHOH group must, consequently, be located  * Part 26 in the series “The Chemistry  of Brazilian  Lauraceae”.

The other proton  is represented  by a doublet  (z 5.97)  whose coupling  constant  (J 6.5 Hz) reveals its axialkxial  interaction  H ith a neighbouring  proton.  This could. u pr.io~i, belong  tither  to the CHOMe  or to the CH2 units. The oxy-  methine  hydrogen,  however. is represented  by a triplet (r 6.38, .I 6-5 Hz) and is thus subject  to two axial interactions,  while the axial methylene  hydrogen  is represented  by a doublet  (T 8.46, J 15.8 and 6.5 Hz) and thus vicinal to only one axial proton.  This karbon  system  must, consequently,  be formulated  as shown in 3, a sequence  which agrees with the obscr-  vation  that only the CHOMe  signal (A -0.3  ppm). but not the CH,  signals.  is shifted on  acetylation.

The PMR spectrum  contains  only the ether methine  proton  signal assigned  above.  and the allylic methylcnc  protons  (r 7.50 7.62. m: 1; 7.95. c/r/. .I 9.2 and  13.5 Hz) are non-  equivalent  and coupled  only to each other and the adjacent  olcfinic  hydrogen.  The units of partial  structure  3 can be assembled  in four ways (4a. b: 5a. b). The nllylben-  zenes, which arc presumed  biogenetic  precursors  of canellin-A.  arc uniformly  oxygenated  at the ptrrw-position  so that the pair of alternatives  4b and 51 are hiphly improbable.  By  contrast.  the biosyntheses  of 4a and Sb involve  reasonable  metabolitrs.  such as 6a or 7a.  derived by oxidation  of an clemicin  precursor,  or 6b or 7b. derived  by oxidation  of a dilla-  piol precursor.  Radicals  of type 6 are certainly  formed  in Lauraceae.  as documented  in  the structures  ofguinnan  (1 ).’ porosin  (8)” and burchellin  (9).5 In addition.  since I7lrr.a~sub-  The neolignans of Licarcia cundlrr  2287  stitution is favoured over ortho-substitution,5  canellin-A is probably formed by coupling  of 6a or b with a radical derived from isoeugenol’j leading to 10 or 11, both of which would  yield 4a, rather than 5b.  The MS fragmentation (Scheme), is, of course, consistent with either alternative. A tenta-  tive decision in favour of 4a, with the relative stereochemistry  13a, was reached by the  following set of experiments. Treatment of canellin-A with the Jones reagent led to a mix-  ture of ketones with carbonyls  in 5-(v,,, 1745 cm- ‘) and 6-(v,,, 1720 cm- ‘) membered  cycles. Since oxidation of dihydrocanellin-A  failed to give a pure product, a partially pro-  tected substrate was prepared. Selective acetylation of canellin-A at the C-4 hydroxyl, diag-  nosed by the shift of the carbinolic proton doublet (A - 1.04 ppm), led to a monoacetate.  This was oxidized to give a pure ketone (12) which, as well as its hydrolysis product, has  the carbonyl in a five-membered  ring (v,,,1760cm-  ‘). Oxidation  of dihydrocanellin-A  monoacetate  also afforded a pure ketone (dihydro-12, v,,,,,1750 cm- ‘). The acetate car-  bonyls of the mono- and di-acetates show bands at lower frequency (1735 cm- ‘).

Me0  0  (7)  Transformation  of the secondary alcohol at C-8 into a carbonyl (dihydro-13b-+  di-  hydro-12) was accompanied by two PMR phenomena. Thus, there are diamagnetic shifts  of the ArH (A H-2’ 0.54, H-5’ 0.25, H-6’ 0.23 ppm) and the H-7 (A 0.50 ppm) signals, which  contrasts with the virtual constancy of the H-6 (A - 0.05 ppm) and Me-7 (A - 0.04 ppm)  signals. The exo-endo arrangement, which thus becomes obvious for the aryl-methyl sub-  stituents, imposes the tram configuration  on the 6,7-bond, a fact which is consistent with  the relatively large coupling J6,7 9.0 Hz [porosin (8) burchellin (9) and guianin (l), admit-  tedly imperfect analogies, J resp. 5.4, 9.5 and 7.0 Hz] and the normal chemical shift of the  Me-7 protons (r 9.13). The cis configuration would place these protons into the positively  shielded region above the aromatic plane [see porosin (8) T 9.483. The second PMR feature  is the large paramagnetic  shift of the high field (A 0.10 ppm). which contrasts  with the low  field (A 0.02 ppm) methoxy  signal.  The former  signal  must  thus be correlated  with the  bridgehead  methoxyl  situated  in the plane of the introduced  carbonyl.  The high field but  not the low field signal is sensitive  to change  of solvent.  Thus, on changing  from CDCl,  to Ccl,  solutions  of canellin-A  and its derivatives  this signal is shifted to even higher field  (4a: A 0.14 ppm, dihydro-13b:  A 0.06 ppm). Formation  of a D-bridge  between  the basic  aryl group and the solvent  molecule  is possible,  evidently.  only in CDC‘l,.-  The fact that  the heightened  magnetic  anisotropy  of the aryl group in Ccl,  produces  additional  shield-  ing of methoxyl  is taken as an indication  that thcsc groups are vicinal and excludes  struc-  ture Sh as a vlablc alternative.  ,-,-I&Ye  Tn&Ye  Me0  ,  ,Y  0  I  Me0  ’  0  ’ l”’  O  (8)  (9)  (10)  (11)  Acetylation  of the hydroxyl  at C-4 leaves the ArH and H-7 signals unaffected.  but causes  significant  shifts of the H-6 (A - 0.40 ppm) and H-3 (A - 1.00 ppm) signals. The modified  group must thus  occupy  the ~~I&~ face of the molecule  and. since the proton  at C-4 is axial.  as shown by its axial  axial interaction  (.J 6.5 Hz) with the ncighbouring  H-3, the h-mem-  bercd  ring occurs  in the chair  conformation.  The equatorial  conformation  of the ace-  toxyl is consistent  ~+ith the relative  resistance  of 7 to hydrolysis  \vhich requires  hot _“‘~,)  aq. NaOH.  The PMR  spectrum  of the resulting  alcohol  showed,  besides  the expected  changes,  the carbinolic  proton  signal with an unexpectedly  small J (W 2 Hz) and the OMe-  5 signal at an unexpectedly  high field (~7.20). These facts probably  reflect a retroaldol-aldol  equilibrium.  The consequent  inversion  at C-4 pushes the H-4 into the equatorial  position  (hence diminishing  Jl,_ 3 f, s ) and the methoxyl  over the aryl group (hence increasing  ~~~~~~  Finally.  acet>lation  of t6c hydroxyl  at C-8 shifts the H-7 signal (A --0.X  ppm), but leaves  the signals due to the protons  of the e-membered  ring unaltered.  Its orientation  towards  the Smembered  ring is. consequently,  indicated.  Only  in this configuration  would  it bc  able to contribute  towards  the molecular  asymmetry  caused  1~1 the ar}I group  and por-  trayed by the slight non-equivalence  of the methylenedioxy  protons  (AB system. r 4.1 1 and  4.13). This non-equivalence  would be expcctcd  to be enhanced  through  xubstitution  of the  C-X carbinol  by a cnrbonyl  and this is indeed the case (AB s!‘stem. 7 4.19 and 3.11).

O,CH,  .20Me  after in-  spection of the PMR spectrum. This showed additionally  that canellin-B (~,,,I660 cm- ‘)  is of the porosin (v,,,1667 cm-‘, 8)3 type (Table 1). With the exception that the two aro-  matic methoxy signal in porosin are replaced by a 02CH,  signal, and that its H-4 singlet  is replaced by a signal due to an enolic methoxyl, all spectral features are duplicated, and  must, consequently  be interpreted  in an analogous manner, leading to structure  14 for  canellin-B. In contrast to the situation in porosin where the multiplicity of the pertinent  PMR signals indicate the relative locations of the functions on the aliphatic 6-membered  ring, in the case of canellin-B structure 15 has to be considered as a valid, albeit less prob-  able, alternative. The stereochemistry  of the 2,3-bond constitutes an additional difference  between the two neolignans. Clearly cis in porosin (JH_-2,H_3 5.4 Hz), where the Me group  (z 9.48) falls into the shielded region above the aryl group, it is truns in canellin-B (JiI_-2,H_-3  10.0 Hz, tMe 8.96). The MS is compatible  with the proposed  structures, revealing the  expected facile loss of an ally1 radical ([M-C,H,]+  lOOoi,, [M-C,H,-CO]+  847;) and  cleavage of the heterocycle ([CH202C,H3CH=CHMe]+  90%).  Canellin-C, C20H240h, is also a bisarylpropanoid,  since functional analysis establishes  the partial structure C1 (lH 1 70. 20H. OMe. O,CH,.  The undefined oxygen in this for-  mula, however, is not part of an ether, but of a carbonyl function in saturated environment  (v,,,,,1720cm-‘),  and thus the compound could be a structural analogue of canellin-A (4a),  rather than of canellin-B (14 or 15). Indeed, comparison  of the PMR spectra (Table 2)  clearly favours this. The significant difference reveals replacement of the methoxymethine  at position 4 in canellin-A (4a) by the carbonyl in canellin-C. This fact rationalizes  the  appearance of the C-4 oxymethine signal as a singlet and of the C-2 methylene signals at  lower field. Alternatives to structure 16a, which thus is tentatively proposed for canellin-C,  could not be disproved, due to lack of material.  The relationship between canellins A and C extends to their stereochemistry.  While the  hydroxyl at C-8 of guianin (1)2 is acetylated with ease, only the 4-0-acetyl derivatives (13b,  2290  A. M. GIESRKI CIIT.  N. C. FRAVA. 0. R GOUI.II H and A. 1. DA Rot-t1.4  16b) result upon treatment  of the two canellins  with AclO:C,,H,N  at room temp. Attack  of the hydroxyl  at C-S seems to be hindered  by the proximity  of the aryl group,  the  exe-attachment  of this group  being evident,  additionally,  by the non-equivalence  of the  methylenedioxy  protons.  The benzylic  hydrogens  at C-6 are thus in&  oriented  in the  canellins  A and C, the diamagnetic  shift of the respective  signal upon passing  from A to C  being due to shielding  by the carbonyl  of the latter cmpd.
