All  rights reserved  INTRODUCTION  The Meliaceae  is known to be a rich source of limon-  oids, which  possess  interesting  biological  activities  against  insects  such  as antifeeding,  deterrent  and  inhibitors  of ecdyasis [l]. As part of our interest in the  chemistry  of the family Meliaceae,  we have recently  reported  the isolation  of cycloartane  triterpenoids,  caryophyllene  epoxide and a mixture of w-phenyl  alk-  anoic and alkenoic  acids from the leaves of Trichilia  claussenii DC. collected  in Brazil [2]. In continuation  of the study of this species, we have investigated  the  stems extracts  of T. claussenii. We have not found  limonoids  in this plant,  but here we report  the iso-  lation and identification  of steroids  from stems of T.  claussenii.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The methanol  extract of the stems of Trichilia claus-  senii was submitted  to solvent partition  followed  by  several column chromatographies.  This procedure  led  to the isolation  of a series of steroids  which  were  identified  as following.  The DCIMS  of 1 showed the [M + H] peak m/z 321  and the “C NMR spectrum  showed 19 carbon signals.  The multiplicities  of the carbons determined  by DEPT  135 led to the attribution  of: 4 C, 5 CH, 9 CH, and 1  CH,, allowing  us to propose  the molecular  formula  *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.  C,,H,,O,  for compound  1, an androstane  steroid.  Among the quaternary  carbons  one was attributed  to  a hemiketal(6  107.8), one CH carbinolic  (6 73.2), one  CH2 carbinolic  (6 66.1), one carbonyl  (6 217.8) and  only one methyl carbon (6 17.8). The presence of only  one methyl group led us to propose  that the second  one  for  androstane  steroids  was  replaced  by  a  hydroxymethylene  group which is part of the cyclic  hemiketal  moiety  (6 4.10, 3.89, both d, J = 8.0 Hz).  The ‘H NMR spectrum  of 1 showed another AB coup-  ling system for 2H-1 (6 2.30, 2.40, both  d, J = 11.2  Hz), which led us to propose  the position  of the hemi-  ketal ring between  C-2 and C-19. Other possibilities  of ring closure of the hemiketal  were ruled out mainly  through  analysis  of the NMR  data.  Analysis  of  HMBC, HMQC and NOEDIF  of 1, together  with the  ‘H-‘H  COSY  of its acetate  la confirmed  the pos-  itioning  of the hemiketal  ring. In the ‘H-‘H COSY a  ‘w coupling  was observed  between  H-3 (6 5.41, ddd,  J=  1.7,2.7,3.3Hz)andH-18(62.50,dd,J=  1.7,11.5  Hz), indicating  an a-configuration  for the hydroxyl  at  C-3. In the HMBC experiment  the following  were the  most important  correlations  observed:  C-2/H-3,  C-  3/H-l/?, C-S/H-lb,  C-5/H-la  and C-3/H-5,  other cor-  relations  are described  in Table 3. NOEDIF  was also  used to confirm  the structure  for compound  1: when  H-19a was irradiated  an NOE was observed  with H-  18, H-lip  and H-8. Irradiation  of H-19b caused  a  NOE  for H-4/?, H-6/? and  H-8,  other  NOES  are  described  in Table 4.  All the information  above confirmed  the structure  of 1 with this new arrangement  containing  the hemi-  ketal between C-2 and C- 19.  1495  1496  M. T.

The  m/z 349 [M +H]+  peak  observed  for 2 in the DCIMS  requires two more car-  bon atoms in relation to 1, and this was confirmed  by  the 13C NMR spectrum  which showed 21 signals. The  combination  of the data above  with the ‘H NMR  spectrum  showing  a methyl signal (6 1.04, t, J = 7.2  Hz) led to the molecular  formula  C2,H,?0,  for this  pregnane  steroid. As observed  for compound  1, com-  pound  2 also displays  a hemiketal  ring between  C-2  and C-19. This observation  was deduced  on the basis  of spectral  analysis  ‘H NMR,  ‘% NMR,  HMBC,  5 R=H  5a R=Ac  HMQC and NOEDIF  (Tables 14). For compound  2  the coupling  constants  obtained  for H-3 (6 4.15, dd,  / = 6.0, 10.4) allowed us to propose  a /I-configuration  for the hydroxyl  group  at C-3. Other  differences  observed  in the ‘H NMR spectra of compounds  1 and  2 refer to the chemical shifts for H-l c( and H- lp which  are very close for compound  1 (A 6 0.10) and more  distinct  for 2 (A6 1.17), this difference  might be due  to the influence  of pyridine  and its different  associ-  ation to the hydroxyl  groups.  To check and confirm  this possibility  ‘H NMR spectra for both compounds  were run in methanol-d,,  and both H-lee and H-lfl  C  1  la  2  2a  2b  3  3a  4  4a  5  5a  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  IO  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  39.9  38.6  107.8  108.6  13.2  71.7  37.5  33.8  39.7  39.1  29.5  28.5  32.0  31.5  36.5  36.6  46.3  45.8  48.4  47.6  20.9  20.7  37.8  37.7  38.8  38.8  51.5  51.6  39.4  39.7  217.8  217.9  55.9  55.7  17.8  17.9  66.1  68.0  -  OCOME  -  OCOMe  -  O(=OMe  -  OCOMe  -  OCOE  -  OCO&  -  Androstane  and pregnane  steroids from Trichilia cluussenii  Table 1. ‘% NMR data for steroids  (pyridine-d5)  and acetates  (CDCl,)  (6, 100 MHz)  1497  169.9  169.0  21.3  22.1  43.8  105.8  74.2  38.4  42.9  29.4  31.8  36.0  46.1  47.6  20.8  37.7  41.7  50.2  38.5  218.2  65.0  13.1  67.1  17.9  13.6  42.4  48.3  108.5  202.5  72.3  75.1  38.3  35.3  42.3  43.8  28.9  27.2  31.5  31.8  36.3  34.0  45.8  53.2  48.1  43.4  20.9  21.1  34.1  37.9  41.8  41.9  50.4  50.8  31.7  38.3  218.7  218.6  65.2  65.1  13.4  13.4  67.7  63.1  17.6  17.6  13.3  13.5  170.3  170.6  170.3  170.2  21.6  20.6  21.0  20.8  44.5  72.7  72.8  77.2  50.2  26.5  32.7  34.0  56.7  35.6  20.4  38.1  42.1  50.5  38.5  218.4  65.1  13.5  17.4  18.0  13.6  40.7  70.5  68.9  71.9  47.6  24.1  31.9  33.8  55.7  35.4  20.2  37.9  42.1  50.3  38.4  219.3  65.2  13.4  15.3  17.6  13.4  170.6  170.3  170.1  21.2  20.9  20.7  41.8  66.4  74.9  77.3  44.0  25.5  32.9  34.1  55.6  31.6  20.2  38.0  42.1  50.5  38.5  218.5  65.0  13.4  16.1  18.0  13.6  37.3  67.6  68.7  74.0  43.6  23.1  31.9  33.7  54.9  37.2  20.0  37.9  42.1  50.4  38.4  219.3  65.2  13.5  14.8  17.6  13.5  170.3  169.7  169.5  21.1  21.0  20.9  43.7  70.0  72.6  33.6  45.9  28.1  32.5  34.0  55.4  36.0  21.1  38.3  42.2  50.4  38.5  218.5  65.2  13.5  14.9  18.1  13.7  -  -  41.1  69.9  72.4  29.4  45.4  27.9  32.0  34.0  55.1  35.7  20.8  38.2  42.2  50.4  38.4  219.3  65.4  13.4  14.4  17.6  13.5  170.3  170.3  21.3  21.1  were shown to be more shielded  in comparison  with  the chemical  shifts observed  in pyridine-d,.  When 2  was submitted  to acetylation  with acetic anhydride  in pyridine  and catalytic  amounts  of DMAP,  two  diacetates  were obtained.  One referring  to the acety-  lation of the alcohol and hemiketal2a,  and the second  2b corresponding  to the diacetate  which  originated  from the opening  of the hemiketal.  Compounds  3 and 4 were isolated  from  T. sch-  omburgkii  [3,4] for the first time. All 13C NMR spectra  obtained  for compounds  3 and 4 are in agreement  with  those reported  in the literature  (Table 1). However,  in  the ‘H NMR  spectra for compounds  3 and 4, it was  not possible  to observe  the multiplicities  for the car-  binolic  protons  (H-2, H-3 and H-4). in spite of the  fact that they displayed  the same chemical shifts, when  the spectra  were run in the same solvent.  However,  the compounds  were obtained  as triacetate  derivatives  3a and 4a,where the multiplicities  of H-2, H-3 and H-  4 were the same as observed  for the natural  products  described  in the literature.  Compound  3a showed  in  the ‘H NMR  spectrum  a W-coupling  between  H-2  and H-4, as described  for the natural  product  3 iso-  lated from T. schomburgkii  [3]. In the HMBC experi-  ments due to the very close chemical  shifts observed  for C-2 and C-3 it was not possible to assign unequivo-  cally each correlation.  The following  correlations  for  the carbinolic  protons  were observed  for 3: C-IO/H-2,  C-10/H-4,C-2  or C-3/H-2,  C-2 or C-3/H-4,  C-2 or C-  3/H-3 and C-4/H-4.  For compound  4 the correlations  observed  for the carbinolic  protons  were: C-I /H-3, C-  10/H-4, C-2/H-4,  C-3/H-2,  C-3/H-3  and C-4/H-4.  In  the literature  [3] the long-range  ‘H-13C correlations  observed  for a monoacetate  of 3 are limited to those  involving  methyl  hydrogens.  Compounds  3 and 4  showed  different  melting  points  and [cc], from those  described  in the literature.  However,  the duplication  of the Me-18 signals  observed  in the ‘H NMR  for  compounds  2 and 4 suggests the epimerization  of C-  17 when the NMR spectra were run in pyridine.  The ‘H NMR and 13C NMR spectra for compound  5 were very similar to those for 3 and 4. The only  difference  observed  was due to the presence  of only  two hydroxyl  groups attached  to the ring A. The pos-  itioning  of the hydroxyls  and their stereochemistry  were determined  through  analysis  of ‘H NMR  and  ‘%I NMR of 5 and its diacetate  5a. The signals (6 4.04,  m, and 6 3.65 ddd, J = 4.0, 4.8. 11.2 Hz) displayed  in  ‘H NMR  of 5 led us to propose  a cis-relationship  between H-2 and H-3, where H-2 is equatorial  and H-  3 is axial. This was confirmed  by the ‘HP’H COSY  spectrum  of 5a which showed that the acetylcarbonilic  protons  are coupling  to each other,  and with two  other different  protons.  Therefore,  the hydroxyls  are  vicinals and located at C-2 and C-3. The comparison  of the chemical  shifts and multiplicities  of H-2 in 5,  1498  M. T. PUPO et al.

Therefore,  both  hydroxyls  have the /I-con-  figuration.  The possibility  of different stereochemistry  for both hydroxyls  was ruled out through  comparison  of the ‘% NMR with models from the literature  [5].  The androstane  (1) and pregnane  (2) 2P,19-hemi-  ketal represent  a novel group of steroids  from plants  [6]. The closest analogues  of this nucleus would appear  to be the pregnane-  10,2-carbolactones  isolated  from  the sponge  species Strongylophora  sp. [7]. Pregnane  derivatives  have been isolated  from  the Meliaceae  (Melia azedarach var. japonica [LX], Melia toosendon [9,  lo], Turrea villosa [I l] and Trichilia schomburgkii [3,  4]), Simaroubaceae  (Ailanthus grandis [12]) and from  Burseraceae  (Commiphora mukul [ 131). Thus,  com-  pounds  1 and 2 show a significant  enlargement  of the  patterns  of pregnanes  production  previously  noted in  the Rutales,  and a significant  chemotaxonomic  evi-  dence in favour of the link between  these three famil-  ies.
