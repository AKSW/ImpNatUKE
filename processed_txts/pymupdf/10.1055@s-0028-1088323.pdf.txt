This flagel- late protozoan is the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, an illness that affects 16–18 million peo- ple in Central and South America, and led to 14,470 deaths in 2002 [1]. At the moment, blood transfusion is one of the most important ways of transmission of this disease. However, gentian violet, the only trypanocidal substance available to prevent the infection by this route, shows limi- ted use due to undesirable effects on the patients [2]. Furthermore, the treatment of Chagas' dis- ease is still insufficient since the two available drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, can only be used for the early chronic phase of the illness. Ac- cording to the World Heatlh Organization (WHO), discovery and development of more effective and better tolerated drugs are still research challenges [3]. Thus, the search for both a prophylactic drug to be added to human blood as well as a safe and reliable therapeutic drug is needed. In this context, higher plants are a potential source of compounds with high activity and low toxicity [4], [5]. In fact, the investigation of these compounds has received increasing attention in the past years [6] and several active natural prod- ucts have been identified as trypanocides [4], [5], [7], [8], [9]. We have investigated plants from the order Ru- tales with the aim to identify biologically active compounds. We have also found that a number of natural products from Meliaceae and Rutaceae showed in vitro activity against T. cruzi [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Moreover, the Melia- ceae family has been pointed out as an important source of lead trypanocidal compounds [10], [14], [17], [18]. So, due to this high biological potential, we chose to investigate the species Cedrela fissilis, to search for new trypanocidal compounds. In this paper, we report the trypanocidal activity of 15 crude extracts, and 14 compounds includ- ing limonoids and triterpenes from Cedrela fissilis. We also describe the identification of 25 compounds (6 limonoids, 12 triterpenes, 1 ses- quiterpene, 5 steroids, and 1 flavonoid) from this species for the first time. Materials and Methods � General procedures Compounds were identified through NMR and low resolution EI-MS, which were acquired on Bruker DRX 400 and on Micromass Quattro LC in- struments, respectively. Abstract � Chagas' disease is an illness that affects millions of people in Central and South America. The search for both a prophylactic drug to be added to human blood as well as a safe and reliable therapeutic drug are greatly needed to control such disease. Herein, we report the trypanocidal activity of 15 crude extracts and 14 compounds (limonoids and triterpenes) as well as the isola- tion of 25 known compounds (6 limonoids,12 tri- terpenes,1 sesquiterpene, 5 steroids, and 1 flavo- noid) from Cedrela fissilis. The present study shows that this plant is a promising source of ac- tive compounds for the control of Chagas' dis- ease. The inhibitory activity found for odoratol indicates that it is potentially useful as an alter- native for the chemoprophylactic gentian vio- let. Leite ACet al.

Plant material Fruits, branches, stems, roots and leaves from Cedrela fissilis Vell. were collected in São Carlos-SP, Brazil, on 01/06/01 and identi- fied by Dr. Maria Inês Salgueiro Lima from the Department of Botany, UFSCar, SP where a voucher specimen (6701) was depos- ited at that department. Extraction and isolation The powdered air-dried parts of C. fissilis were extracted three times (72 h) by maceration with hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The hexane extract from the roots of C. fissilis (RH, 3.5 g) was submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (70–230 mesh, 6×18 cm) using 1.5 L of the solvents hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The dichloromethane fraction (RHD, 834.1 mg) was chromatographed on silica gel (70–230 mesh, 4×45 cm), eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone (8:1.5:0.5) to give 9 fractions. Fraction 2 (RHD-2, 290.5 mg) was fractionated twice on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×40 cm), using hexane- CH2Cl2-acetone (8:1.5:0.5) to yield compound 19 (28.0 mg). Several column chromatographies on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 4×40 cm, eluent hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 6:3:1) and Sephadex LH-20 (3×50 cm, eluent MeOH) of the acetate ethyl fraction (RHA, 704.8 mg) allowed the isolation of the triterpene 18 (11.5 mg). The dichloromethane extract from roots (RD, 1.0 g) was fractio- nated through column chromatography on silica gel (70– 230 mesh, 4×45 cm), eluting with hexane to MeOH, to afford nine fractions. Limonoid 1 (12.1 mg) was obtained from fraction 5 (RD-5, 143.0 mg) through three successive chromatography columns on silica gel (70–230 and 230–400 mesh, 3×40 cm) and gradient elution (hexane to MeOH and hexane-CH2Cl2-ace- tone, 6:3:1). Fraction 6 (RD-6, 192.0 mg) was fractionated twice on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×50 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2- acetone (6:3:1) to yield compounds 3 (1.3 mg) and 10 (1.1 mg). The dichloromethane extract from leaves (LD, 29.0 g) was sub- mitted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (70– 230 mesh, 6×18 cm) using 2 L of the solvents hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The dichloromethane fraction (LD-D, 6.0 g) was chromatographed on silica gel (230–400 mesh) and florisil (1:1, 4.5×50 cm) using a gradient elution (hexane to MeOH) to afford 12 fractions. From fraction 4 (LD-D-4, 1.2 g), after two col- umn chromatographies on silica (70–230 mesh, 4×45 cm, elu- ent hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3.5:0.5) and HPLC on silica Hyper- sil 5 μm column (1×29 cm), with hexane-2-propanol (8.5:1.5) isocratic elution and UV detection at 240 nm, limonoid 2 (5.1 mg) was isolated. Fraction 7 (LD-D-7, 800.3 mg) was chro- matographed twice on silica gel (70–230 mesh, 3×45 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3.5:0.5) to yield compound 5 (3.5 mg). The chromatographic separation of fraction 9 (LD-D-9, 1.0 g) by column chromatography (silica gel 70–230 mesh, 3×35 cm, elu- ent hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 7:2:1) and normal HPLC (Hypersil 5 μm column, 1×29 cm, hexane-2-propanol 9:1, UV detection at 220 nm) afforded limonoids 4 (9.3 mg) and 6 (4.5 mg). The methanol extract from stems (SM, 40.0 g) was submitted to liquid-liquid partition chromatography with hexane-MeOH- H2O, CH2Cl2-MeOH-H2O, EtOAc-MeOH-H2O, and n-butanol- MeOH-H2O. The hexane and dichloromethane fractions (SM- HD, 11.8 g) were chromatographed on Sephadex LH-20 (4×50 cm) using CH2Cl2-MeOH (1:1) as eluent to give 10 fractions. Several chromatographic procedures on silica (230–400 mesh, 4×40 cm) and cromatotron of fraction 2 (SM-2, 2.3 g), using both isocratic (hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3.5:0.5) and gradient elution (CH2Cl2 until MeOH), allowed the isolation of 7 (35.6 mg), 8 (40.2 mg), and 14 (32.7 mg). Fraction 4 (SM-4, 3.5 g) was submitted to two column chromatographies on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 4×45 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 9.5:0.5) and cromatotron, with a hexane-CH2Cl2-MeOH (6:3:1) elution, to afford 11 (33.5 mg) and 12 (23.1 mg). Compounds 9 (10.1 mg) and 13 (13.2 mg) were obtained from fraction 7 (SM-7, 2.1 g) through column chromatography on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 4×40 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 9.5:0.5) and cromatotron (eluent hexane- CH2Cl2-MeOH, 6:3:1). The dichloromethane extract from fruits (FD, 5.0 g) was submit- ted to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel (230– 400 mesh, 6×18 cm) using 1.5 L of CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and MeOH. The ethyl acetate fraction (FDA, 3.0 g) was submitted to column chromatography on silica gel (70–230 mesh, 4×45 cm) using a gradient elution (hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone, 6:3:1) to yield 7 frac- tions. Fraction 2 (FDA-2, 715.0 mg) was twice chromatographed on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×40 cm) using hexane-CH2Cl2- acetone (6:3:1) to afford compounds 16 (36.5 mg) and 17 (25.9 mg). The triterpene 15 (4.3 mg) was obtained through col- umn chromatography on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 1.5×20 cm, eluent hexane-EtOAc, 7:3) and Sephadex LH-20 (1.5×30 cm, eluent CH2Cl2-MeOH, 1:1) from fraction 3 (FDA-3, 633.2 mg). Finally, the flavonoid 20 (48.9 mg) was isolated from the metha- nol extract from fruits (FM) through several column chromatog- raphies on silica gel (230–400 mesh, 3×35 cm, eluent hexane until MeOH) and Sephadex-LH-20 (1.5×30 cm, eluent MeOH). Bioassay The procedure for in vitro assays on blood trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi was previously described by Ambrozin et al. [10]. Di- methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to prepare standard solu- tions of the crude extracts and compounds, which were added to the infected mouse blood to provide concentrations of 4 mg/ mL and 50, 100, and 250 μg/mL, respectively. The final concen- tration of DMSO was 1% (v/v). The bioassays were performed in triplicate on titration microplates (96 wells) that were incubated at 4°C for 24 h. The activity is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite number (lysis) and IC50 (μmol/L) for pure com- pounds were calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0. Results and Discussion � In the present work, we assessed the trypanocidal activity of 15 extracts from fruits, branches, stems, roots and leaves of C. fissilis. The results, which are summarized in ● � Table 1, showed that 11 extracts (73%) were significantly active (lysis% ≥ 50) at 4 mg/mL against the trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. Moreover, nine of them presented lysis in the 60–80% range; the dichloro- methane extract of roots (RD) was the most active, reducing the number of parasites in the infected blood by 97.4%. Such results suggest that C. fissilis is really a promising source of trypanocidal compounds, as we expected from the previous works that had reported the antiprotozoal action of Meliaceae plants [10], [14], [16], [17], [18]. Thus, we carried out the chemical investigation of C. fissilis with the aim to isolate the compounds from some ac- tive extracts (RD, LD, FD, FM, and SM), and one inactive extrtact (RH). This work allowed the isolation of the limonoids (● � Fig. 1): Original Paper 1796 Leite ACet al. Trypanocidal Activity of… Planta Med 2008; 74: 1795–1799 Downloaded by: University of Queensland. Copyrighted material. 3β-acetoxycarapin (1) [19], 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin (2) [20], gedunin (3) [20], photogedunin (4), methyl angolensate (5), and 20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone (6) [20]; the triter- penes: hispidol A (7), piscidinol A (8), pentaol (9), nilocetin (10), odoratol (11), iso-odoratol (12), odoratone (13), 22S,3α-di- hydrotirucala-7,24-dien-23-one (14), 3,11-dioxoolean-12-en-28- onic acid (15), oleanonic acid (16) [19], oleanolic acid (17) [19], and 24-methylene-26-hydroxycycloartan-3-one (18); the sequi- terpene criptomeridiol (19); the flavonoid ent-catechin (20); in addition to the steroids β-sitosterol, stigmaterol, campesterol, sitostenone, and 3β-O-β-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol. Fourteen compounds were assayed in vitro against the trypo- mastigote forms of T. cruzi (● � Table 2). The results showed that the tirucallane-type triterpenes (7–13) were the most active ones. The results in ● � Table 2 show that the trypanocidal activi- ty of odoratol (11) was better than that of gentian violet, the pos- itive control, when we compared the evaluated concentrations. This triterpene was isolated from the methanol extract from stems (SM, 58.0%), together with the tirucallane triterpenes his- pidol A (7), piscidinol A (8), pentaol (9), iso-odoratol (12), odor- atone (13) and 22S,3α-dihydrotirucala-7,24-dien-23-one (14).

Copyrighted material. a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran seem to enhance the trypanocidal activity of tirucallane triterpenes. So, odoratol (11) and iso-odor- atol (12) showed higher activity than hispidol A (7) and odora- tone (13). On the other hand, odoratone (13) was more active than piscidinol A (8). In general, oleanane-type triterpenes (15–17) were more active than limonoids (1–4), but less active than tirucallane triter- penes (7–13). They were isolated from the active dichlorome- thane extract from fruits of C. fissilis (FD, 75.4%) together with photogedunin (4). Among them, oleanolic acid (17) showed the highest activity displaying an IC50 value of 80.4 μM, which is near to the one observed for gentian violet [21]. It seems that for this class of compounds the trypanocidal activity is related to the presence of a hydroxy group at C-3. This observation cor- roborates the statement by Cunha et al [21], [22] that the free hydroxy at C-3 and the polarity of C-28 are the most influential structural features for the in vitro trypanocidal activity of olea- nane triterpenes. Besides anti-inflammatory, immunomodulato- ry, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimutagenic, antihepatotoxic, anti- diabetic, hemolytic, antiviral and antibacterial activity [23], the trypanocidal action of oleanane triterpenes has already been de- scribed previously [21], [22], [24], [25], [26]. Actually, oleanolic acid (17) showed trypanocidal activity on both trypomastigote [21], [25] and epimastigote forms [24], [26] of T. cruzi. Mexicanolide and gedunin-type limonoids (1–4) showed low trypanocidal activity. In a previous work, mexicanolide limo- noids displayed only weak activity on trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi [14]. These results suggest that tirucallane-type triterpenes are a promising class of new trypanocidal compounds. The high try- panocidal activity of odoratol (11) (100% at 100 μg/mL) indicates that it has potential as an alternative for the chemoprophylactic gentian violet, which has many side effects [2]. However, toxicity assays have not been performed for 11 yet. In conclusion, the present study showed that C. fissilis, a plant from the Meliaceae family, is a promising source of active com- pounds for control of Chagas' disease. Specifically, we demon- strate the potential activity of tirucallane and oleanane-type tri- terpenes. The high activity of odoratol (11) is promising although it asks for further optimization and for assessment of toxicity.
