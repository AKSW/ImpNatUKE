Abstract-Four  quinoline  alkaloids  were isolated from stems of Gnlipea bracteata. In addition  to one new compound,  2-(3’,4’-methylenedioxyphenylethyl)-quinoline,  three were identified as the known compounds  2+propylquinoline,  2-  n-pentylquinoline  and 2-(l’-pentenyl)-quinoline.  However,  this is the first report  of their isolation  from a natural  source. All alkaloids  showed an inhibitory  effect on shoot and root growth of lettuce (Lactuca satiua). Three of them  also showed  molluscicidal  activity against the aquatic  snail, Biomphalaria  glabrata, involved  in the transmission  of  schistosomiasis.  INTRODUCTION  The Rutaceae  is represented  by a great number of species  in tropical  areas. Many of these species have never been  the target of a phytochemical  investigation.  In our con-  tinuing  effort to find biologically  active compounds  we  have investigated  G&pea  bracteata.  In this paper  we  report the isolation and identification  of one new alkaloid  and three  known  ones from G. bracteata  collected  in  Minas Gerais, Brazil. The growth inhibitory  effect against  lettuce  of the alkaloids,  as well as, their molluscicidal  activity are also described.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The dichloromethane  extract  of the stems of G. bracteata  afforded four alkaloids  14. The combination  of various  routine  ‘H, 13C NMR and mass spectrometric  analyses  allowed us to attribute  the formulas C,,H,,N.  C,,H,,N.  C,,H,,N  and C,,H,,NO,  to compounds  14, respect-  ively. ‘H NMR (Table 1) showed signals of six aromatic  protons  for all compounds  at 67.24 f0.04,  d, J= 8.5 Hz,  H-3; 68.02kO.02  d, J=8.5  Hz, H-4; 67.74kO.02,  dd, .I  =7.8,  1.2 Hz, H-5; 67.47+0.04,  td, J=7.8,  1.2 Hz, H-6;  S7.66kO.04,  td, J=7.8,  1.2 Hz, H-7 and 68.01 +O.Ol, d, .I  = 7.8, H-8. An exception  was the signal corresponding  to  H-3 of compound  3 at 67.51. The similarities  of the  chemical shifts and multiplicities  for the four compounds  suggest  that  a 2-substituted  quinoline  system  is the  structural  basis for all compounds,  and that the difference  between  them is the type of substituent  attached  to C-2.  Compound  1 possesses  a n-propyl  moiety characterized  by the signals in the ‘HNMR  at 62.91 (t), 61.81 (sext, J  * Permanent  address:  Departamento  de Quimica,  Universi-  dade Federal  de Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, SP, CEP 13560, Brazil.  = 7.4 Hz), 60.91 (t), integrating  2: 2: 3, respectively.  Con-  firmation  of this unit can be taken from the 13CNMR  signals at 641.30,23.25 and 13.99, which can be attributed  to C-l’, C-2’ and C-3’, respectively.  Compounds  2 and 3 are very closely related  to each  other and to compound  1. The mass spectra showed the  parent peak at m/z 199 and 197 for 2 and 3 respectively,  indicating  that the difference  between  2 and 3 is two  hydrogen  atoms. Analysis of the ‘H NMR of both com-  pounds showed that 2 has two more signals in the olefinic  region C66.80 (td) and 66.70 (d)] than 3 and revealed the  presence  of a trans-substituted  double  bond  in 3. The  signal of four aliphatic  protons  at 61.30 (m) for 2 was  observed,  which corresponds  to two methylene  carbons.  The 13CNMR  for compounds  2 and 3 showed  14  signals. For 2 there were five signals at high field indi-  cating a n-pentyl moiety. However,  for 3 there were only  three signals in this region. These data indicate that 2 has  a n-pentyl  chain  attached  to C-2 and that 3 has the  corresponding  pentenyl  chain.  Compound  4 is related  to the three compounds  de-  scribed above. Analysis of its ‘H and 13CNMR  spectra  reveals that, in addition  to the quinoline  ring, there is  another  aromatic  ring present  in the molecule.  The tri-  substituted  nature of this ring is confirmed  by the signals  66.72 (d, 5=1.2  Hz), 66.69 (d, J=7.8  Hz), 66.65 (dd, J  1  R=\;f\  3  813  814  P. C. WEIRA and I.

The presence  of a piperonyl  moiety is  once more confirmed  by the mass spectrum  which show-  ed a peak at m/z 135. The parent peak of m/z 217 requires  a methylenedioxyphenylethyl  as the substituent  of this  quinoline.  The complete  assignment  of chemical shifts for  all carbons  are given  in Table 2. The compounds  2-  methyl (5) and 2-aminoquinoline  (6) were used as models  c121.  The alkaloids  isolated showed inhibitory  effects on the  growth  of lettuce seedlings  and molluscicidal  activity as  determined  according  to the methods  described  pre-  viously  [3,4].  All compounds  at concentrations  larger  than 500ppm inhibited  both shoot and root growth in the  lettuce test. At lower concentrations  their activities were  diminished.  When  the concentration  was decreased  to  100 ppm, only compounds  3 and 4 showed activity but at  this concentration.  1 and 2 had no activity.  Molluscicidal  activity  was exhibited  by compounds  2-4. Compound  1 was not molluscicidal  even at 100 ppm.  Compound  4 had the most powerful molluscicidal  activ-  ity killing snails at a concentration  of only 5 ppm. Com-  pounds  2 and 3 possessed  activities  at 20 and 10 ppm,  respectively.  Our  results  suggest  that  the presence  of a second  aromatic  ring at C-2 increases  the activity  of the com-  pounds,  and that the activity  of 2-alkylquinolines  de-  pends on the length of the alkyl chain. It is important  to  note that very few examples  of naturally  occurring  alka-  loids have been found to exhibit  molluscicidal  activity  [S]. although  recently,  some potent  molluscicidal  alka-  loids were isolated from members  of the Meliaceae  [S]. It  is also important  to mention  that few species of the genus  Gu/ipeu have been studied. However, in a unique example  presented  by Mester  [7], the alkaloids  isolated  were 7-  substituted  quinolines.  We suspect that there should be a  tendency  for this genus to produce  this class of com-  pound.  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation  of constituents.  Galipea hracteata  was collected  in  Minas Gerais, Brazil; a voucher is deposited  in the Herbarium  of  Institute  de Biociencias.  USP, Sao Paulo.  Dried stems (920 g)  were extd with CH,CI,  at room temp. for 4 days. The ext was  evapd to dryness yielding (5.567 g) ofcrude  extract. A portion  of  this ext (1.463 g) was chromatographed  over silica gel (50 g) and  eluted with solvents of increasing  polarity  (CH,CI,,  EtOAc and  MeOH). Alkaloids  were found in frs 16.-35. They were then sepd  by low pressure chromatography  on silica gel (Lichroprep)  using  hexane-EtOAc  (49: l), affording  I (31 mg), 2 (IOmg). 3 (15 mg)  and 4 (I 13 mg).
