Abstract-The  branches  of the shrub  Aniba lancifolia  Kubitzki  et Rodrigues  (Lauraceae)  contain  besides  2-  hydroxy-4,5-dimethoxyallylbenzene  and  its dimer  cyclohexan-2-allyl-5-en-4,5-dimethoxy-4-0-(2’-allyl-4’,5’-  dimethoxyphenyl)-l-one  (lancilin,  2) 6 further  novel  neolignans:  (4S,2’R)-  and (4R,2’E)-cyclohexan-2-allyl-  2,5-dien-4,5-dimethoxy-4-[2’-(l’-guaiacyl)-propyl]-l-one  (lancifolins  A and  B, 3a and 3b), (4S,2’R)-  and  (4R,2’R)-cyclohexan-2-allyl-2,5-dien-4,5-dimethoxy-4-[2’-(l’-vera~l)-propyl]-l-one  (lancifolins  C and D, 3c  and 3d),  (4S,2’R)-  and (4R,2’R)-cyclohexan-2-allyl-2,5-dien-4.5-dimethoxy-4-[2’-(l’-piperonyl)-propyl]-l-one  (lancifolins  E and F, 3e and 31).  INFRODUCTION  Aniba lancifofia  Kubitzki  et Rodrigues,  to date known  only from the type locality  130 km north of Manaus,  is  the sole species  of its genus  with shrubby  habit  and  broadly  cordate  leaf  bases.  The  rocky  campina  in  which it was discovered  would  merit to be preserved  as a relic, due not only to the very peculiar  charac-  teristics  of its vegetation,  but also to the wealth  of  endemic  and rare species.  Unfortunately,  this area is  at present  being irreversibly  destroyed,  as many others  in Amazonia  [2].  Branches  of the  shrub  were  found  to contain  a  simple  allylbenzene  (la)  together  with 7 related  com-  pounds  belonging  to two  novel  neolignan  types  in  which two allylbenzene  units are linked either  head to  head by a 2.0.3’ bridge (lanciiin type, 2) or tail to head  by a 8.3’ bridge  (lancifolin  type, 3).  Systematic  nomenclature,  which we have used so far  for neolignans  (cf. [3] and previous  papers),  detracts  from the fact that, in spite of diversity  of skeletons  and  functions,  they  form  a  singularly  homogeneous  biogenetic  group  of natural  compounds.  This homo-  geneity  is honoured  in a system  of nomenclature  and  numbering  outlined  in a recent  review  [4] which  is  adopted  in the present  paper.  RESULTS AND D-ION  Compound  la, CL1H1.,03, was characterized  as a  hydroxy-dimethoxyallylbenzene  by ‘H NMR.  In this  *Part  54  in  the  series  ‘The  Chemistry  of  Brazilian  Lauraceae’.  For Part  53 see ref. [l].  Based  on part of the  Doctorate  thesis presented  by P. P. D.

Among  the three  possible  alternatives,  the  meta-dimethoxy  structure  can be excluded  by MS evidence.  Intense  M’-15  and  M’-15-28  peaks  are  typical  of  ortho-  and  para-  dimethoxybenzenes  [5]. From  the remaining  alterni-  tives la was selected  by analysis of the ‘H NMR shifts  upon  acetylation  which  are  closely  comparable  to  analogous  shifts  for  lb [6] (A6  la/lb: CH2  OH  R20  la  R’=R2=Me  1 b RI-R2 = CH,  -O.l/-0.1,  H-3  +0.33/+0.27,  H-6  -0.08/-0.07).  The  recognition  of 2-hydroxy-4,5-dimethoxyallyl-  benzene  as a constituent  of the species proved  biosyn-  thetically  significant.  Indeed,  the additional  constituent  Ian&in  (2), G2Ha0,,,  is simply  a dimer  of la, as  shown  by the MS which, besides  the M’ peak (1% rel.  int.),  shows  only  peaks  for  the  monomer  ([C11H1403]+.,  formed  by a 1,4-hydrogen  rearrange-  ment,  lOO%), and by acid hydrolysis  which leads only  to la. This evidence  is compatible  with the formula-  tion of Ian&in  as the biogenetically  reasonable  ketal  2. ‘H NMR data fully confirm  this proposal  and indi-  cate the axial conformation  of H-l’ [S H-2’ ax 1.68 (I,  .I = 12 and 12 Hz), H-2’ eq 2.2 (dd, J = 12 and 4 Hz)].  All  further  isolates  can  be  considered  oxidative  coupling  products  of  la with  ethers  of  3,4-  dihydroxypropenylbenzene.  The MS of all lancifolins  285  288  P. P. DIAZ D., M.
