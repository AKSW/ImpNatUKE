LIULKU; Leguminosae  - Papilionoideae;  7,3’-dihydroxy-8,4’-  dimethoxyisoflavones:  isoflavone  evolution.  Abstract--Monopteryx  input contains  six 5,7-dihydroxyisoflavones,  three of which, such as the novel 5,7-dihydroxy-  8,3’,4’-trimethoxy  derivative, have additionally  methoxyls  on ring A. All three isoflavones  of M. UUU~U are, by contrast,  7-hydroxy-S-methoxy  derivatives.  From  the chemical  standpoint,  the former  species  thus appears  to be more  primitive  than the latter.  The genus Monoptrryx  Spr. ex Benth. (tribe Sophoreae,  LeguminosaeePapilionoideae)  was thought  to comprise  in Brazil M. uuucu  Spr. ex Benth. and M. Llngusti@u  Spr.  ex Benth. [2] and in Venezuela  M. jahnii  PIttier [3].  Recently,  however,  an additional  species,  ~zil. inpcrr W.  Rodr.,  was described  [3] and it became  desirable  to  examine  the chemical  affinity of the new species with at  least M. uaucu,  by far the more common  and widespread  of the two formerly  known Brazilian species.  M. inpue  and ,!4. tuucu are  trees  which may attain  considerable  proportions.  Their freshly cut trunk woods  are reported  to possess  respectively  coumarin  [3] and  balsamic [2] odour. The C,H,  extracts  of wood samples  from both species contain  elemicin,  accompanied  in the  latter  species  by methyleugenol,  methylchavicol  and  anethole,  besides flavonoids  (Table I ). The identification  of the Ravanone  1 and of the isofavones  2a-2h relied on  spectral  analyses  and comparisons  of data obtained  for  the compounds,  as well as for their methyl ethers  and  acetates, with the pertinent  published  data. The presence  of a methoxyl  flanked by two ortho substituents  in 2f was  confirmed  by 13C NMR:  one  of the  methyl  peaks  appeared  at lower field (OMe-8,  6 61.1) than the other  (OMe-4’, 6 55.2) [l I 1. The location  of the lone aromatic  A-ring  proton  of the previously  unknown  2e was deduced  by its NMR  chemical  shift  (66.36)  which  is compatible  with ii 6.32 for H-6 in the known 2d, as compared  to b 6.53  for H-8 in the equally  known  2c [all measurements  in  Table 1.
