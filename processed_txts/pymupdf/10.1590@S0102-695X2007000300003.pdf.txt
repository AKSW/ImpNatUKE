ABSTRACT: Chromatographic fractionation of the organic extract from leaves of Ouratea  multiﬂ ora afforded the ﬂ avone dimers heveaﬂ avone, amentoﬂ avone-7′′,4′′′-dimethyl eter,  podocarpusﬂ avone-A and amentoﬂ avone. Their structures were elucidated from spectral data,  including 2D-NMR experiments of the natural substances. Biological activities of all isolates  were evaluated, using antimicrobial assay against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus  and Bacillus subtilis, cytotoxicity assay against mouse lymphoma (L5178) and KB cell lines,  TLC screening for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and antioxidant activity measured by DPPH  test.  Keywords: Ochnaceae, Ouratea multiﬂ ora, biﬂ avonoids, antibacterial activity. INTRODUCTION   Species of the Ochnaceae family are distributed  in tropical and subtropical zones throughout the  World (Hegnauer, 1969; Carvalho et al., 2000) This  family is characterized by the presence of ﬂ avonoids  and biﬂ avonoids and terpenoids as main secondary  metabolites (Oliveira et al., 2002; Estevam et al 2005).  Several members of the Ouratea genus are employed  for the extraction of edible oil, and are used as medicinal  plants (Moreira et al., 1994; Agra et al., 2007). As part  of our research program on the bioactive constituents  of Atlantic Forest plant species, we have investigated  Ouratea multiﬂ ora collected in Juréia Reserve, São Paulo  State. As result, four ﬂ avonoid dimers: heveaﬂ avone  (Geiger, 1986) amentoﬂ avone-7′′,4′′′-dimethyl-ether  (Geiger, 1986), podocarpusﬂ avone-A (Geiger, 1986;  Markham et al., 1987) and amentoﬂ avone (Geiger,  1986; Markham et al., 1987; Felício et al., 2001),  were isolated from the ethanolic extract of the leaves.  Additionally, the biological activity of the isolates was  also evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS General procedure 1H and  13C NMR, inverse heteronuclear  HMQC and HMBC as well as COSY experiments were  performed on a Varian Inova 500 MHz instrument  operating at 500 MHz for hydrogen, and 125 MHz for  carbon, respectively. Pyridine-d5 or DMSO-d6 were  used as solvents and TMS as internal standard. TLC was  performed on precoated aluminum sheets (silica F254,  0.25 mm, Merck, Parmtadt, Germany) with detection  provided by UV light (254 and 366 nm) and by spraying  with anisaldeyde reagent followed by heating (120 °C).  Silica gel (230-400 mesh ASTM, particle size 0.040- 0.063 µM, Merck) or Sephaex LH-20 (Pharmacia) were  used in the CC fractionations. Plant material Ouratea multiﬂ ora was collected at the  Botanical reserve of Juréia, São Paulo, Brazil and a  320 Carlos Alberto Carbonezi, Lidilhone Hamerski, A. A. Leslie Gunatilaka, et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 17(3): Jul./Set. 2007 voucher was placed at the Botanical Institute, São Paulo  State, Brazil. Extraction and isolation   Dried powdered leaves of Ouratea multiﬂ ora  (118.0 g) were extracted by maceration using ethanol at  room temperature. The extract was ﬁ ltered and the solvent  was removed under vacuum. The crude extract (3.44 g)  was dissolved in n-BuOH. Subsequent addition of water  afforded two phases which were evaporated to dryness  under reduced pressure. The n-BuOH fraction (2.10  g) was solubilized with methanol/water (8:2 v/v) and  partitioned with n-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate,  successively. The ethyl acetate phase after concentration  of the solvent (980.0 mg), was chromatographed on  a Sephadex LH-20 column with a gradient elution of  MeOH/H2O. The separation was monitored by TLC,  and eluted fractions exhibiting similar appearances  were combined, yielding 20 fractions. Fractions 7 and 8  showed a solid precipitation. The solid was washed with  cold methanol to afford heveaﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986) (1)  (21.2 mg). Fraction 13 was chromatographed on silica  gel yielding amentoﬂ avone 7”, 4”’-dimethyl ether (2)  (10.8 mg). Fraction 15 gave a powder after precipitation.  This powder was washed with cold methanol to afford  podocarpusﬂ avone-A 3 (Markam et al., 1987) (8.9 mg).  Fraction 17 was chromatographed on silica gel using  CHCl3:MeOH (4:6) yielding amentoﬂ avone 4 (Geiger,  1986; Markham et al., 1987) (15.0 mg). Antimicrobial assay Sterile ﬁ lter paper disks were impregnated with  20 mg of samples using DMSO as carrier solvent. The  impregnated disks were then placed on agar plates  previously inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus  (ATCC 2592) and Bacillus subtilis (DSM 2105). Solvent  controls were incubated at 37 oC for each organism,  and after incubate time of 24 h at 37 oC, antimicrobial  activity was recorded as clear zones (in mm) of inhibition  surrounding the disk. The sample was considered active  when the inhibition surrounding the disk was greater  than 7 mm. Cytotoxicity assay Antiproliferative activity was examined against  two cell lines and was determined through an MTT  assay as described earlier (Edrada et al., 1996). TLC screening for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors The protocol adopted for this in vitro assay is  described by Ellman and co-workers (Ellman et al.,  1961). Determination of the radical-scavenging activity The determination of the antioxidant activity was  tested according to a protocol described elsewhere  (Cardoso et al., 2004; So; Lewis, 2002).

Pharmacogn. 17(3): Jul./Set. 2007 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The chromatographic fractionation of the ethanol  extract from the leaves of O. multiﬂ ora afforded  heveaﬂ avone (1), amentoﬂ avone-7′′,4′′′-dimethyl-ether  (2), podocarpusﬂ avone-A (3), and amentoﬂ avone (4).   The  13C NMR spectrum of compound 1  showed 31 signals, which were attributed to twelve  sp2 CH, including signals at δCH 114.1 and 127.6, each  representing two carbon atoms, three sp3 carbons (δCH3  55.1, 55.5 and 55.9), sixteen sp2 quaternary carbons and  two carbonyl groups (δC 181.6 and 182.2) (Table 2).

A. Leslie Gunatilaka, et al. Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J. Pharmacogn. 17(3): Jul./Set. 2007 The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals for two chelated  hydroxyls at δH 13.19 and 12.93 (OH-5 and OH-5”),  three aromatic methoxyl groups, a 1,3,4-trisubstituted  aromatic ring (B ring) and a 1,4-disubstituted (B’ ring).  The 1H NMR spectra [1D and 2D (1H-1H-COSY)] showed  a para-substituted aromatic ring at δH 7.55 (d, J 9.0 Hz,  H-2”’, H-6”’), δH 6.82 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’), two  meta aromatic hydrogens at δH 6.23 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-6),  6.49 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-8), commonly observed in a ﬂ avone  nucleous. The structure of 1 was established on the basisi  of HMBC spectra, which showed heteronuclear long- range couplings of quaternary carbons C-7’’ (δC 161.2),  C-7 (δC 164.8) and C-4”’ (δC 162.4) with the hydrogens  of methoxyl groups at δH 3.72 (OMe-7’’), 3.77 (OMe-7),  and 3.81 (OMe-4”’), respectively, and by comparison of  their spectral data with those reported for heveaﬂ avone  (Geiger, 1986). Compound 2 also showed spectral features of  a ﬂ avonoid dimer derivative (Table 2). The 1H MNR  spectrum (Table 1) of 2 showed the presence of to  chelated hydroxyl and at δH 3.83 and δH 3.75 two  methoxyl groups. The  1H-1H-COSY spectrum of  compound 2 showed a set of doublets at δH 7.66 (d, J 9.5  Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’) and δH 6.91 (d, J 9.5 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’)  of  an AA’BB’ system, besides the signals at δH 7.98 (d,  J 2.5 Hz, H-2’), 7.14 (d, J 8.5, H-5’) and 8.01 (dd, J 8.5;  2.5, H-6’) attributed to a 1,3,4-trisubstituted aromatic  ring. Furthermore, the 1H-1H-COSY spectrum showed  signals with a meta coupling pattern at δH 6.17 (d, J  2.5 Hz, H-6) and 6.45 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-8) corresponding  to an A ring of  a ﬂ avone. The  HMBC spectrum of 2  revealed correlations of the hydrogen-bonded OH-5 (δH  12.94) with C-5 (δC 161.4), C-6 (δC 98.8) and C-10 (δC  103.7), while OH-5” (δH 13.20) correlated with C-5” (δC  161.4), C-6” (δC 95.6) and C-10” (δC 104.2). From the  long range coupling of H-6 (δH 6.17) and H-3 (δH 6.82)  with C-10 (δC 103.7); H-3”’ and H-5”’ (δH 6.91) with C- 1”’ (δC 122.9); and H-3” (δH 6.92) with C-10” (δC 104.2)  thus, the structure of 2 was established to be a dimer. A  literature search conﬁ rmed the structure of 2 as 7”,4”’- dimethoxy-amentoﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986). 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 3 showed signals at δH  13.05, δC 182.2, δH 12.95, and δC 181.8 of two hydrogen  of chelated hydroxyl groups, and an O-methyl group  at δH 3.74 (δC 55.5). A detailed analysis of cross peaks  from the 1H-1H COSY spectrum showed two doublets  for a mono-oxygenated para disubstituted system at  δH 7.65 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’) and 6.91 (d, J 9.0  Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’), one trioxygenated tetra substituted  ring with alternating oxy-substituents at δH 6.17 (d, J  1.5 Hz, H-6) and δH 6.45 (d, J 1.5 Hz, H-8), and one  mono-oxygenated trisubstituted system at δH 7.98 (d, J  2.5 Hz, H-2’), 7.15 (d, J 8.5 Hz, H-5’) and 8.00 (dd, J  8.5; 2.5 Hz, H-6’). Additional 1D and 2D NMR data  indicated a pentasubstituted aromatic ring with a 5,7- dioxygenation pattern for the A’ ring of a ﬂ avone (δH  6.41, H-6”) and two singlets (δH 6.81 (H-3), δH 6.86  (H-3’’) of both ﬂ avones units in compound 3. Analysis  of HMBC spectra revealed characteristic correlations  which deﬁ ned the positions of aromatic rings and their  substitution patterns. Correlations of H-3 (δ 6.81) with  C-2 (δ 163.8), C-4 (δ 181.7), C-10 (δ 103.7), C-1’ (δ  121.1) and H-3” (δ 6.86) with C-2” (δ 163.2), C-4” (δ  182.2), C-10” (δ 103.7), C-1”’ (δ 123.0) established the  linkages between rings C/B and C”/B”, respectively.  Moreover, the correlation between H-2’ (δ 7.98) and C- 8” (δ 104.0) showed the linkage between C-3’and C-8”.  The ROESY correlation observed between methoxyl  group at δH 3.74 and the aromatic protons at δH 6.91 (d, J  9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’) justify the location of the methoxyl  group at C-4”’ of the B’ aromatic ring. These data are in  agreement with those published for podocarpusﬂ avone- A (Geiger, 1986; Markham, et al., 1987). 1H NMR spectrum of 4 showed two signals at δH  13.09 and 12.96 due to chelated phenolic hydroxyls, and  two doublets at δH 7.56 (J 9.0 Hz, H-2”’, H-6”’), and  6.70 (J 9.0 Hz, H-3”’, H-5”’) assigned to an AA’BB’  aromatic system. Signals of a trisubstituted aromatic  ring containing one oxygenated carbon were observed  at δH 8.00 (d, J 2.5 Hz, H-2’), 7.14 (d, J 9.0 Hz, H-5’),  and 7.99 (dd, J 9.0; 2.5 Hz H-6’), along with doublets  of a tetrasubstituted aromatic ring containing three  oxygenated carbons at δH 6.18 (J 2.5 Hz, H-6) and  6.45 (J 2.5 Hz, H-8). Analysis of the HMBC spectra  evidenced correlations of the hydroxyl group with  hydrogen bonded by cross peak at δH 13.09 (OH-5)  with C-5” (δ 161.1), C-6” (δ 98.7), and C-10” (δ 103.6)  and δH 12.96 (OH-5”) with C-5 (δ 162.1), C-6 (δ 98.9)  and C-10 (δ 103.7), which are in agreement to those of  amentoﬂ avone (Geiger, 1986; Markham et al., 1987). Previous   studies  on  13C NMR data for  amenthoﬂ avone derivative dimers indicated a close  relationship between substituent effects and chemical shift  for the inter-ﬂ avonoid linkage: a) amenthoﬂ avones; I-3’  (+ 6 ppm), II-8’’ (+ 10 ppm), b) dihydroamenthoﬂ avone;  I-3’(+ 4 ppm), II-8” (+ 9 ppm), which can be diagnostic  values in the recognition of new biﬂ avones in the  amenthoﬂ avone series (Markhan, et al., 1987; Felício, et  al., 2001). The values of 13C NMR spectra of 1-4 (Table  2) followed logically the average found to the series  reported and indicated that O-methylation induced  shifts that are in the same direction as those reported for  monoﬂ avonoids (Markham, 1978). The biﬂ avonoids were assayed for cytotoxicity  toward mouse lymphoma (L5178) and melanoma  cancer cell line (KB) (Edrada et al., 1996). None of the  compounds were active toward the cell line, however,  they showed weak activity against the Gram-positive  bacteria S. aureus and B. subitilis at the concentrations  of 0.5 and 10 µg/mL (Table 3). The reference antibiotic,  streptomycin sulfate, inhibited the growth of all bacterial  species tested in this study at 5 µg/mL (zone inhibition  = 30-35 mm). Compounds 1-4 also were submitted  to preliminary TLC screening for selecting potential  323 Bioactive ﬂ avone dimers from Ouratea multiﬂ ora (Ochnaceae) Rev. Bras. Farmacogn. Braz J.

The antioxidant activities of  biﬂ avones 1-4 were tested toward DPPH radical (Table  3) (Cardoso et al. 2004). Compound 4 showed moderate  scavenging activity (IC50 18.5 µg/mL) in this test (So;  Lewis, 2002), while 1-3 showed weak scavenging  activity which conﬁ rms the dependence of antioxidant  activity with the number of free aromatic hydroxyl  groups  of tested compounds.
