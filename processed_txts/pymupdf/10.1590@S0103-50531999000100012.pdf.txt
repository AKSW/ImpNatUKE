The C25-quassinoids 20(R)- and 20(S)-simarolide were isolated from Simaba cuneata, Sima- roubaceae. The structures of these two compounds were characterized by spectral data, including 1D and 2D NMR spectra which were also used for the complete assignment of the carbon and hydrogen atom chemical shifts. Keywords: Simaba cuneata, Simaroubaceae, C25-quassinoids Introduction 20(R)-simarolide (1a), a C-25 quassinoid was first iso- lated from Simarouba amara. Its structural elucidation, including absolute stereochemistry has already been de- scribed in the literature1,2. The phytochemical study of a Simaba cuneata specimen has allowed the isolation of (1a) and its C-20 epimer (1b). The characterization of these two quassinoids was based on spectral data analysis, obtained from the diacetylated derivatives 2a and 2b, especially NMR [(1D: 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR-PND and 13C-NMR- DEPT) and (2D: 1H x 1H-COSY, 1H x 1H-NOESY, HMQC and HMBC)]. The NMR data comparison of both com- pounds isolated from Simaba cuneata allowed the localiza- tion of an acetoxyl group at C-11 (1a and 1b, Table 1), and the correct assignment of the chemical shifts of all hydro- gen (δH) and 13-carbon (δC) atoms of both diacetyl deriva- tives (2),  20(R)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2a)  and 20(S)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2b). The presence of a carbonyl group at C-17 led us to discuss the possibility of 1b being the result of a C-20 epimerization (α carbon to the carbonyl group) of the major natural compound 20(R)-simarolide (1a), during the extrac- tion and isolation processes. However, the bioproduction of 20(S)-simarolide still can not be discarded. Results and Discussion The 13C-NMR spectra signals of 2a and 2b (Table 1) corresponding to quaternary carbons [(C)9: two ketone carbonyls, four ester and lactone carbonyls and three Csp3 in C-C bonds], methines [(CH)8: three Csp3 attached to oxygen and five Csp3 involved in C-C bonds], methylenes [(CH2)6: one Csp3 attached to oxygen and five Csp3 in- volved in C-C bonds] and methyls [(CH3)6: four involved in C-C bonds and two attached to Csp2 carbonyl carbon] were identified by the comparative analysis of the hydrogen decoupling spectra (PND = proton noise decoupling) and by the DEPT technique (Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer, θ = 90°: only CH signals; θ = 135°: CH2 signals in opposite phase to CH and CH3; after the removal of these signals from the PND spectra, the quater- nary carbon signals were obtained)3. Based on small chemi- cal shift differences observed between 2a and 2b we suggested that they were diastereomers. Article J. Braz. Chem. Soc., Vol. 10, No. 1, 76-84, 1999. © 1999 Soc. Bras.

The relative stere- ochemistry of 1a was defined on the basis of X-ray analy- sis1,2. This is the first report of the complete NMR carbon and hydrogen assignment of 1a. The 1H-NMR (Table 2) and 1H x 1H-COSY of 2a and 2b revealed small significant differences for the protons H-20 [2a: δH 4.31 (m); 2b: δH 4.30 (m)] and CH2-21 [2a: δH 4.59 (t, J = 7.2 Hz) and 4.30 (m); 2b: δH 4.60 (t, J = 7.6 Hz) and 4.34 (m)], clearly showing different spectral pat- terns (Figure 1 and 2). These differences were confirmed by the comparison (Figure 3 and 4) of the heteronuclear correlation spectra (HMQC)4,5 of 2a and 2b (two epimers at C-20), which revealed the δC CH-20 [2a: δC/ δH 41.50 (CH-20)/4.31 (m, H-20); 2b: δC/ δH 41.58 (CH-20)/4.30 (m, H-20)] and CH2-21 [2a: δC/ δH 70.26 (CH2-21)/4.59 (t, H-21) and 4.30 (m, H-21b); 2b: δC/ δH 70.22 (CH-21)/4.60 (t, H-21a) and 4.34 (m, H-21b)] and have permitted the observation of distinct chemical shifts for H-20 (δH 4.31) in 2a and (δH 4.30) in 2b, and for H-21 (δH 4.30) in 2a and (δH 4.34) in 2b. Therefore, it was possible to deduce that the two acetylated derivatives 2a and 2b differ only in the stereochemistry of the chiral carbon C-20. From HMQC spectra of 2a and 2b it was possible to assign all chemical shifts for both, hydrogen and hydrogenated carbon atoms (Tables 1 and 2), also establishing the δH observed for CH-20 (2a: δH 4.31 (m); 2b: δH 4.30), which is surprising 3 (correct assignment in bracket)  200,55 (214,17) O O MeO H O H H H O H OGlic (200,55)  214,17 204,9 214,3 4  O O HO MeO H O O O O H H H H O O AcO O O O H O RO 16 18 15 12 30 23 22 21 20 19 29 1 O O AcO O O O H O RO 30 29 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 9 14 13 9 11 10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 13 12 11 10 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 1b  R= H 2b  R= Ac 1a  R= H 2a  R= Ac O O AcO RO H O O O O H H H H 1  R= H 2  R= Ac A B C D O O O H Vol. 10, No. 1, 1999 Vieira et al. 77 for a methine hydrogen occupying the α position in relation to the carbonyl group, since the δC [2a: δC 41.50 (CH-20); 2b: δC 41.58 (CH-20)] revealed to be compatible with the parameters expected for δC in these structural conditions3. The unequivocal assignment of the δC of all 2a carbon atoms (Table 1) was assured by the analysis of the hetero- nuclear correlation bidimensional spectrum, HMBC. Therefore, for example, the spin-spin interactions of C-1 (δC 206.60) with the 3H-19 [δH 1.24 (Table 2), 3JCH] and C-17 (δC 211.90) with the H-12ax [δH 1.69 (Table 2), 3JCH] and the 3H-18 [δH 0.98 (Table 2), 3JCH] have allowed the correct assignment of the chemical shifts for C-1 and C-17. Other long range correlations can be found in Table 1. Based on the correct assignment of C-1 (δC 206.60) and C-17 (δC 211.90), it was possible to reassign the chemical shifts for this structure and correct some data from the literature. So, the assignment of the δC of C-1 (δC 214.17) and C-17 (numbered as C-22 in reference 6: δC 200.55) of the quassinoid (3) isolated from Picrasma javanica6 should be corrected to C-1 (δC 200.55) and C-22 = C-17 (δC 214.17), as observed in the quassinoid (4) isolated from Picrasma ailanthoides7, since a solvent (pyridine-d5) effect should not be responsible for such a modification. The comparison of the 13C-NMR chemical shift for 2a and 2b also permitted the correct assignment of the 2b quaternary carbon δC (Table 1). With the unequivocal assignment of the δH for 2a and 2b through analysis of the HMQC spectrum (Tables 1 and 2), the homonuclear correlation 1H x 1H-COSY has allowed the recognition of all spin-spin interactions of the hydrogen atoms, especially CH-20, CH2-21 and CH2-22 (Fig. 1). The spectrum of 2a revealed, not only the vicinal interactions, but also the coupling of H-21a [δH 4.59 (t)] in W or M (zig-zag)5 with H-22 [δH 2.75 (m)], which was not observed in the spectrum of 2b (Fig. 1). This comparative analysis allowed the suggestion that the γ-lactone ring in 2a adopts a conformation in which the spin-spin coupling through syn periplanar four bonds with H-21a and H-22 is possible in a W or M geometry (4Jw-H,H), not observed in 2b. The con- formational behavior differences of the γ-lactone ring on both epimers (2a and 2b) can only be justified by a steric interference involving the C-ring and the CH3-18 and CH3- 30 methyl groups. In fact, the most significant differences in the interatomic distances (Table 3), measured at the minimum energy conformation (2a: 102.95 kcal/mol; 2b: 100.49 kcal/mol) using the molecular modeling program - PCMODEL (version 3.0), involve H-20 and 3H-18 hydro- gen atoms (2a: 3.867, 4.230, 5.120 Å, with a mean approxi- mated value = 4.406 Å; 2b: 2.363, 3.583, 3.746 Å, with a mean approximated value = 3.231 Å); ∆Å = 4.406 - 3.231 = 1.175 Å) and 2H-12 hydrogen atoms (2a: 3.804 and 5.000 Å, with a mean approximated value = 4.402 Å; 2b: 1.880 and 3.447 Å, with a mean approximated value = 2.663 Å; ∆Å = 4.402 - 2.663 = 1.739 Å). These data were employed to show, as foreseen, that the epimerization of the CH-20 Table 1. 13C-NMR data (100 MHz) of  2a and 2b, obtained from 1D (PND and DEPT) and 2D spectra (HMBC) registered in CDCl3, chemical shifts in δC in relation to internal reference TMS*. 2a 2b HMBC C δC 2JCH 3JCH δC 1 206.60 3H-19 206.66 8 36.76 3H-10 H-11 36.83 10 49.22 H-9, 3H-19 49.29 13 51.36 3H-18 51.43 16 169.25 H-7, H-14 169.31 17 211.90 H-12ax, 3H-18 211.96 23 174.45 H-22 H-21a 174.50 AcO-2 169.94 2.13 H-2 170.01 AcO-11 171.66 2.04 H-11 171.73 CH 2 72.40 H-3ax 72.46 4 28.61 3H-29 28.69 5 46.61 H-7, 3H- 19, 3H-29 46.66 7 81.57 3H-30 81.63 9 36.09 3H-19, H-7 36.16 11 67.59 H-9, H-12ax 67.41 14 43.50 H-15 H-7, 3H- 18, 3H-30 43.56 20 41.50 H-22 41.58 CH2 3 41.98 H-2 3H-29 42.04 6 26.12 26.21 12 36.33 3H-18 36.44 15 28.56 H-14 28.62 21 70.26 H-20 70.22 22 33.84 2H-21 33.94 CH3 18 24.14 24.34 19 13.01 H-9 13.09 29 18.45 18.51 30 23.34 H-9 23.49 AcO-2 20.58 20.64 AcO-11 21.03 21.09 * The data obtained from HMBC spectra was also used in the assignment of these δC.

Soc. chiral carbon produces diastereoisomers with different en- ergies and interatomic differences between H-20 and the hydrogen atoms bonded to carbons placed close to the chiral center. The 1H x 1H-NOESY dipolar interaction bidimensional spectra of 2a and 2b (Table 4) were used to confirm the trans junctions of the A/B and B/C rings and cis junctions of the B/δ-lactone and C/δ-lactone rings and their corre- sponding conformations. The interpretation difficulties ob- served for the spatial interactions (dipolar-dipolar coupling) due especially to the proximity of H-20 and H-21b absorption positions, involving CH-20, CH-21 and 2H-22 hydrogen atoms were attenuated by the calculation of the interatomic distances (Table 3). Therefore, it was possible to assume the existence of NOE’s between H-20 (δH 4.30) and H-12eq (δH 2.49) and 3H-18 (δH 0.98) of 2b, which were not observed in 2a (Table 3). Furthermore, in the 1H x 1H-NOESY spectrum of 2b, a dipolar interaction was observed between H-11ax (δH 4.92) and H-22 (δH 2.75), indicating spatial proximity of these two hydrogen atoms. As in the spectrum of 2a, the spatial proximity of H-21b (δH 4.30) with H-12eq (δH 2.49), 3H-18 (δH 0.98) and 3H-30 (δH 0.90) could also be assumed. These data were used to postulate the configuration 20(R)-2-O-acetyl- simarolide (2a) for the acetylated derivative of the major natural product (1a) and 20(S)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2b) of the minor natural product (1b). This proposal is in agreement with the specific rotation {2a: [α]D = -14.0° (c 0.8, CHCl3); 2b [α]D = -19.2° (c 1.48, CHCl3)} and with biogenetic considerations, since Simarouba amara1, Pi- crasma javanica6, Picrasma ailanthoides7, are biopro- ducers of C25 quassinoids with 20(R) carbon, and Simaba Table 2. 1H-NMR data (400 MHz) of 1 (1a + 1b), 2a and 2b, obtained from spectra registered in CDCl3 and TMS as internal reference.

This biogenetic consideration reinforces the possibility of 1b being a product formed by an epimerization reaction that may have occurred during the extraction and isolation process, but still does not definitely rule out its biogenetic origin. Finally, the mass spectrum of 2a and 2b, obtained by electronic impact at 70 eV, has revealed the peak corre- sponding to the molecular ion (m/z 546, 1%), and the peaks with m/z 486 (29 %) as well as the peaks m/z at 427 (7 %) and 426 (16 %) Daltons (M-AcOH – AcO• and/or M-AcO• - AcOH, and M-AcOH-AcOH respectively). Other peaks classified as being important for the structural information can be found summarized in Scheme 1. The analysis of the mass spectrum can also be useful for investigations involv- ing the study of crude extracts by GC/MS8. Experimental General The melting points were determined in a Microquimica MQRPF-301 digital model equipment with heating plate. The IR spectra were registered on KBr pellets in a Pelkin- Elmer spectrometer. The Bruker ARX-400 model spec- trometer (1H: 400 MHz; 13C: 100 MHz) was used to obtain the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra, using CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as internal reference. The low resolution mass spectra were obtained in a Fisons/Plataform DI/MS 2000 model operating at 70 eV.

The leaves, bark and branches were dried sepa- rately in a stove with a circulation of air at 30 °C and afterwards were milled in a Willey mill. Extraction and isolation of the chemical constituents The branches (680 g) were extracted consecutively with hexane and methanol at room temperature. After distilla- tion of the solvents were obtained, respectively, 2.1 g and 6.4 g of solid residues. The residue obtained from the MeOH extraction (~5.5 g) was submitted to droplet coun- tercurrent chromatography in descendent mode, using CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (5:5:3 v/v) as solvent. The organic phase was mobile and the aqueous phase was stationary. After 56 h of analysis, 259 fractions, 13 mL each, were collected and divided into 8 groups based on the results from analytical TLC. The fraction 3 (789 mg) was submit- ted to chromatography on a silica gel column, under pres- sure, using CHCl3:MeOH (95:5 initial v/v) as eluent, with an eluting gradient till MeOH (100%). 20 fractions, 20 mL each, were obtained. The fractions 3 (420 mg) and 4 (120 mg) have supplied, respectively, the impure quassinoids 1a and 1b. Acetylated derivations The fractions 3 (420 mg) and 4 (120 mg), previously described, were acetylated with acetic anhydride/pyridine (2:1), as usual, during 12 h. The acetylated derivatives 2a (395 mg) and 2b (8 mg) were obtained and purified by re-crystallization in MeOH. 20(R)-2-O-acetylsimarolide (2a). m.p. > 280 °C.
