Introduction Endophytic fungi are inhabitants of healthy plants that do not cause apparent disease symptoms and can even be beneﬁcial to their hosts (Stadler and Schulz, 2009). The symbiotic relationship between fungi and plants can have profound effects on the plant ecology,  ﬁtness,  evolution,  shaping  plant  communities  and manifesting strong effects on the community structure and diversity  of  associated  organisms  (Rodriguez  et  al.,  2009). Endophytic microorganisms represent a very particular ecological niche able to produce a huge chemical diversity, as a consequence of their biological and biochemical evolution. Therefore, these microorganisms play an important role in natural product discovery. Several new bioactive natural products have been isolated from endophytes with potential application as drug leads and agrochemicals (Borges et al., 2009; Gallo et al., 2008; Gunatilaka, 2006; Guo et al., 2008). In our ongoing research on natural products from endophytic fungi found in association with Asteraceae species we have found several bioactive extracts (Gallo et al., 2009; Guimara˜es et al., 2008), as well as bioactive and new compounds (Borges and Pupo, 2006; Borges et al., 2011; Gallo et al., 2009, 2010; Guimara˜es et al., 2008, 2010). The crude ethyl acetate extract from the endophytic fungus Guignardia mangiferae has previously shown weak antimi- crobial activity (Guimara˜es et al., 2008). Recent studies of an endophyte G. mangiferae, associated with healthy Ilex cornuta leaves, led the isolation of guignardones A–C (Yuan et al., 2010), meroterpenes closely related to tricycloalternarenes derivatives (Liebermann et al., 1997; Qiao et al., 2007; Yuan et al., 2008). We now report the isolation and structure elucidation of new guignardones and tricycloalternarene derivatives obtained from the Czapek culture broth of G. mangiferae. 2. Results and discussion The molecular formula of 1 was established as C17H22O4 according to MS and NMR data. Our NMR data were in agreement with those previously published by Yuan et al. (2010) for guignardone A, a metabolite from the endophytic fungus G. mangiferae found in association with I. cornuta. The relative stereochemistry of guignardone A (1) was established by single- crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and the absolute conﬁguration was inferred by comparison of calculated and experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) (Yuan et al., 2010). In order to check the absolute stereochemistry for 1 experimental ECD was obtained and two positive Cotton effects at 225 nm and 261 nm and a negative Cotton effect at 294 nm (Supplementary data) were coincident for (4S,6R,9S,10R,14R)-guignardone A, corroborating with data in the literature (Yuan et al., 2010). Guignardone D (2) was established as C17H21ClO4 according to MS and NMR data. The HRESIMS data gave an [M+H]+ ion at m/z 325.1185 and [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 347.1008 calc. for C17H22ClO4 325.1206 and C17H21ClNaO4 347.1026, respectively. 1H NMR and Phytochemistry Letters 5 (2012) 519–523 A R T I C L E  I N F O Article history: Received 1 March 2012 Received in revised form 2 May 2012 Accepted 10 May 2012 Available online 25 May 2012 Keywords: Guignardones Tricycloalternarenes Meroterpenes Endophytic fungi Guignardia mangiferae A B S T R A C T Two new guignardones and one tricycloalternarene derivatives, named guignardone D, E (2–3) and tricycloalternarene F (4), and the known guignardone A (1) were isolated from Guignardia mangiferae, an endophytic fungus from the leaves of Viguiera arenaria (Asteraceae), after fermentation in Czapek medium.

Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytol.2012.05.004 13C NMR data for compound 2 showed similarity for tetracyclic moiety compared to compound 1. The 1H NMR spectrum showed a hydrogen at d 3.51 (d, H-7a) coupled to a hydrogen at d 3.81 (d, H- 7b) with J = 7.7 Hz. The HMQC experiment showed correlation between hydrogens H-7a and H-7b with the carbon at d 70.3 (C-7). The hydrogen at d 2.46 (dd, H-5b) is coupled to the hydrogen at d 2.03 (d, H-5a) with J = 10.5 Hz and also to the hydrogen at d 4.55 (d, H-4) with J = 5.6 Hz. Analyses of the HMQC showed correlation of H-5a and H-5b hydrogens with the carbon at d 43.6 (C-5) and analyses of the HMBC showed that these hydrogens correlate with carbons at d 70.3 (C-7), d 78.0 (C-4), d 81.5 (C-6), d 172.2 (C-3) and d 198.4 (C-1). Furthermore, hydrogen at d 4.55 (H-4) showed a correlation with carbon at d 102.6 (C-2). Based on these data it was possible to establish rings C and D for 2 (see Fig. 1). The structural determination of rings A and B of compound 2 was possible after analyses of the HMQC spectrum, which shows the hydrogens at d 2.42 (br s, H-8b) and d 2.21 (br s, H-8a) attached to a carbon at d 15.3 (C-8) and also HMBC correlations with carbons at d 102.6 (C-2), d 44.1 (C-9) and d 89.1 (C-10), indicating the proximity of the methylene group (CH2-8) to rings A and C. Hydrogens at d 4.97 (br s, H-16a) and d 5.22 (br s, H-16b) showed correlations with the carbon at d 114.6 (C-16), via HMQC. Moreover, H-16a and H-16b showed correlation with the carbon at d 43.9 (C-14) and the methylenic carbon at d 47.3 (C-17), a carbon proposed to be attached to a chlorine atom based on the isotope pattern observed in the HRESIMS (Supplementary data) and the deshielded carbon chemical. These data allowed us to establish the side chain attached to the carbon 14 of compound 2 with an addition methylenic and chlorine atom instead of the methyl group found in guignardone A (1). Guignardone E (3) showed similar 1H NMR and 13C NMR data compared to the tetracyclic moiety (rings A–D) of guignardones A (1) and D (2). The main difference observed were the signals of the side chain attached to the carbon C-14. Guignardone E (3) was established as C22H29ClO4 according to MS and NMR data. The HRESIMS data gave an [M+H]+ ion at m/z 393.1805 calc. for C22H30ClO4 393.1832. Analyses of HMQC data showed hydrogens at d 4.95 (br s, H-21b) and d 4.87 (br s, H-21a) attached with the carbon at d 114.2 (C-21) and these hydrogens also correlate via HMBC with a methyl carbon at d 16.8 (C-22) and a methynic carbon at d 65.7 (C-19). Methyl hydrogens at d 1.75 (s, H- 22) showed HMBC correlation with the quaternary carbon at d 143.7 (C-20) and with carbons at d 114.2 (C-21) and d 65.7 (C-19). Attachment of the vinylic hydrogen at d 5.20 (br t, H-17) with the carbon at d 123.5 (C-17) was evident in the HMQC spectrum. The hydrogen at d 5.20 (br t, H-17) also showed HMBC correlations with carbons at d 17.9 (C-16) and d 41.3 (C-14). HMQC analyses showed that hydrogens at d 1.63 (s, H-16) are attached to the carbon at d 17.9 (C-16) and HMBC analysis showed that this hydrogen correlates with three different carbons: a quaternary carbon at d 136.5 (C-15), and two methynic carbons at d 41.3 (C-14) and d 123.5 (C-17). On the basis of above data and analysis of the isotope pattern in the mass spectrum, the side chain attached to the ring A at C-14 was proposed to have a chlorine atom at C-19 (d 65.7). The molecular  formula of tricycloalternarene F (4) was established as C17H24O4 according to MS and NMR data. The HRESIMS data gave an [M+H]+ ion at m/z 293.1747; [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 315.1566 and [M+K]+ ion at m/z 331.1311 calc. for C17H25O4 293.1752, C17H24NaO4 315.1572 and C17H24KO4 331.1311, respec- tively. 1H NMR and 13C NMR data for compound 4 showed similarity for both tricyclic moiety (rings A–C) and side chain attached to the C-14 compared with compound 1. The main differences in the 1H NMR spectrum were the signals at d 3.48 (s, H- 7), d 4.25 (br t, H-4) which were not observed for guignardone A (1), and the signals at d 2.25 (m, H-5a) and d 2.36 (m, H-5b) that showed different multiplicity when compared to 1. Analyses of the HMQC spectrum showed that hydrogens at d 3.48 (H-7) correlates with a carbon at d 58.2 (C-7), characterizing a methoxyl group in compound 4. The absence of the hydrogens and carbon signals for the group CH2-7 in 4 compared to 1 suggests that 4 does not have the tetrahydrofuran ring (ring D). The methoxyl group was attached to carbon C-6 through HMBC analyses that showed methoxyl hydrogens H-7 correlated with the carbon at d 79.1 (C-6), and H-6 is correlated to the carbons at d 65.6 (C-4) and d 194.7 (C- 1). Key HMBC correlations for the establishment of compounds 2–4 are depicted in Fig. 2. NOESY data for compounds 2–4 were not conclusive to establish the relative conﬁgurations. The lack of NOESY informa- tion could be explained by the few amounts isolated of compounds 2–4. Therefore, we were not able to compare experimental versus calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) data for these compounds as carried out for compound 1. We assume that compounds 2–4 share the same relative conﬁguration determined for 1 based on the proposed cyclization pathway to form the tetracyclic system proposed by Yuan et al. (2010) and the similar optical rotation values for compounds 1 and 2. As a part of our search for anticancer and antimicrobial hits, the major metabolite (1) was tested in cytotoxic, enzymatic, antipara- sitic and antibacterial assays. Guignardone A (1) did not show signiﬁcant activities either against MDA-MD-435 (melanoma), HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma) and SF295 (brain) tumor cell lines or in vitro against Leishmania major, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No inhibitory activity of the enzymes Fig. 1. Guignardone A, D and E (1–3) and tricycloalternarene F (4). Fig. 2. Key HMBC correlations for compounds 2–4. D.O. Guimara˜es et al. / Phytochemistry Letters 5 (2012) 519–523 520 adenosil-phosphoribosyl-transferase (APRT) from Leishmania tar- entolae and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Trypanossoma cruzi was also observed. There are few examples of tricycloalternarenes (TCAs) and bicycloalternarenes (BCAs) in the literature and these com- pounds have been isolated from the phytopathogenic fungus Alternaria alternate (Liebermann et al., 1997, 2000; Nussbaum et al., 1999; Qiao et al., 2007; Yuan et al., 2008). These compounds are closely related to the minor Alternaria citri tangerine-toxins (ACTG-toxins) which damage leaves of sensitive varieties of Citrus reticulate (Nussbaum et al., 1999). However, their exact biological function has not been clariﬁed and together with other compounds they may serve as nonspeciﬁc phytotox- ins (Qiao et al., 2007). Known TCAs derivatives have been reported to act as non-speciﬁc toxins and show positive results in leaf-puncture assays by causing spreading brown lesions and necrotic effects (Liebermann et al., 1997, 2000; Nussbaum et al., 1999). Moreover, TCA 2b, a compound previously described, showed cytotoxic activity against A-549 and HL-60 with 88.6% and 98.7% inhibition, respectively, when tested at 16 mg/mL (Yuan et al., 2008). Biosynthetic feeding experiments of bicycloalternarenes, inter- mediates of tricycloalternarenes, indicate that these compounds are mixed terpenoids (Liebermann et al., 2001). The terpenoid moiety is characterized by the combination of three isoprene units biosynthesized via mevalonate pathway and the nonterpenoid part, a six membered cyclic a,b-unsaturated ketone, derivated from the shikimate pathway (Liebermann et al., 2001). The structural elucidation of guignardones derivatives was recently published by Yuan et al. (2010) and they are very similar to tricycloalternarenes compounds, except for the presence of the tetrahydrofuran ring, which originates a tetracyclic moiety instead of a tricyclic one. More recently, two tricycloalternarenes related to compound 4 and one diastereomer of 1 were also isolated from the endophytic fungus Pycnoporus sanguineus and named coibanoles; however neither ECD was not applied to determine the absolute conﬁguration of the last compound nor complete NOESY data were reported for the tricycloalternarenes (Molinar et al., 2012). There are also two additional guignardones derivatives described, guignardone B and C (Yuan et al., 2010), and we hereby decided to maintain the guignardone nomination for the tetracyclic compounds and tricycloalternarene nomination for the compound 4 that showed a more compatible ring system compared to tricycloalternarenes derivatives. 3. Experimental 3.1. General experimental procedures Optical rotations were measured with a JASCO DIP-370 spectrometer. UV spectra were obtained in methanol (MeOH) solution using a SHIMADZU PC 1520 spectrophotometer and IR spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer spectrum-RX-IFTIR System. NMR experiments were recorded on BRUKER DRX-500 spectrometer with CDCl3 as solvent. High-resolution ESI-MS data were obtained on an UltrO-TOF (Bruker-daltonics, Billarica, USA). Column chromatographies were carried out on silica gel 60 (Merck, 0.063–0.200 mm) and TLC chromatographies on silica gel/TLC- cards (DC-Alufolien – Kieselgel – Fluka). 3.2. Microorganism Endophytic fungus strain code VA15 was isolated from Viguiera arenaria and identiﬁed as G. mangiferae on the basis of its ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence (Guimara˜es et al., 2008). The strain has been maintained on potato dextrose agar slants, on agar plugs in sterile water and on silica-gel (1–4 mm Synth, Brazil), stored at 4 8C, at ‘‘Laborato´rio de Quı´mica de Micro-organismos – FCFRP-USP’’. 3.3. Culturing of microorganism and isolation of compounds The fungus G. mangiferae was cultured using a two-step fermentation process. First, suspension of the mycelium was aseptically inoculated into 1000 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 200 mL of seed medium (Jackson et al., 1993). The ﬂasks were incubated for 48 h at 30 8C on a rotary shaker (New Brunswick Scientiﬁc Co., Inc., model INNOVA TM 4300 – NJ, USA) operating at 120 rpm. The mycelia were aseptically vacuum ﬁltered from the culture broths (discarded) and transferred into 2000 mL Erlen- meyer ﬂasks containing 400 mL of Czapek fermentation medium (Alviano et al., 1992). Eleven ﬂasks were used for G. mangiferae fermentation (4400 mL culture medium). The cultures were incubated  for  additional  20  days  at  30 8C,  120 rpm.  After fermentation the culture broth was separated from the mycelia by vacuum ﬁltration and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and n-butanol (BuOH). The organic solvents were evaporated under vacuum, yielding the organic crude extracts. The BuOH extract (1.64 g) was solubilized in methanol (MeOH) and the MeOH-soluble fraction (789 mg) was subjected to preparative silica gel 60 H column chromatography eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 7:3 (100 mL), n-hexane/EtOAc 1:1 (100 mL), n- hexane/EtOAc 3:7 (100 mL), EtOAc 100% (100 mL) and MeOH 100% (100 mL) yielding 5 fractions. Sub-fraction 3 (30.7 mg), obtained from n-hexane/EtOAc 1:1, was subjected to silica gel 60 column  chromatography  eluted  with  n-hexane/EtOAc  1:1 (150 mL) and MeOH 100% (100 mL) to yield 5 fractions. Sub- fractions 3.2 (8.9 mg) and 3.4 (3.2 mg) yielded compounds 1 and 4, respectively. Sub-fraction 2 (25.4 mg), obtained from n-hexane/EtOAc 1:1, was submitted to silica gel 60 column chromatography eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 7:3 (100 mL), EtOAc (50 mL) and MeOH 100% (100 mL) to yield 6 fractions. Sub-fractions 2.1 (4.2 mg) and 2.2 (3.2 mg) were submitted to preparative TLC in silica gel eluted with n-hexane/EtOAc 1:1. Compound 3 (1.6 mg; Rf = 2.6, n-hexane/ EtOAc 7:3) and compound 2 (0.5 mg; Rf = 3.2, n-hexane/EtOAc 7:3) were isolated from sub-fractions 2.1 and 2.2, respectively. Compound 1 (guignardone A).
