Abstract-A  mixture of secoisolariciresinol  lignans acylated at C-9 and C-9’ with dodecanoic, tetradecanoic  and  hexadecanoic acids, the triterpenes 3-oxo-tirucalla-7,24diene  and 3,21-dioxo-tirucalla-7,2~diene,  and the steroids  sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, sitostenone, sti~astenone  and campestenone  were isolated from the stems of  Simaba cuneuta. Their structures  were established  based on full spectral analysis and chemical methods.  I~RODU~ON  Many species of the genus Samba Aubl. have been shown  to contain quassinoids [l]. An investigation of the stems  of the previously uninvestigated  S. ctlneata St. Hil. (Tull)  which grows in S&o Paulo state, Brazil, has led to the  isolation  of two triterpenes  based on tirucallane,  six  steroids and a mixture of lignans acylated with fatty  acids. GC-mass spectral analysis and interpretation  of  ‘“CNMR  data showed that the fatty acids had non-  branched chains. This appears to be the first record of  fatty acid esters of lignans from the Simaroubaceae  or  from the allied families of the order Rutales [2]. Secoiso-  lariciresinol diesters have also been isolated from Saluia  plebeia (Labia&)  [3].  ciresinol have only been reported from Saivia plebeia  (Labiatae).  The initial fractions of the chromatographic  analysis  yielded large amounts of a solid which was rechromato-  graphed affording two triterpenes  3-oxo-tirucalla-7,24-  diene and 3,21-dioxo-tirucalla_7,24_diene  [7, S] and six  steroids: sitosterol, stigmasterol,  campesterol, sitosten-  one, stigmastenone  and campestenone  [3,4]. The frac-  tion containing hydroxy steroids was acylated with acetic  anhydride in pyridine prior to analysis. The latter fraction  and fraction containing keto steroids were identified by  GC-mass spectrometry and comparison with published  spectral data [S].  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The major compounds investigated in this study were  identitied as a mixture of lignans acylated with long-chain  saturated fatty acids (1) which yielded secoisolariciresinol  (2) [3,4] upon hydrolysis. The acids were esterified with  diazomethane  and identified  as dodecanoate,  tetra-  decanoate and hexadecanoate methyl esters by GC-mass  spectral analysis and compa~son  with publish~  data  I33  2115  The most common tetracyclic triterpenes in Simarou-  baceae are tirucalla-7-ene  derivatives  which arc the  precursors of quassinoids,  compounds  that are major  chemotaxonomic  characters of the family [ 11. However,  this represents the first report of 1,4-diarylbutane-type  lignans from this family. Indeed lignans do not seem to be  common in Simaroubaceae. As the distribution of lignans  is, to date, restricted to the two rutalean families Rutaceae  and Burseraceae, this report would appear to reinforce  that Simaroubaceae  has strong affinities with the other  rutalean families.  The identification  of the acids as nonbranched  fatty  acids was also supported  by the ‘jCNMR  spectrum  (Table 1) which showed a signal at 6 13.9 for a methyl  group indicting  the absence of a y-gauche effect as  occurs on the terminal methyl group in 3-methyl~ntane  [6]. The mass spectra gave significant  fragments for  m/z 43 [C,H,]+  and 57 [C,H9JC as well as successive  loss of m/z 14 [CH,]  requiring  the presence of non-  branched fatty acids.  These observations suggested that this group of natural  products belongs to ihe secoisolariciresinol  series and  that C-9 and C-9’ have been acylated by dodecanoic,  tetradecanoic  and  hexadecanoic  acids.  All  these  compounds  appear  to be novel.

Plant material. Simaba cuneata was collected in Brazil by Josi  R. Pirani (Departamento  de Botinica, Universidade de SHo  Paulo, S.P.). A voucher specimen (SPF 38208) is deposited at the  Herbarium of the Departamento de Botlnica, Universidade de  Sb Paulo, S.P. The stems (734 g) were dried, powdered, and  extracted with hexane for over a week.  Separation and identijcation of compounds. The hexane extract  of the stems (3.679 g) was chromatrographed  over silica gel using  a gradient of hexane_EtOAc as eluent. Crystallization from  hexane of the fr. eluted with hexane-EtOAc (24: 1) yielded 3-0x0-  tirucalla-7,24-diene (410 mg). Continued elution of the column  with hexane-EtOAc (19: 1) yielded, after crystallization, a mix-  ture of the ketone steroids sitostenone,  stigmastenone  and  campestenone (93 mg), the triterpene 3,21-dioxo-tirucalla-7,24-  diene (48 mg), and the 3-hydroxy-steroids sitosterol, stigmasterol  and  campesterol  (121 mg). Prep.  TLC  (hexaneXH,CI,-  Me&O,  3:16:1) of the fr. eluted with hexane-EtOAc  (17:l)  yielded the lignans diesters (28 mg) as a single spot on TLC using  several different eluents.
