Abstract-Trunk  wood of Licaria rigida contains the neolignans eusiderin, eusiderin-B, canellin-A and caneilin-C.  Trunk  wood of Licariu  rigida Kosterm.  (Lauraceae),  collected at the Ducke Forest Reserve, near Manaus,  Amazonas  State,  contains  besides  sitosterol,  the  neolignans  (for nomenclature  see [2]) eusiderin  (la),  eusiderin8  (lb), canellin-A  (2a) and canellin-C  (2b).  Eusiderin-B has not yet been found in any other plant,  while la is known to occur in species of the genera Aniba,  Eusideroxylon,  Licaria  (Lauraceae)  [2] and  Mrola  (Myristicaceae) [3]. The canellins were isolated originally  from another Licaria species  [4].  The  structural  relationship  between  la  [C,sH1402(OMe)41  and  lb  [C1,HrJ-  0, . OMe . O&H,]  was easily established by ‘H and  C  NMR (Table 1) as well as mass spectral comparisons. A  report on the sole question which is not trivial, namely the  choice between the natural benzodioxane types 1 and the  unnatural  analogue 3, has appeared previously [5].  Manaus, 43576. A trunk wood sample, reduced to powder  (8.5 kg), was percolated with C,H, at room temp. A powdery  mixture of extract (1OOg) and Si gel (150g) was washed  successively with C,H, and CHCI,. Evaporation of the C,H,  soln gave a product (16g) which was chromatographed on Si gel  (500g). Elution was performed initially with C,H, and then with  solvent mixtures of gradually increasing polarity. Evaporation of  the eluates (150ml each) gave 344 fractions. Fractions l-12 were  composed of aliphatic material. Fractions 13-33 were purified by  re-chromatography  and crystallization from petrol to give lb  (1.5 g). TLC (Si gel) of fractions 3472 gave a mixture of lb and  sitosterol  (0.1 g). Fractions  73-110 were purified by re-  chromatography  and crystallization  from MeOH to yield  sitosterol(2.5 g). TLC (Si gel) of fractions 11 l-192 gave la (0.4 g).  No pure compounds  were isolated  from later fractions.  Evaporation of the CHCl, soln gave a product (34 g) which was  chromatographed on Si gel (330g). Elution. initially with CHCl,  EXPERIMENTAL  lsolation of’ constituents. A specimen  of L. rigida from the  Ducke Forest Reserve, near Manaus, AM, was identified by Prof.  K. Kubitzki, Hamburg University.
