The sterol composition of three Palythoa species has been analysed and compared with  literature data.  2. The mixture of sterols known as "palysterol" has been observed in all our samples suggesting that  palysterol might be considered as a fingerprint of Palythoa species.  3. The sterols of Palythoa caribaeorum did not show marked geographic, seasonal or sex variations  and its zooxanthella showed about the same sterol composition as the host symbiont association.  4. Biological implications are discussed.  INTRODUCTION  Chemical studies of zoanthids have dealt principally  with palytoxin (Moore & Bartolini, 1981), zoanthox-  anthins (Prota, 1980; Chevolot, 1981) and myco-  sporins (Hirata et al., 1979). In comparison, very little  attention has been payed to zoanthid sterols (Goad,  1978).  Pioneer in zoanthid sterol chemistry, Bergmann  (1949)  isolated  "palysterol"  from  the  caribbean  Palythoa mammilosa. Based on molecular rotation  studies, palysterol has been first believed to be the  C-20 epimer of 7-sitosterol (I) (Bergmann et al., 1951),  than to be a new sterol of unknown structure (Berg-  mann, 1962). Later Gupta & Scheuer (1969) isolated  the sterol fraction of P. tuberculosa from Eniwetok  and showed it to be identical to Bergmann's paly-  sterol. Analytical gas chromatography (GLC) proved  the presence of five sterols which were separated by  preparative GLC and identified as cholesterol (II),  brassicasterol (III), 22,23-dihydrobrassicasterol (IV),  fl-sitosterol (V) and gorgosterol (VI). From an un-  identified Palythoa collected near Okinawa island,  Kanazawa et al. (1977) also isolated sterols II, III, 1V  and VI co-occurring with chalinasterol (VII), small  amounts of cholesta-5,22(E)-dien-3fl-ol (VIII) and  traces of the very peculiar 23,24~-dimethylcholesta-  5,22-dien-3fl-ol (IX). With this exception, the latter  sterol is found only in octocorals (Kanazawa et al.,  1977; Kelecom et al., 1980) and is supposed to be an  intermediate in the biosynthesis of gorgosterol (VI)  (Ling et al., 1970). Contrasting with the aforemen-  tioned results, another unidentified Palythoa from  Tahiti furnished only chalinasterol (VII) (Gupta &  Scheuer, 1969).  * Part X of the series: Studies of Brazilian Marine Inver-  tebrates.  As a part of our general screening on marine inver-  tebrates from the Brazilian coast, we became inter-  ested in zoanthid sterols. In the two previous papers  of this series (Kelecom, 1981; Kelecom & Sol6-Cava,  1981), we studied the sterol composition of two spe-  cies from the Zoanthus genus. We now report on the  sterol composition of some Brazilian Palythoa species.  In one case, the sterols of the associated alga have  also been analysed.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Equipment  In addition to the equipment described previously (Kele-  com, 1981), we used for centrifugation of the associated  zooxanthellae a Heraeus-Christ Minifuge 2 instrument  operating at 15°C.  Animals  Three Palythoa species were collected on rocky bottom,  along the Brazilian coast. Palythoa caribaeorum were  obtained from various locations, at different periods of the  year and also as sterile, male, female and hermaphrodite  colonies. For convenience, samples have been distinguished  by their collection number. Animals were then sun-dried or  stored over 70"/o aqueous ethanol until examination. Data  about the collection appear in Table l. The associated alga  have been obtained keeping the freshly collected Palythoa  caribaeorum (sample CF-72) for 3 days at 45-5WC. An  abundant mucus is produced which revealed, under micro-  scopic examination, to be extremely rich in intact zooxan-  thellae. The mucus suspended in saline water has been fil-  tered over a 100/~m sieve. Repetitive suspension of the  filtrate in saline water followed by centrifugation yielded a  zooxanthella fraction practically not contaminated by  zoanthid cellular detritus. The host was freeze-dried before  extraction.  677  678  ALPHONSE KELECOM and ANTONIO M. SOLI~-CAVA  Side chain  H o ~ H   "H  II  VIII  f  0  III  VI  IX  .'I  Vll  J  Fig. 1.  Table 1.

Comparative study of zoanthid sterols  679  Extraction  Animals stored over 70% ethanol were extracted as de-  scribed earlier (Kelecom, 1981). Dried animals were  exhaustively extracted with methylene chloride. The yield  in methylene chloride solubles appear in Table 1.  Obtention of the sterols  Obtention of the sterol mixtures and isolation of the  sterols as their steryl acetates by argentic silica gel column  chromatography have been carried out by previously de-  scribed techniques (Kelecom, 1981; Kelecom & Sol&Cava,  1981). As crystallizations of the sterol mixtures altered the  relative proportions of the sterols, sterol mixtures for GLC  comparative analysis have been crystallized only once.

Identical physico chemical data have been recorded for  the other sterol mixtures and will not be repeated here.  From P. caribaeorum sample CF-72, we obtained by  argentic silica gel column chromatography sterols III, VII,  VIII and X as the acetates, all of them over 90~o pure by  GLC. Physico chemical data have been found essentially  identical to reported data (Sheikh & Djerassi,  1974).  Sterols II, IV and VI were obtained no better than 75%  pure.  RESULTS  Biological identification of our collection appeared  to be a delicate task. First, there is no available sys-  tematic biological study  of Brazilian  zoanthids.  Second, the sole strictly South American zoanthid,  Palythoa braziliensis Heider, 1895, had his holotype  lost (Pax & Miiller, 1957, p. 22) and could not be  identified as none of our specimens due to the incom-  plete original description. Finally, systematics of  zoanthids is rather confused at species level (Walsh,  1967). Based on gorgonian (Bayer, 1961) and porifera  distributions (Sol6-Cava et al.,  1981), it can be  assumed that the lower invertebrate marine fauna of  the Brazilian tropical region can be best compared  with the West Indies one. Consequently, final identifi-  cations of our specimens came from their comparison  with zoanthids reported for the West Indies.  Sterol mixtures obtained from male or sterile colo-  nies of Palythoa caribaeorum (except CF-72) have  been found by m.p., [~], MS and GLC practically  identical to each other and also to the sterol mixture  known as palysterol (Bergmann et al., 1951 ; Gupta &  Scheuer, 1969) (see Table 2). The only differences were  the absence of the trace sterol fl-sitosterol (V) (no  molecular ion at m/e = 414) and the presence in some  of our samples of minute amounts of sterols with rela-  tive retention times (RRT) to cholesterol of 0.70 and  1.97.  The sterols of RRT of 1.00~1.13 and 2.09 have been  identified by  co-chromatography  with  authentic  samples of cholesterol (II), brassicasterol (III) and gor-  gosterol (VI). Sterol of RRT 1.27 (molecular ion at  m/e -- 400) has been identified as 22,23-dihydrobrassi-  casterol (IV) on the basis of its RRT identical with  literature data obtained in the same operating con-  ditions (Popov et al., 1976) and by analogy with  reported data for palysterol (Gupta & Scheuer, 1969).  The sterols of RRT 1,50 and 1.97 could not be ident-  ified, by our techniques, due to their too low concen-  trations in the total sterol mixture.  Female or hermaphrodite colonies of P. cari-  baeorum (sample A-001) showed slightly higher con-  centration of gorgosterol (VI) than observed for male  colonies, which may reflect some sex or geographic  Table 2.

SOLI~-CAVA  variations; however for all P. caribaeorum samples  but CF-72, no important sex, geographic or seasonal  variations have been detected (see Table 2).  The sterol mixtures isolated from P. caribaeorum  sample CF-72 and from the unidentified Palythoa spe-  cies (sample G-12) have been found quite similar, par-  ticularly in the high concentration of brassicasterol  (III) and the low one of 22,23-dihydrobrassicasterol  (IV). The former animal was poor in symbiotic algae  and the latter had been collected in deeper waters (see  Table 1). The higher concentration in brassicasterol  together with the lower one in derivative IV might  thus reflect either low amounts of associated algae or  reduced photosynthetic activity. Both animals also  yielded lower amounts of extractable organic material  (Table 1). On the contrary, the yield in organic matter  isolated from the zooxanthella of sample CF-72 was  four times that from the host (Table 1). The sterol  mixture obtained from the isolated alga appeared  very similar to that of the host-symbiont association,  but the concentration of gorgosterol is double in the  alga as compared to the host. This will be discussed  further.  Finally, the GLC trace of the sterol mixture from P.  variabilis (A-015) also showed considerable resem-  blance with the one of palysterol from P. tuberculosa  (Gupta & Scheuer, 1969) but with a somewhat higher  concentration in sterol IV and a lower one in sterol  VI.  The sterol fraction of sample CF-72 was the only  one obtained in sufficient amounts to allow examin-  ation of trace sterols. Acetylation of this sterol mix-  ture, in usual conditions, followed by argentic silica  gel column chromatography afforded the steryl acet-  ates of dominant sterols II, III, IV and VI, and, in  addition, the acetyl derivatives of chalinasterol (VII),  cholesta-5,22(E)-dien-3fl-ol  (VIII) and 24-nor-chol-  esta-5,22(E)-dien-3fl-ol (X), identified by their physico-  chemical properties identical to published data  (Sheikh & Djerassi, 1974). Sterols VII and VIII had  already been reported by Kanazawa et al. (1977) for  an unidentified Palythoa species; sterol X had never  been reported as a zoanthid sterol, however being  found in many marine organisms (Goad, 1978).  DISCUSSION  As it has been observed for the genus Zoanthus  (Kelecom & Sol6-Cava, 1981) and for Antozoans in  general (Kanazawa et al., 1977), Cz8-sterols are also  the major sterols of the genus Palythoa. However,  contrasting with the results obtained for Zoanthus  species, the sterol composition of Palythoa species  appeared much more uniform. Considering the  dominant sterols, one may conclude that Palythoa  variabilis and Palythoa caribaeorum (except sample  CF-72 commented separately) elaborate a mixture of  sterols practically identical to that of P. tuberculosa  reported by Gupta & Scheuer (1969). All along this  discussion, we shall use the name palysterol for this  sterol mixture.  Palysterol has also been reported for the Jamaican  P. marnmilosa (Silberberg, cited by Ciereszko &  Karns, 1973, p. 189) and for the Pacific zoanthids P.  psammophilia and P. vestitus (Quinn et al., 1974). Re-  markably, the latter species was formerly known as  Zoanthus vestitus (Verrill, 1928) and has been recently  reclassified as Palythoa vestitus on the basis of bio-  logical considerations (Walsh & Bowers,  1971).  Hence, albeit a small number of zoanthid species have  been investigated up to now, all colonies of the genus  Palythoa seem to produce the same sterol mixture (at  least for what concerns the major sterols). In addition,  the specimens of P. caribaeorum did not show marked  sex, seasonal or geographic variations. Similarly, no  geographic variations had been observed by Gupta &  Scheuer (1969) for the sterol mixture of P. tuberculosa.  It is thus tempting to consider palysterol as a finger-  print for zoanthids of the genus Palythoa. Indeed,  from the more than 80 marine invertebrates screened  in our laboratory (among them sea stars, holothur-  ians, sponges and gorgonians), only the sterol mix-  tures obtained from animals of the Palythoa genus  presented the GLC trace of palysterol. On the con-  trary, no species of the closely related genus Zoanthus  contained palysterol, since gorgosterol has never been  found in this genus (Kelecom & Sol6-Cava, 1981).  However, an unidentified Tahitian Palythoa species  (Gupta & Scheuer, 1969) and the Hawaiian P. toxica  (Quinn et al., 1974) have been reported to contain  essentially a single sterol, chalinasterol (VII). This is  in apparent contradiction with our assumption that  palysterol might be a fingerprint of the genus  Palythoa. As there seem to be no doubt about the  biological identifications of both specimens, these ob-  servations may be in agreement with the suspicion  that the genus Palythoa might well be comprised of  two different genera or sub-genera (Quinn et al.,  1974). The question raises then whether the presence  of palysterol can be used to divide the genus Palythoa  into two groups, in the same way as the presence ot  cholesterol characterises the division of red algae into  the sub-classes Bangiophycidae and Florideophycidae  (Brothers & Dickson, 1980). Since palysterol did not  show sex, seasonal or geographic dependence and  since palysterol is neither related to the liberae (i.e.  digitated) vs immersae (i.e. incrusted) shape of the col-  ony nor to the presence of palytoxin, known to be  associated with female colonies (Kimura et al., 1972;  Kelecom et al., 1982) (Table 3), it seems that the pres-  ence of palysterol might well be suitable to distinguish  both genera or sub-genera comprised into Palythoa.  Since many marine invertebrates are known to be  unable to biosynthetise sterols de novo (Goad, 1978),  the problem merges to know whether zoanthid sterols  are from exogenous origin or not. Indeed, zoanthids  contain large amounts of intracellular dinoflagellate  algae named zooxanthellae. The role of these algae is  still not well understood, but it is known that zooxan-  thellae furnish nutritive organic material to the host  (Muscatine, 1973). It is thus reasonable to question  about the algal origin of palysterol. But if palysterol  was strictly from algal origin, one should expect the  various palysterol producing Palythoa species to be  associated to identical or very similar zooxanthellae.  This seems not to be the fact since two samples of P.  rnammilosa collected from two locations around  Bermudas have been shown to be associated with two  different strains of zooxanthellae (isoenzyme studies)  and that the similarity coefficient between both  strains was very low (Schoenberg & Trench, 1980).  The same observations have been made with two  Comparative study of zoanthid sterols  Table 3.

Are zoanthid sterols thus strictly produced by the  host, or are they from mixed (host algal) origin'? The  following considerations on gorgosterol may answer  this question.  As pointed out before, gorgosterol is in P. cari-  baeorum (sample CF-72) twice as abundant in the  sterol mixture isolated from the alga as compared  with that from the host. The same observation had  already been reported by Ciereszko et al. (1968) for  gorgosterol from gorgonians. These authors con-  cluded that the occurrence of gorgosterol in coelenter-  ates is associated with the occurrence of zooxanthel-  lae, and it has been shown since then that zooxanthel-  lae-free gorgonians did not contain gorgosterol at all  (Kokke et al., 1981). Recently, gorgosterol has been  isolated from the cultured non-zooxanthella dinofla-  gellate Peridiniumfoliaceum (Withers et al., 1979), but  it has never been found in a cultured zooxanthella  isolated from an host known to contain gorgosterol,  since cultured  zooxanthellae  produce  principally  4~-methyl-sterols (Kokke et al., 1981). This might  indicate that zooxanthellae are unable to produce  gorgosterol or that a modification of the algal metab-  olism takes place when the zooxanthella is isolated  from the host. More probably it means that gorgo-  sterol is effectively produced by the host from an algal  precursor.  A  candidate  for  precursor  might be  4~-methyl-5~-gorgostanol (XI), a sterol which has  been isolated from the cultured marine alga Peridin-  ium foliaceum (Withers et al., 1979). Hence, gorgo-  sterol should be from mixed (host-algal) origin. The  same may be proposed for palysterol which contains  gorgosterol as the second major sterol, but in the  absence of any biosynthetic experiments envolving  zoanthids, no final hypothesis can be proposed.  Further experiments are needed to solve the prob-  lem of the origin of palysterol in zoanthids; but it  remains that palysterol is only produced by most of  the zoanthids of the genus Palythoa and that paly-  sterol might be useful to divide the genus Palythoa  into two genera or sub-genera.
