Introduction The triterpenoid quinonemethides (celastroloids) consti- tute a relatively small group of unsaturated and oxygen- ated D:A-friedo-nor-oleananes with interesting structures and a variety of biological activities.1–3 A number of biscelastroloids have been recently encoun- tered in plants of the family Celastraceae.4 These are composed of quinonemethide and aromatic forms of nor-triterpenes derived from pristimerin (4a), tingenone (4b), and 22-hydroxytingenone (4c) and/or their congen- ers, joined by two ether linkages formed between the A rings of the two celastroloids, or between the A and the B rings; only exceptions being Rzedowskia bistriterpe- noids I (5a) and II (5b)5 which contain a single ether linkage between the two subunits.4a Surprisingly, to date, there are no reported syntheses of biscelastroloids in which the two celastroloid moieties are joined by two ether linkages. In continuing our studies on reactions of celastroloids,6 we have explored the potential of DDQ- mediated oxidative coupling of triterpenoid quinon- emethides for biomimetic-type syntheses of biscelastro- loids, and herein we report that the reaction of pristimerin with DDQ yields xuxuarines Ea (1) and Eb (2). An unusual product obtained from this reaction was identiﬁed as pristimerin dicyanophenalenedione (3), formed probably by Diels-Alder-type addition of DDQ to pristimerin followed by retro-Diels-Alder-type elimination. Close resemblance of the spectral data of 1 and 2 with those reported for Rzedowskia bistriterpe- noids I (5a) and II (5b) together with some discrepancies in the assignment of their NMR data strongly suggest that the structures proposed by Gonzalez et al.4a for the Rzedowskia bistriterpenoids require revision. 2.

In the low-ﬁeld region, it had signals due to an aromatic proton [d 6.80 (s)] and an oleﬁnic proton [d 6.25 (s)] of a 6-oxo-phenolic type triterpenoid system,7 and protons of a quinonemethide system [d 6.09 (1H, d, J = 1.6 Hz), 6.24 (1H, dd, J = 6.6 and 1.6 Hz), 5.94 (1H, d, J = 6.6 Hz)].3a The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 had signals due to two a,b-unsaturated carbonyls (d 187.89 and 190.22), two ester carbonyls (d 178.73 and 178.82), and fourteen aromatic/oleﬁnic carbons. These data suggested that 1 is a dimeric celastroloid consisting of quinonemethide and 6-oxo-phenolic subunits. The presence of a D2O exchangeable signal at dH 5.11 and a dioxygenated carbon signal at dc 91.98 was indicative of a dimer joined by two ether linkages formed between the A rings of the two monomeric units. Oxidative cou- pling of quinonemethide and 6-oxo-phenolic subunits would give rise to two regioisomers (having C20–O– C3–C4–O–C30 and C20–O–C4–C3–O–C30 ether link- ages) each with two stereoisomers. Analysis of the HMBC spectrum (Table 1) indicated the presence of a weak long-range correlation between CH3-23 and C-30 suggesting C20–O-C3–C4–O–C30 regiochemistry for 1 which was conﬁrmed by the proton chemical shift of CH3-230 (d 2.74),4e,h–j and the NOE between H-6 and CH3-230 in its ROESY spectrum. The CH3-230 signals of its regioisomers (isoxuxuarines) have been reported to occur in the region d 2.48–2.52.4g–i The foregoing sug- gested that 1 has the gross structure identical with xuxu- arine E,4h,j and the positive speciﬁc rotation conﬁrmed its identity as xuxuarine Ea.4j The molecular formula of compound 2 was determined to be C60H78O9. The 1H, and 13C NMR spectroscopic data of 2 were almost identical with those of 1 (Table 1). The [a]D value of 2 (�349.4) was found to be the opposite of that of 1 (+361.7) suggesting that 2 is iden- tical with xuxuarine Eb and this was conﬁrmed by com- parison of 1H and 13C NMR data of 2 with those reported for xuxuarine Eb.4h The regiochemical and ste- reochemical assignments of the dimer interface in com- pounds 1 and 2 were further conﬁrmed on the basis of their 600 MHz ROESY spectra and from molecular modeling. Analyses of COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and ROESY spectra allowed the assignment of all the 1H and 13C signals of 1 and 2 (Table 1), some of which have not been assigned in previous studies.4h,j Compound 3 was obtained as a red powder and its HRFABMS and 13C NMR data suggested the molecu- lar formula C34H36O4N2. Since DDQ is the only nitro- gen containing compound that was present in the reaction mixture, it was suspected to have formed by the addition of DDQ (C8O2Cl2N2) to pristimerin (4a) (C30H40O4) followed by the elimination of C4H4O2Cl2. The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 in the low-ﬁeld region showed the absence of quinonemethide protons with their typical splitting patterns.3a Instead, three 1H sing- lets were present at d 8.19, 6.87, and 6.64. The 1H NMR spectrum also indicated the absence of the signal due to quinonemethide CH3-23 suggesting that it had partici- pated in the reaction with DDQ. The 13C NMR spec- trum showed the presence of signals due to ten aromatic/oleﬁnic carbons, two carbonyls, one ester car- bonyl, and two nitrile carbons. In the HMBC spectrum, the low-ﬁeld 1H singlet at dH 8.19 showed cross peaks with C-3, C-4, C-5, and one of the newly introduced quaternary carbons (C-32) placing this proton at C-23, which is indicative that oxidation of CH3-23 had oc- curred to the level of a sp2-hybridized methine. The additional four carbons and two nitrogens belong to a 1,2-dicyanoethylene moiety bridging C-23 and C-6 to make an aromatic ring, suggesting this product to be pristimerin dicyanophenalenedione (3). Detailed analy- sis of COSY, HMBC, and HSQC correlations (Fig. 1) allowed its structure elucidation and complete assign- ments of 1H and 13C NMR signals of 3.

We have previously demon- strated that the oxidation of pristimerol with N- bromosuccinimide produces 6-oxo-pristimerol (6).7 As depicted in Figure 2, it is possible that 6 could be formed from pristimerin (4a) by the addition of water to its qui- nonemethide system followed by oxidation with DDQ. Coupling of 4a and 6 to produce 1 and 2 with C4–O– C30 linkage may then occur through oxidized pristimerin (7) or oxidized 6-oxo-pristimerol (8). It is noteworthy that the intermediacy of ortho-quinones related to 8 has been implicated in the biosynthesis of xuxuarines,4e scutidins,4f and triscutins.8 However, the formation of 3 during the DDQ oxidation of pristimerin (4a) suggests the possible intermediacy of 7 in the formation of 1 and 2 (Fig. 2). Although rare, Diels-Alder-type reactions between DDQ and dienes similar to that depicted in Fig- ure 3 are known,9 the hitherto unprecedented retro- Diels-Alder-type elimination of a molecule of O@C@(Cl)C–C(Cl)@C@O from the adduct 9 can be ex- plained as due to the thermodynamic stability of the resulting aromatic product 3. We are continuing our studies to elucidate the mechanism of DDQ-mediated biomimetic-type reaction of pristimerin (4a) leading to the formation of 1 and 2. 3. Experimental 3.1.

Chem. 16 (2008) 1884–1889 1887 agents and solvents for chemical reactions were pur- chased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Melting points were determined on a Fisher-John’s melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Optical rotations were measured with a Jasco Dip–370 polarimeter. IR spectra were for KBr disks recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR-8300 spec- trometer. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving each compound (3.7 mg of 1, 4.8 mg of 2, and 3.1 mg of 3) in 0.5 mL of CDCl3 (0.05% TMS) in a 5 mm NMR tube. 1H and 2D NMR spectra were acquired at 25 �C on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer with a 1H frequency of 600.13 MHz, using a Nalorac 5 mm in- verse HCN Z-gradient probe. 13C and DEPT spectra were acquired at 25 �C on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrom- eter using a Bruker 5 mm dual (13C/1H) probe. All NMR data were acquired with over-sampling and digi- tal ﬁltering (decimation factor 32 for 2D, 24 for 1H and 6 for 13C) and processed using the Felix software package (Accelerys, Inc., San Diego, CA).11 All 1D spectra were referenced to TMS at 0 ppm for 1H and CDCl3 at 77.0 ppm for 13C. HRMS were recorded on a JEOL HX110A spectrometer. TLC and prep. TLC were performed on silica gel 60 GF254 plates (Merck), whereas CC was carried out on silica gel type 60 (Baker). 3.2. Reaction of Pristimerin with DDQ DDQ (30.1 mg, 131.3 lmol) was added to a stirred solu- tion of pristimerin (51.2 mg, 109.5 lmol) in freshly dis- tilled dry dioxane (5.0 mL) at 25 �C. Reaction was monitored by TLC. After 6 h, TLC indicated the disap- pearance of pristimerin and its transformation to at least three products. EtOAc (150 mL) was then added to the reaction mixture and the organic phase washed with dis- tilled water (6 · 100 mL), dried (Na2SO4) and evapo- rated under reduced pressure yielding the crude product mixture (68.2 mg). This was adsorbed onto sil- ica gel (200 mg) and chromatographed over a column of silica gel (3.5 g) made up in hexane and eluted with hexane followed by hexane containing increasing amounts of EtOAc. 10 mL fractions were collected. Fractions (13–15) eluted with 10% EtOAc in hexane were combined and puriﬁed on prep. TLC (eluant: 40% EtOAc) to give 1 (3.7 mg). Fractions (16 and 17) eluted with the same solvent were combined and puriﬁed on prep. TLC (eluant: 40% EtOAc in hexane) to give 2 (4.8 mg). Middle fractions (20–22) of the column eluted with 20% EtOAc in hexane were combined and puriﬁed on prep. TLC (eluant: 40% EtOAc in hexane) to give 3 (3.1 mg). 3.2.1. Xuxuarine Ea (1).
