The vast knowledge accumulated in recent years about in- ﬂammatory diseases has permitted a better understanding of the mechanism of action of the several mediators. In this context, some enzymes such as cyclooxygenases, nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) have been widely rec- ognized as powerful targets for the action of anti-inﬂamma- tory agents.1—3) MPO is a leukocyte-derived heme peroxi- dase which has long been considered as a microbial enzyme centrally linked to the unspeciﬁc immune defense system. MPO plays an important role in oxidants production by poly- morphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). It uses hydrogen perox- ide (H2O2) and chloride gas to catalyze the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which contributes to both micro- bial killing, and subsequent oxidative injury of host tissue triggering severe inﬂammatory disorders,4) including rheuma- toid arthritis,5) inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD),6) cystic  ﬁbrosis,7) neonatal lung injury,8) and adult respiratory distress syndrome.9) Thus, the search for new MPO inhibitors from natural sources can provide prototypes for the anti-inﬂamma- tory drug discovery, and design of novel therapeutic strate- gies. Pterogyne nitens TULASNE (Fabaceae) popularly known as “cocal”, “yvira-ró”, “amendoinzeiro”, “bálsamo” is a highly branched and ca. 5—12 m high tree.10) Its wood is used for house building, for furniture and to make bows.11) In folk medicine, stem barks have been used as antiparasitic agent e.g., for treatment of ascariasis.12) As previously reported, the leaves of P. nitens yielded ﬁve guanidine alkaloids, which ex- hibited cytotoxic activity against the DNA-repair-deﬁcient yeast mutant RS 321 and moderate cytotoxicity against to CHO Aux B1 cells.13) Preliminary study on additional bio- logical activities of P. nitens indicated a strong inhibition of rat paw edema suggesting the presence of anti-inﬂammatory compounds in its leaves EtOH extract which prompted us to investigate its chemical composition and evaluate the antioxi- dant and MPO inhibitory properties of the isolates. Experimental Plant Material Leaves of Pterogyne nitens were collected in the Botanic Garden of São Paulo, SP, Brazil, in May 2003, and a voucher speci- men (SP204319) has been deposited in the herbarium of the Botanic Insti- tute (SP, Brazil). Isolation and Puriﬁcation The shade-dried leaves (2.3 kg) of P. nitens were ground and defatted with n-hexane (1.8 l�3, at room temperature) and exhaustively extracted by maceration with ethanol (2.7 l�3) at room temper- ature. The ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 9.2 g of a syrupy residue. The concentrate was then diluted with MeOH : H2O (4 : 1) and successively partitioned with EtOAc and n-butanol. After solvent removal using a rotaevaporator, each partition phase yielded 3.0 and 4.2 g, respectively. The EtOAc residue (1.5 g) was chromatographed by gel permeation over Sephadex LH-20 eluted with methanol to afford eleven fractions (E1—E11). Chromatographic puriﬁcation of fraction E5 (232 mg) by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : AcOH (46 : 53.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; ﬂow rate 10 ml/min] led to the isolation of compounds 1 (84 mg) and 6 (43 mg). Fraction E8 (112 mg) was puriﬁed by RP-HPLC [MeOH : H2O : AcOH (55 : 44.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm; ﬂow rate 13 ml/min], afford- ing compound 3 (22 mg). TLC analysis of fraction E11 indicated it was pure, and led to its identiﬁcation as compound 5 (130 mg). The butanol frac- tion (1.8 g) was dissolved in MeOH and submitted to gel ﬁltration on Sephadex LH-20 eluted with MeOH, affording 14 fractions (B1—B14). After TLC comparison, fractions B4—B6 were combined (333 mg) and pu- riﬁed by RP-HPLC (MeOH : H2O : AcOH (68 : 31.5 : 0.5), UV detection at 274 nm and ﬂow rate 12 ml/min), to yield compounds 2 (66 mg) and 4 (89 mg). Radical Scavenging Activity (RSA) Antioxidant activity of com- pounds 1—6 was determined using DPPH· (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS·� [2,2�-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as- reagents.14,15) Sample solutions of 1—6 and positive controls at various con- centrations (33.3—1.7 mM) in MeOH were individually added to 67.6 mM DPPH in MeOH. The mixture was incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 30 min. Remaining DPPH was determined colorimetrically at 517 nm by comparing with methanol (negative control) in a microplate reader. ABTS·� was pre- pared by reacting 5 ml of ABTS (7 mM) water solution with 88 ml of 140 mM potassium persulphate (ratio 1 : 0.35) and the mixture allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12—16 h before use. Prior to assay, ABTS·� stock solution was diluted with KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (100 mM, pH 7.0 diluted 1 : 10 before use) buffer solution (ratio 1 : 88). ABTS·� solution (1 ml) was added to glass test tubes containing different concentrations of compounds 1—6 and positive controls (0.5—7.0 mg/ml) and mixed for 15 s. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Scavenging capacity was read spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 734 nm. A lower absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated higher free radical May 2008 723 Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory and Radical Scavenging Activities of Flavones from Pterogyne nitens Daniara Cristina FERNANDES,a Luis Octávio REGASINI,a José Carlos Rebuglio VELLOSA,b Patrícia Mendonça PAULETTI,a Ian CASTRO-GAMBOA,a Vanderlan Silva BOLZANI,a Olga Maria Mascarenhas OLIVEIRA,b and Dulce Helena Siqueira SILVA*,a a NuBBE-Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Department of Organic Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, UNESP-São Paulo State University; Araraquara, SP, CP 355, CEP 14801–970, Brazil: and b Department of Biochemistry and Chemical Technology, Institute of Chemistry, UNESP-São Paulo State University; Araraquara, SP, CP 355, CEP 14801–970, Brazil. Received December 22, 2007; accepted February 12, 2008; published online February 18, 2008 Two new ﬂavone glucosides, nitensosides A and B (1, 2), together with four known compounds, sorbifolin (3), sorbifolin 6-O-b-glucopyranoside (4), pedalitin (5), and pedalitin 6-O-b-glucopyranoside (6) were isolated from Pterogyne nitens. Their structures were elucidated from 1D and 2D NMR analysis, as well as by high resolu- tion mass spectrometry. All the isolated ﬂavones were evaluated for their myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitory ac- tivity. The most active compound, pedalitin, exhibited IC50 value of 3.75 nM on MPO. Additionally, the radical- scavenging capacity of ﬂavones 1—6 was evaluated towards ABTS and DPPH radicals and compared to standard compounds quercetin and Trolox®.

Anti-radical abilities against ABTS·� and DPPH· species were expressed by using mean values obtained from triplicates as percentage of radical reduced (% inhibition) calculated from the equation: % inhibition�[1�(Asample/A)�100], where A is test absorbance without sam- ple (only solvent and free radicals) and Asample is test absorbance with com- pounds 1—6 or positive controls. Myeloperoxidase Inhibitory Activity Inhibitory effects of 7-me- thoxyﬂavones 1—6 on MPO were evaluated through guaiacol oxidation in presence of myeloperoxidase (8 nM) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3 mM).16) The reactions were spectrophotometrically followed at 470 nm, calculated from the initial linear rate of reaction using guaiacol (70 mM) as substrate for the peroxidase inhibitory activity, and were compared at different sample con- centrations of compounds 1—6 (0.50—50 nM) and in the their absence. The IC50 values were obtained from the rates calculated on the basis of % inhibi- tion expressed in concentration-response curves. Results and Discussion Nitensoside A (1) was obtained as yellow amorphous pow- der. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3427 (OH), 1656 (a,b-unsaturated C�O), 1606, 1502, 1452 (C�C, aro- matic), and a broad band at 1160 cm�1, indicating the pres- ence of a glucosyl unit (Fig. 1). The UV spectrum displayed two strong absorption bands at 274 nm and 338 nm. These re- sults strongly suggested that compound 1 is a ﬂavonoid gly- coside.17,18) Analysis of the 1H-NMR data (Table 1) revealed characteristic resonances of aromatic and glycosidic protons (including two anomeric protons) and one methoxy group. The signals at d 4.92 (1H, d, J�7.0 Hz, H-1�), d 4.45 (1H, d, J�1.5 Hz, H-1�), d 3.40 (1H, m, H-6a�), d 3.70 (1H, dd, J�10.0, 1.5 Hz, H-6b�), and d 1.04 (1H, d, J�6.0 Hz, H-6�) suggested the presence of one b-glucopyranosyl and one  a-rhamnopyranosyl unit in compound 1, which was con- ﬁrmed after inspection of the 13C-NMR data set (Table 1) and observation of gHMQC correlations of sugar protons to their respective carbon signals, especially those at d 102.4 (C-1�), d 100.6 (C-1�), d 66.6 (C-6�) and d 17.7 (C-6�).  In the aromatic moiety of compound 1, signals at d 7.96  (2H, d, J�8.5 Hz, H-2�, 6�), 6.94 (2H, d, J�8.5 Hz, H-3�, 5�),  6.87 (1H, s, H-8) and 6.81 (1H, s, H-3) suggested that  the aglycone was an apigenin derivative (5,7,4�-trihydroxy- ﬂavone).17,19) The singlet at d 6.87 was assigned to H-8 of the ﬂavone A-ring on the basis of its characteristic 13C-NMR res- onance at d 91.5.17) The position of the methoxy group was assigned at C-7 on the basis of observed gHMBC and NOESY correlations (Fig. 2). The NOESY 1D spectrum showed a strong interaction between the methoxy proton  signal at d 3.90 and H-8 whereas a gHMBC correlation was observed between the signals at d 158.7 (C-7) and d 3.90, which conﬁrmed the position of the methoxy group at C-7. A singlet observed at d 13.0 was assigned to the C-5 hydroxy proton. These observations conﬁrmed the aglycone unit as 5,6,4�-trihydroxy-7-methoxyﬂavone (sorbifolin), which was consistent with the protonated aglycone [sorbifolin�H]� ion at m/z 301 observed in ﬁrst-order LR-ESI-MS (positive mode) of compound 1.

Assignment of the inner sugar res- onances was achieved by using the anomeric proton reso- nance at d 4.92 as a starting point for the interpretation of 1H–1H-COSY and gHMQC datasets. The coupling constant of the anomeric proton (J�7.0 Hz) conﬁrmed the b-linkage of the ﬁrst glucosyl moiety. The downﬁeld shift of C-6� (�5.5 ppm) and upﬁeld shift of C-5� (�1.4 ppm) glucopyra- nosyl moiety resonances, respectively, compared to sorbifolin- 6-O-b-glucopyranoside,19) indicated that the rhamnopyra- nosyl moiety was attached at C-6�. Moreover, the gHMBC correlation between the signals at d 100.6 (C-1�) and d 3.70 (H-6�) conﬁrmed the C-6�–O–C-1� interglycosidic linkage of compound 1. The high resolution ESI mass spectrum of compound 1 showed a deprotonated molecular ion peak [M�H]� at 607.1657 m/z, in agreement with the calculated mass for the molecular formula C28H31O15 (607.1657). Compound 2 was obtained as amorphous yellow powder and its HR-ESI-MS (negative mode) showed a deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 623.1600 (Calcd 623.1657) associated to the molecular formula C28H31O16. The UV and IR spectra of 2 were similar to those of compound 1 suggesting a 6-O- glucosylﬂavone derivative. The IR of 2 showed a broad hy- droxyl band at 3427 cm�1, and an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl absorption at 1656 cm�1, in addition to a C–O stretching band at 1045 cm�1, indicating a glycosidic substance. The UV spectrum of 2 exhibited absorption maxima typical of  a ﬂavone at 270 nm and 349 nm. The 1H- and 13C-NMR  data (Table 1) suggested that compound 2 had the same 7- methoxyﬂavone skeleton as compound 1, except for the pres- ence of a hydroxy group at C-3�. In fact, the major difference between compounds 1 and 2 was the aromatic spin system displayed by the B ring hydrogens, which were resolved as one ABX spin system at d 7.42 (1H, dd, J�8.5, 2.0 Hz,  H-6�), d 7.50 (1H, d, J�2.0 Hz, H-2�), and d 6.88 (1H, d, J�8.5 Hz, H-5�) for compound 2. The 13C-NMR spectrum  of compound 2 presented 28 signals, deduced from distor- tionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) 90°, DEPT 135° and gHMQC experiments as one methyl, one methylene, ﬁfteen methines, one methoxyl and ten quater- nary carbons, including one a,b-unsaturated ketone at d 182.1, which conﬁrmed the ﬂavone core. Similarly as for nitensoside A, the position of methoxy group and sugar units, as well as the interglycosidic linkage were deduced from gHMBC and NOESY 1D experiments. A gHMBC cor- relation of signals at d 158.7 (C-7) and d 3.88 (OMe) in  addition to NOESY interaction of signals at d 3.88 and d 6.79 (H-8) indicated the position of the methoxy group at  C-7. Cross-peaks between signals at d 128.0 (C-6) and d 4.89 (H-1�), and between signals at d 66.5 (C-6�) and d 4.43 (H-1�) led to the establishment of glucosylation at C-6 and the C-6�–O–C-1� interglycosidic linkage in compound 2. Further gHMBC correlations gave additional support to the structure of this new pedalitin glucoside derivative (Fig. 2). Thus based on spectrometric data analysis, the structures  of ﬂavones 1 and 2 were elucidated as sorbifolin 6-O-a- rhamnopyranosyl(1�→6�)-b-glucopyranoside, and pedalitin 6-O-a-rhamnopyranosyl(1�→6�)-b-glucopyranoside, two new naturally occurring compounds named as nitensoside A and B, respectively. In addition, four known 7-methoxyﬂavones were isolated and identiﬁed as sorbifolin (3),20) sorbifolin 6- O-b-glucopyranoside (4),20) pedalitin (5),20) and pedalitin 6- O-b-glucopyranoside (6).13) The antioxidant activity of the isolates was evaluated by measuring free radical scavenging effects using two different assays, the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and the DPPH radical scavenging activity assay.14,15) Pedalitin deriva- tives had better radical scavenging activity than sorbifolin de- rivatives, probably due to presence of the ortho-dihydroxy group (catechol residue on ring B), which is responsible for enhanced free radical stabilization after one hydrogen radical donation for the antioxidant capacity.21,22) Pedalitin deriva- tives 2, 5 and 6 showed higher scavenging activity towards ABTS radical, with IC50 (mM) values of 5.02, 1.36 and 4.07, respectively; and towards DPPH with IC50 values of 11.0, 5.22, and 8.19, respectively, than sorbifolin derivatives 1, 3 and 4 (Table 2), evidencing a major role of the cathecol moi- ety on the B-ring of ﬂavonoids for enhancement of the free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, among pedalitin de- rivatives, increased activities were observed for pedalitin (5) when compared to its glucosides 2 and 6 in both assays, evi- dencing the inﬂuence of the free hydroxy group at C-6, to generate an additional catechol group (on ring A), and there- fore potentiating its free radical scavenging activity. The presence of two catechol moieties on pedalitin provided even higher activity towards ABTS than for the reference com- pound quercetin (IC50 4.12 mM), as observed previously for glucosyl-xanthones.23) Similarly, this trend has also been ob- served for sorbifolin, which showed lower IC50 (5.7 mM to- wards ABTS, and 13.5 mM towards DPPH) than its 6-O-glu- cosyl derivatives 1 and 4, thus conﬁrming the importance of the 5,6-dihydroxy moiety on ring A for enhanced antiradi- calar activity of 7-methoxyﬂavones. Although a broad spectrum of the effects on mam- malian enzyme systems has already been demonstrated for ﬂavonoids,24) few studies have been devoted to the MPO in- hibitory activity of this class of natural polyphenols.25,26) MPO inhibitory activity has been proven to be dependent on the redox status of biological systems and has been evaluated in this study by a reference method with modiﬁcations.16) The results have been summarized in Table 2 and evidence the importance of the cathecol system on rings A and/or B for increased MPO inhibitory activity. Compounds 2, 5 and 6, displaying a 3�,4�-dihydroxy phenolic moiety, exhibited IC50 values of 19.2, 3.8, and 15.8 nM, respectively, indicating a higher MPO inhibitory activity than compounds 1, 3 and 4, which are sorbifolin derivatives, thus presenting a monohy- droxy phenolic B ring. Glucosides 1, 2, 4 and 6 showed slightly lower activities than their free aglycones, suggesting an important role of the free hydroxyl at C-6. Altogether, these results indicate a clear positive correlation between May 2008 725 Fig. 2. Selected gHMBC (Single Arrow) and NOESY (Double Arrow) Correlations for Compounds 1 and 2 MPO inhibitory activity and radical scavenging properties of ﬂavonoids as shown on Table 2, which might be important for treating inﬂammation derived diseases. Conclusion The association of antiradicalar properties and MPO in- hibitory activity observed for ﬂavones 1—6, tested in this study, indicates this might be a rational approach in the search for bioactive natural products. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the isolated ﬂavones might be considered as potential candidates for the development of anti-inﬂammatory agents, since they present antiradicalar properties and inhibit myeloperoxidase, a key enzyme in- volved in inﬂammatory processes.
