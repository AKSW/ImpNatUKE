INTRODUCTION  Iryanthera  grandis Ducke, known as ucu-tiba vermelha,  occurs in the central region of the Amazon, in the Madeira  and Tapajdz basins [Z]. The epithet of the latin name  refers to the size of the fruits, larger than usual for other  Myristicaceae. The present paper discloses the presence in  these fruits, besides triglycerides (I), of seven compounds,  2a, 2d, 3a and 4a, related with the tocotrienol group of  compounds, Sa, a neolignan, 6, a dihydrochalcone, and 7,  grandinolide.  The last named compound  has been de-  scribed in a previous paper [3]. An additional isolate 8,  ethyl oleate, .should be an artifact produced during the  fractionation  of the extract.  RESULTS  Compound 2a was identified with &tocotrienol[4]  by  spectral means (Table l), as well as transformation  into  the monoacetate  (2b) and the hexahydro-derivative  (2c,  Tables 2 and 3). All 13C NMR peaks (Table 3) were  assignable either to the farnesyl moiety (R’) (for data on  model 9 see [5]) or to the benzopyran moiety (for data on  model 2c see [6]). The relative positions  of the sub-  stituents  on the aromatic  ring were confirmed  by  ‘H NMR double resonance experiments and by a nega-  tive Gibbs test [7].  The mass spectrum of 2a (M+ 396, rel. int. 50%)  showed peaks suggesting two series of fragments, one  involving farnesyl (m/z 205,6 %), geranyl (m/z 137,74 %)  and prenyl (m/z 69,100 7”) cations, and the other involving  10 as parent cation. The structural proposal for 3a (M+  790, rel. int. 90%) relied initially on the fact that this  compound  also generated the indicated series of frag-  ments, together with additional ions of putative structures  11 (m/z 410,5 %) and 12 (m/z 191,8 x). Thus compound  *Part  20  in  the  series  “The  Chemistry  of  Brazilian  Myristicaceae”.  For Part  19 see ref. [l].  Taken  from  the  Doctorate  thesis presented by P. C. V. to Universidade  de S&o  Paul0 (1982).  3a was an oxidative dimer of 2a. Indeed the IR spectra of  both substances were very similar, the hydroxyl band of  3a, however, being less intense. As was to be expected, the  latter compound  also gave only a monoacetate  (3b),  besides a dodecahydro-derivative  (3c, Table 2). The  aromatic region of the ‘H NMR spectrum of 3a (Table 1)  showed a singlet (66.69) due to an isolated proton, besides  two doublets (66.53 and 6.37, both J = 3.0 Hz) due to two  meta related protons. The connection of the two units thus  involved the oxygen of the hydroxyl of one monomer and  an aromatic carbon of the other monomer. A priori both  unsubstituted  aromatic carbons of 2a may function as  bridgeheads in 3a. No protective y-effect, however, was  exerted on the relevant aromatic methyl carbon of 3a. The  13C NMR chemical shifts (Table 3) of both aromatic  methyls were closely comparable (6 15.9 and 16.2; cf. also  6 16.0 for 2a). Substitution thus could not occur also at the  ortho-position  of the methyl situated  on the penta-  substituted aromatic ring of 3a.  The mass spectrum of 2d (M+ 426, rel. int. 22 %) again  showed the characteristic series of peaks involving 10 as  parent cation. Although the isoprenoidal  sequence was  restricted to the prenyl (m/z 69, 60%) fragment, the  presence of an isoprenyl side chain, even if in modified  form, seemed certain. Thus compounds  2a and 2d ap-  peared to have identical skeletons. Comparison  of the  MWs of both (396 vs. 426) revealed the existence of two  hydrogens in the former as against two oxygens in the  latter. Indeed, 2d was an a&unsaturated  carboxylic acid  (1R “In,, 1690 cm- ‘) which was transformed  by diazo-  methane into a methyl ester (2e) and by acetic anhydride  into a monoacetate (2f). Catalytic hydrogenation  of this  acetate led to a hexahydro-derivative  (2g, Table 2), in  complete agreement with the presence of an isoprenoidal  side chain. Prominent  mass spectrum fragments of this  compound (M + 474,60 %) were 10 (m/z 177,29 %) and 13  (m/z 144, 50%). The latter, a McLafferty rearrangement  product of 2g, justified the placement of the carboxyl as  shown in 2d. All possible ‘H NMR double irradiation  experiments, as well as spectral comparisons of 2d with 2a  and 14 [S] as model compounds (Table l), consubstan-  tiated the validity of the proposed structure 2d.  2281  2282  P.

Indeed, catalytic hydrogenation  led  (M+ 422, rel. int. 8 %) the aromatic ring was substituted by  to an octahydro-derivative  (4b, Table 2) with only one pair  an isoprenoidal side chain.

Since these  protons were practically equivalent (for both 66.51, s),  they were symmetrically situated also with respect to the  other oxy-function  and the compound  possessed struc-  ture 4a.  The dihydroxy-4-aryltetralin  structure proposed for  compound  5a was shown by the formation of a diacetate  (5b), as well as on mass, ‘H and 13C NMR spectral  comparison  with known representatives  of this series  [lo]. The major mass spectrum fragment (m/z 212,69x)  was formed by the retro Diels-Alder  splitting of the  elements of but-Zene. It had to have the two hydroxyls on  separate rings on account of the conspicuous hydroxy-  tropylium ion (m/z 107, 18%). The localization of one  hydroxyl on the aromatic part of the tetralin system was  ascertained through the existence of a m&z-split doublet  at relatively very high field (66.2, J = 2.0 Hz) in the  ‘H NMR spectrum, which could only belong to a peri-  hydrogen protected by a nearby aryl group [l 11.
