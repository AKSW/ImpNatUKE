Pupo 1  1 Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas de Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, SP,  Brazil  2 Departamento de Fisiologia e Farmacologia, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil  Smallanthus sonchifolius is a traditional Andean plant which has been cultured mainly in Brazil,  Japan and New Zealand due to its medicinal properties. A study of the endophytic fungi  associated to the plant was carried out in order to characterize new cytotoxic agents. Thirty  two fungal strains were isolated and submitted to cultivation and extraction producing   186 extracts. Of these, 12% displayed moderate to high cytotoxic activities and were considered  promising anticancer compound sources. The ethyl acetate fractions of Nigrospora sphaerica and  Phoma betae liquid fermentations contained the synergistic compounds 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3- methylisocoumarin and (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one which are potential com- pounds for drug discovery. Another isolated compound, pimara-7,15-dien-3-β-ol diterpene is  being characterized for the first time through a detailed spectroscopic analysis including  GC/MS, homo- and hetero-nuclear correlated NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, COSY and  NOEdiff) along with its optical rotation.

H. Robinson, a commonly employed Andean-originated  medicinal plant, has antidiabetic and anti-inflamma- tory effects. Some unique substances like the anti-  microbial melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones   [1–3] are present in the plant. Its tuberous roots, rich  in enzymes and fructose derivatives (FOS, GF2-9), but  deficient in starch, are indicated and consumed as  healthy diet foods and prebiotics, specially in South  America, New Zealand and Japan [4–7]. The plant is  also a special and unusual biological niche for fungal  colonization.                                  Correspondence: Dr. Mônica T.

They may have qualitatively different rela- tionships with a single host plant, from parasitism to  mutualism, and/or interact with other fungi inside the  same plant. As mutualists, endophytic fungi are con- sidered innocuous to the host plant. They live in a   reciprocally balanced stable state that disadvantages  none of the partners, including the absence of external  manifestation of diseases in the host [8]. Associated  fungi may produce substances with specific functions  inside and outside the host plant in which they nor- mally reside. Thus, several bioactive natural products  have been isolated from endophytic fungi showing a  range of effects, for instance antimicrobial and anti- cancer [9].    As part of the bioprospecting program in endophytic  fungi associated to therapeutic Asteraceae [10–13], it  was considered that S. sonchifolius, commonly named  Yacon, could host endophytic fungi able to produce  Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151  Production of new cytotoxic agents  143  © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Using this approach,   32 endophytes have been isolated and characterized  yielding several cytotoxic extracts and compounds.  Some of the compounds isolated in this research are  being reported for the first time as secondary metabo- lites produced by the studied fungi. The relevance of  the cytotoxic outcome in the fungi and host plant asso- ciations is discussed.  Materials and methods  Isolation, identification and preservation   of fungal strains  Yacon leaves, roots and stems were collected in Febru- ary 2006, in the city of Ribeirão Preto (S 21°11.933′  NO 47°46.699′), State of São Paulo, Brazil. A voucher  specimen was deposited at the herbarium of the Fac- ulty of Philosophy, Sciences and Humanities of Ribeirão  Preto campus, University of São Paulo (FFCLRP-USP)  Ribeirão Preto, Brazil.    The collected plant material was washed with run- ning tap water and dried with absorbent paper. Surface  sterilization procedures for epiphytic microbes were  carried out by sequentially submerging the plant mate- rial in 70% aqueous ethanol (2.5 min), 2.5% aqueous  sodium hypochlorite (30, 60 or 90 min), 70% aqueous  ethanol (1 min) and sterile distilled water (1 min). The  borders of the sterilized segments were discarded and  four tiny pieces each about 5 mm in length were ex- cised with a sterilized scalpel from the remaining plant  tissue. The excised pieces from each tissue type were  plated on triplicate Petri dishes containing PDA me- dium supplemented with pentabiotic (100 μg/ml) and  incubated initially at 30 °C for 48 h, followed by 72 h at  23 °C. The effectiveness of the sterilization procedure  was verified by plating aliquots of the final water rinse  on the same medium used for the endophyte cultures.  Each grown fungus from plant tissues was repeatedly  subcultured on PDA antibiotic-free medium until pure  cultures were obtained.    Conidia producing strains were identified at the De- partment of Mycology, Center of Biological Sciences   of the Federal University of Pernambuco, PE, Brazil.  Sporulating fungi were stored at 10 °C in tubes contain- ing silica gel (6 to 12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant   activated). The isolates, deposited at the Laboratory of  Industrial Enzymology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical   Sciences of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo  (FCFRP-USP), have been maintained by serial transfers  onto PDA slants at 4 °C.  Cultivation and extraction procedures  Two culture media, Czapek and rice, were selected for  cultivation and screening of biological activities of the  isolated fungi, respectively, in liquid and solid cultures.    Liquid cultures were conducted in two steps (Fig. 1).  First, the silica or slant stored fungi were inoculated  onto PDA-containing medium in Petri dishes and incu- bated at 30 °C for 7 d. After this period, aqueous sus- pensions obtained either with fungal conidia or mycelia  were transferred to 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks containing  200 ml of seed medium [14] and incubated at 30 °C for  48 h in a rotatory shaker (120 rpm). As a second step,  this resulting pre-culture was filtered on a Büchner  filter through gauze or filter paper and the obtained  mycelia was transferred to a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask con- taining 400 ml of Czapek medium [15] and incubated at  the same pre-culture conditions for 20 d. This proce- dure was carried out for a small scale extract produc- tion for bioprospection. Fifteen Erlenmeyer flasks were  used for a large scale extract production, aiming to  isolate secondary metabolites. Fungi in the 20 day cul- tures were killed by addition of 50 ml of methanol  (MeOH), the suspension was vacuum-filtered and the  filtrate fractionated by liquid-liquid partition with   ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The resulting organic layer was  evaporated under reduced pressure to produce the  ethyl acetate fraction of liquid cultures (EaL) and a  residue (RL), which was lyophilized. The mycelial mass  collected from the filter was soaked overnight in EtOH,  followed by filtration and solvent evaporation to pro-      Figure 1.

An Erlen- meyer flask containing seed medium without inoculum  was submitted to the same preculture conditions. The  resulting solid filtrate was transferred to Czapek me- dium and treated in the same way for control purposes.    For the solid culture (Fig. 1) 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks  containing 90 g of parboiled rice in 90 ml distilled wa- ter per flask, previously twice autoclaved at 120 °C for  40 min, were employed. For a small scale preparation,  one flask sufficed, but thirty flasks were needed for  large scale extract preparations. Agar plugs (about  2 × 2 cm) cut from the 7 day-old original cultures on  PDA agar were used for inoculation. One flask, without  inoculum, was kept for control use. After 20 days incu- bation in a BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) device at  30 °C, EtOH was added to each flask and the contents  were allowed to stand overnight at room temperature.  The EtOH was filtered and evaporated under reduced  pressure yielding the ethanol extract (EtS), which was  submitted to the previously described liquid-liquid  partition affording the ethyl acetate fraction (EaS) and  the residual fraction (RS).  Isolation of compounds  EaS fraction (20.2 g) of Nigrospora sphaerica was fraction- ated by chromatography over a XAD-4 column  (22.0 × 4.5 cm) using water, MeOH and EtOAc as eluents       Figure 2.

Fraction M2EaS (9.9 g) was fractionated  over silica gel column (CC, 230–80 mesh, 26.0 × 4.5 cm)  using a gradient from with hexane:EtOAc (95:5) to  MeOH (100%; step B) to provide 22 fractions. Fraction  13 (30.1 mg) was identified as compound 1. Fraction  M1EaS (3.1 g) was crystallized from a heated solution of  MeOH/H2O 9:1 yielding compound 3 (101.0 mg; Fig. 2).  Fraction EEaS (1.64 g) chromatographed over silica gel  (400–200 mesh, 25.5 × 5.0 cm) and eluted with the  same gradient as above mentioned (step C) produced 9  fractions. Fraction 5 (246.6 mg) was rechromatographed  over silica gel (CC, 230–80 mesh, 28.0 × 3.0 cm) and  using a gradient from hexane: EtOAc (95:5) to EtOH  (100%; step D) to yield 9 fractions. Fraction 6 (46.3 mg)  was rechromatographed again on silica gel (CC, 230–  80 mesh, 20.0 × 1.3 cm) using the same gradient elution  (step E) to yield compound 2 (16.9 mg).    N. sphaerica fraction EaL (474.3 mg) was fractionated  over silica gel (CC, 400–200 mesh, 24.0 × 3.5 cm) by  elution with gradient hexane:EtOAc (95:5) to EtOH  (100%) (step F) yielding 7 fractions. Fraction 7 crystal- lized spontaneously to afford compound 3 (98.0 mg).    Fraction EaS (16.5 g) originated from 20 day cultures  of Phoma betae (19 flasks) was chromatographed over  silica gel (400–200 mesh, 11.0 × 12.0 cm) under gra-  dient elution from hexane:EtOAc (9:1) to MeOH (100%;  step G; Fig. 3) to afford 9 fractions.

Compound 2 (14.7 mg) was precipi- tated from fraction 5 (99.7 mg) using CHCl3 (step I).    Fraction EaS (888.2 mg) originated from 32 day   cultures of P. betae (1 flask, fungus sporulation time)  was chromatographed over silica gel (400–200 mesh,  27.0 × 3.0 cm) using gradient elution with hexane:  EtOAc (9:1) to MeOH (100%; step J, Fig. 3) to provide   13 fractions (Pb-1 to 13). Fraction 4 (Pb-4, 21.9 mg) was  submitted to HPLC using an isocratic solvent system  containing hexane:EtOAc (9:1) delivered to the a semi- prep Nucleosil 100–7 column (250 × 10 mm I.D.) at a  flow rate of 1.5 ml min–1, and monitored at 254 nm  detection wavelength at 25 °C (step K). Compound 4  (12.1 mg) was collected at 41 min. The residual fraction  (5.0 mg) collected at 45 min was resubmitted to HPLC  employing a prep C18 Shimadzu column (250 × 20 mm  I.D.) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min–1, using MeOH as elu- ent, and monitored at 254 nm (step L). Compound 5  (0.6 mg) was collected at 28 min. Fraction 13 (Pb-13,  426.8 mg) was chromatographed over sephadex LH-20  column (60.0 × 2.5 cm) using EtOH as eluent (step M) to  afford 7 fractions.

Spectroscopic and chromatographic equipment  1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra  were recorded in deuterated solvents (CDCl3, acetone-d6  or MeOH-d4) on Bruker spectrometers (DRX-400 or DRX- 500), working at 400 or 500 MHz for 1H, and at 100 or  125 MHz for 13C. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as  internal reference. Mass spectra were performed in   a high-resolution eletrospray Micromass Quattro LC   spectrometer (HR/ESI/MS) or in a Shimadzu GC/EI/MS  OP2010 employing an AOC-20i auto-injector and a DBS- MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) column. The high per- formance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system con- sisted of a Shimadzu LC-6AD pump, and a SPD-20A UV- vis detector with a CBM-20A interface. Data acquisition  was carried out on LC Solution software version 1.1.  Tumor cell cultures and cytotoxic bioassay  Human tumor cell lines MDA-MB435 (breast), HCT-8  (colon), SF295 (brain) and HL-60 (promyelocytic leuke- mia) were obtained from National Cancer Institute  (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were cultured in  RPMI1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bo- vine serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and strepto- mycin). Cultures were maintained in a humidified in- cubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cytotoxic  effect was assessed using the MTT-dye reduction assay  for cell viability described by Mosmann [16] according  to an established protocol [17]. Briefly, tumor cells were  placed in 96-well plates at the following densities:  0.7 × 105 (HCT-8), 0.6 × 105 (SF295), 0.3 × 106 (HL-60) and  0.1 × 106 (MDA-MB435) cells/ml. Extracts and fractions  were tested in a single concentration (100 μg/ml) and  pure substances in a range between 0.048 and 25 μg/ml  during 72 h. Control groups received the same amount  of vehicle and doxorubicin (Doxolem®, Zodiac Produtos  Farmacêuticos S/A, Brazil), which was used as a positive  control. Growth inhibition rates were quantified as the  percentage of control absorbance by the reduced dye at  550 nm in accordance with the following equation:  Inhibition rate = [(OD control well – OD treated well)                                        × (OD control well)–1] × 100 .    Each sample was tested in two independent experi- ments performed in triplicates. The results consisted of  the average value for each experimental unit. The IC50  values and their 95% confidence intervals were ob- tained by non linear regression using the GraphPad  Prism program (Intuitive Software for Science, San  Diego, CA). An activity scale was utilized to appraise the  cytotoxic potential of the tested samples: inactive sam- ples (I), samples with low activity (LA, cell growth inhi- bition between 1–50%), moderated activity (MA, cell  growth inhibition between 50–75%), and high activity  (HA, cell growth inhibition between 75–100%).

Hence, it was possible to isolate eleven, six and nine  species from stems, roots and leaves, respectively. A  single species, SS21, displayed a systemic colonization  and five other species occurred simultaneously in two  tissues. Species SS13 was recovered from leaves and  roots, SS36 grew from leaves and stems, while SS42,  SS65 and SS67 were isolated from both stems and roots.  Some strains did not sporulate or grow in the culture  conditions employed. They remain unidentified and  were named sterile mycelia. Isolates that sporulated  were identified by traditional taxonomical methods  based on morphological features as established in   Table 1.    The isolated genera Drechslera, Fusarium, Phoma, Alter- naria, Curvularia, Nigrospora, Glomerella and Aspergilus  have been previously reported as plant pathogens in a  range of hosts [18–20]. They also have proven to be  endophytes in several plant species [21–26] strengthen- ing the argument that disease is an exception in the  plant-microbe interaction, which could be more prop- erly regarded as an unbalanced status in a symbiosis  [27]. Genus Papulaspora is a well-known competitive soil  mold in the culture of mushrooms [28, 29] and it has  just been recently reported as an endophyte in a few  species as Vitex negundo [24], Manilkara bidentata [30],  Taxus chinensis [31], Amomum siamense [32] and Solanum  tuberosum [25]. Preussia, however, is recognized either as  a soil or a coprophilous genus [33, 34] but has never  been mentioned before as an endophyte.  Cytotoxic activity of extracts  From the 32 fungal isolates, 186 extracts were obtained  and tested against three tumor cell lines. EaL fractions  had the most pronounced cytotoxic effects together  with EaS fractions (Table 2), whereas fractions EtM, RL  and RS were practically inactive (data not shown). The  exceptions were RLSS33, RLSS75 and RLSS84, which Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151  Production of new cytotoxic agents  147  © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is noteworthy that only ethyl acetate  fractions from both culture types of P. immersa (SS13),   N. sphaerica (SS67) and A. tenuissima (SS77) produced good  results on all tested cells indicating that production   of bioactive molecules by these fungi does not depend   on the culture medium employed. These observations  emphasize the significance of these species in future  biotechnology studies.  Cytotoxic effects and ecological importance   of isolated compounds  N. sphaerica (SS67) and P. betae (SS84) were chosen for  large scale cultures and isolation of bioactive com- pounds due to the cytotoxicity of their extracts.    Three substances were isolated from the N. sphaerica  EaS fraction (SS67, Fig. 4): compound 1 was identified as  pimara-7,15-dien-3β-ol, compound 2 as ergosterol per- oxide and compound 3 as aphidicolin. Spectral data of  compound 2 were in agreement with literature data  [35], while compound 1, recently detected in a plant  essential oil, was not characterized by the authors [36].  This is the first report of compound 1 obtained from a  fungal source and having its structure completely elu- cidated by 1H and 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, MS and  NOEdiff spectral data. Both compounds 1 and 2 showed  weak cytotoxic activity against the tumor cell lines  tested (Table 3).    Compound 3, isolated from the EaL fraction of   N. sphaerica (SS67) had its structure established as the  diterpene aphidicolin (Fig. 4) on the basis of its NMR  data that are in agreement with reported data [37].  Aphidicolin showed a remarkable cytotoxic activity 148  M. B. C. Gallo et al.  Journal of Basic Microbiology 2009, 49, 142–151  © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Aphidicolin also may damage a  fragile site of the mammalian genome [38, 39]. How- ever, it is a valuable tool to study eukaryotic DNA syn- thesis and cell cycles.    P. betae (SS84) EaL fraction actually showed maximal  efficacy against all the three cancer cell lines and was      Table 3.

In liquid potato- sucrose medium, P. betae is reported to produce an as- sortment of bioactive diterpenes [40, 41], including ap-  hidicolin (3), an specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase.  Hence, the low cytotoxic activity of SS84 EaS fraction  was intriguing (Table 2) and led us to investigate its  chemical composition. For this purpose the fungus was  cultivated for two different time periods: for 20 days  according to the general protocol and for 32 days leading  to sporulation. EaS fraction from 20 day cultures was  subjected to chromatographic procedures and the resul- tant subfractions were monitored by GC/MS and 1H NMR  techniques. Several fatty acids were detected but only  compound 2 was isolated corroborating the initial low  activity. However, the EaS fraction resulting from 32 day  cultures yielded compound 6, which was identified as  dimethyl terephthalate (Fig. 4) [42], and a subfraction  that inhibited 100% the proliferation of tumor cell lines  tested. The subfraction 1H NMR spectrum revealed a  mixture of two substances in a 1:1 ratio, later separated  and identified as (22E,24R)-ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3- one (compound 4) and 8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methyl- isocoumarin (compound 5) in accordance with literature  data (Fig. 4) [43, 44]. When compounds 4 and 5 were  tested alone they showed moderate and weak activities,  respectively (Table 3). The low cytotoxicity of compound  4 against other tumor cell lines had been previously  described [45, 46] but the results in this report suggest  that isocoumarin (compound 5) and ergosteroid (com- pound 4) are acting synergistically. In fact, it has been  reported that an isocoumarin propionic acid derivative  has recently entered clinical trials as an anticancer and  anti-angiogenic agent with the property of potentiating  or improving either the therapeutic effects of some  chemotherapeutic drugs [47, 48] or radiotherapy [49].  Our results suggest that compounds 4 and 5 might be  considered as hits for drug development of a novel anti- cancer combination therapy.    The amounts of pesticides employed in S. sonchifolius  cultivation are relatively small leading some authors to  suggest that sesquiterpene lactones [50] and kaurene  diterpenoids [51] occuring in plant leaves may act as  resistance factors. In fact, the endophytes P. betae and   N. sphaerica and their host have similar biosynthetic path- ways [52, 53], and the fungal cytotoxic compounds may  provide extra protection for the plant (Table 1). N. spha- erica is also known to cause both reduction of spore ger- mination [54] and growth inhibition of some pathogenic  fungi, i.e, Fusarium oxysporum [55, 56], one of the isolated  endophytic species in Yacon roots (Table 1). Therefore,  maintenance of N. sphaerica and P. betae as endophytes  seems to be an ecological benefit to S. sonchifolius.
