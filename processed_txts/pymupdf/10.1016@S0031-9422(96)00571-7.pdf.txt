Copyright © 1997 Elsevier Science  Ltd  INTRODUCTION  Recently, we have described the isolation and identi-  fication of three limonoids, methyl lct,6,8ct,14fl,30fl-  pentahydroxy-3-oxo[3.3.1 ~0,2.1 L4]_tricyclomehac.7_oate;  methyl 1 ~t,2fl,3ct,6,8ct, 14fl-hexahydroxy-[4.2.1 ~0.a0.1 ~.4]_  tricyclomeliac-7-oate and methyl l~-acetoxy-2fl,3~,6,  8~, 14fl-pentahydroxy-[4.2.1 ~0.30.1 l"4]-tricyclomeliac- 7-  oate from the stem of Khaya senegalensis [1]. The last  two compounds represent a novel group of methyl  tricyclomeliac-7-oates.  The isolation of this interesting group of new com-  pounds, combined with our taxonomic interest in the  Meliaceae, stimulated an investigation of the leaves of  K. senegalensis. Two new limonoids (1, 2) have now  been isolated along with the known scopoletin, /3-  quercitrin and rutin [2-4].  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The limonoid 1 showed spectral characteristics  (Tables 1 and 2) close to those of methyl l~t-acetoxy-  2fl,3a,6,8ct- 14fl-pentahydroxy-[4.2.110,30.1 L4]-tricyclo-  meliac-7-oate (3) [1]. The principal change observed  in the ~3C NMR spectrum (Table 2) of compound 1  was the replacement of the resonance for an oxy-  methine by a signal of a ketal (or hemiketal) carbon  (6 104.9). The ~H (Table 1) and ~3C NMR showed the  * Based in part on the Ph.D. thesis presented by L.R.V.O.  to PPGQ-UFSCar.  t Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.  existence of two methoxyl groups (6c 52.6 and 50.4;  3r~ 3.78 s and 3.33 s). The signal for H-3 at di 3.48  showed one-bond correlation (HMQC) with the 13C  signal at ~ 82.4 and was coupled only to the ~H signal  of a hydroxyl group (t5 2.86, D20 exch.). In the same  way, the signal for H-30 was visible as a singlet at 3  3.29 and showed cross peaks with the ~3C signal at  68.8 (~J). Thus, the deshielded resonances observed  here, when compared with compound 3, required the  presence of an acyclic hemiketal involving a tertiary  hydroxyl and methoxyl functions at C-2 or a cyclic  ketal formed by joining C-2 to O-14 and methoxyl  group at C-2. The cyclic nature of the ketal function  was apparent from the significant downfield shifts for  C-14 (1: fi 83.4; 3:6 81.5) and C-15 (1: ~ 35.8; 3:  32.0) in the ~3C NMR spectrum, when compared with  3. The correct one was also decided on the basis of  the J3C NMR spectrum, by means of isotope shifts [5]  observed in the H20/D20 experiment, which did not  show any significant effect at C-2. Compound 1 failed  to give an [M] ÷, in the El-mass spectrum, the largest  fragment observed being m/z 447 for [M - (Me, OMe,  FuCHO, H] ÷. However, its PIDCI mass spectrum  showed ions at m/z 605 [M+CH3] ÷, 591 [M+H] +,  573 [M + CH3- CH3OH] +, 559 [M + H - CH3OH] +,  confirming the ketal function and thus the molecular  formula (C30H38Oi2). This was supported by the  HMBC (Table 3) spectrum which showed correlations  from H-3, H-30 (2j) and -OMe (6 3.33, 3j) to the C-2  signal at 6 104.9. The NOESY (Table 4) experiments  showed correlations of H-3 with H3-28 and H-29b,  and of 3-OH with H-5, requiring H-3 on the or-side  and 3-OH on the fl-side of the molecule.

Moreover, the observed correlation of  2-OMe with H-15fl implied that they were close to  each other in space and suggested that the 2-OMe,  together with the cyclic ketal function, may have  caused a downfield shift for H-15fl (1:6 3.50; 3:6 2.69).  The new natural product was therefore identified as  methyl  1 ~-acetoxy-3fl,6,87-trihydroxy-2~-methoxy-  2fl, 14fl-epoxy-[4.2.1 ~0.30.1 ~.4]_tricyclomeliac_7.oate (1).  The limonoid 2, exhibited similar NMR spectra  (Tables 1 and 2) to methyl l~,6,8~,14fl,30fl-penta-  hydroxy-3-oxo-[3.3.1 ~0.2.1 ~'4]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate (4)  [1], except for the presence of a tertiary acetoxyl (6c  170.2, 22.0; fin 2.02 S). Significant upfield shifts for  C-2 and C-29 in the ~3C NMR spectrum, when com-  pared with 4 and its l~,6-diacetoxy derivative 4a [1],  determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-1. Thus,  the structure of the new limonoid was characterized as  methyl 1 ~-acetoxy-6,8~, 14fl,30fl-tetrahydroxy-3-oxo-  [3.3.11o.2.1 ~'4]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate (2).  In  biogenetic  terms,  a  pinacol  pinacolone  rearrangement of a 2,3,30-trihydroxy-l,29-cyclo-  meliacate precursor may have occurred, resulting in a  2-oxo-tricyclo-[4.2.1 ~0,30.1 ~:]-decane.  Subsequent  reduction or addition of an hydroxyl group at C-14  to ketone and O-2-methylation may have led to the  limonoids 3 and 1, respectively.  EXPERIMENTAL  General.
