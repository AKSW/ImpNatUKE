Abstract-Wood  samples,  infested  by fungi during storage,  were shown to contain,  besides the known  5-methyl-  mellein,  additional  (3R)-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-3,4_dihydroisocoumarins  substituted  by  7-methyl,  5-formyl,  5-  carboxy,  5-hydroxy,  5-methoxy,  6-methoxy-5-methyl  and 6,7-dimethoxy-5-methyl  groups,  as well as 6-formyl-7-  hydroxy-5-methoxy-4-methylphthalide.  Several 2-methylchromanones  were synthesized  in order to show that this  class of compounds  can be distinguished  from 3-methyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarins  by MS.  INTRODUCTION  The compounds  la-lf, Za, 2b and 3a were isolated  from  12 species  belonging  to 7 families  of trees (Table  1).  Several  3-methyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarins  and phthal-  ides [ 11, as well as 5-hydroxy-2-methylchromanone  [23  are typical metabolites  of fungi, and, indeed, microscopic  examination  of wood samples 3,ll  and 12, performed  by  Dr. Ozorio  J. M. Fonseca,  revealed  the presence  of  Aspergillus,  Penirillium,  Fusarium  and  Trickoderma  species. Since in freshly cut samples  of the same species  neither  polyketides,  nor fungi could be detected,  fungal  invasion  must have taken place during the drying  and  storage  period  between  collection  and extraction.  The  sites of storage, thousands  of kilometers  apart for samples  belonging  to different species (Table l), did not affect the  nature of the compounds,  which all belong to the same  biogenetic  group. The introduction  of an oxygen function  at C-5 presumably  through  gradual  oxidative  transfor-  mation  of Me (cf. la) via CHO (lc), CO,H  (ld) to OH  (le1 and OMe (If), though  unexceptional,  is interesting.  Small  amounts  of shikimate-acetate  derived  com-  pounds were found to co-occur  in the extracts of Rkeedia  gardneriana [3]: 1,5_dihydroxyxanthone,  1,7-dihydroxy-  xanthone,  1,6-dihydroxy-5-methoxyxanthone;  Virola  caducifoh  [4] : formononetin,  biochani+A,  virolane,  virolanol;  and Virola uenosa [S]: 3-hydroxy-5-methoxy-  stilbene  and virolanol.  While the remaining  9 extracts  were found to be void of detectable  quantities  of shiki-  * Sponsored  by  MimstCrio  do  Planejamento  (FINEP,  CNPq)  and by Fundaqgo  de Amparo  d Pesguisa  do Estado  de  SZo Paula.  mate-acetate  derived phenolics,  fatty acids (4) and esters  (5) as well as sitosterol  and stigmasterol  (6) and sitoste-  none (7) were isolated in considerable  quantities  from all  12 samples  (Table  1). Since  several  hundred  wood  samples, examined  by us over the same period, were kept  in the same storage facilities, lack of antibiotic  phenolics,  accumulation  of fatty or steroidal  material  or both seem  to justify fungal invasion.  RESULTS  Expansions  of the molecular  formulae, based on PMR  spectra,  reveal the compounds  to be trisubstituted  (la-  If), tetrasubstituted  (2a) and pentasubstituted  (2b, 3a)  benzoyl  derivatives.  The spectra  show additionally  that  the aromatic  protons  in all trisubstituted  derivatives  are  vicinal  and that  the hydroxyls  in all derivatives  are  chelated  (t ca - 1). This fact is confirmed  by UV AlCl,-  shifts. The OCH. Me. CH, units of la-lf, 2a, 2b and the  OCH,  unit of 3a could, a priori, be part of two pairs of  fundamental  skeleta,  respectively  8 or 9 and 10 or 11.  While the phthalide  skeleton  (10) can be adopted  for 3a  (Vlll,, 1742 cm- ‘) in preference  to the  coumaranone  alternative  (11) which should give rise to a carbonyl  band  at considerably  lower frequency  [6], discrimination  of  chelated  dihydroisocoumarins  (8) and chromanones  (9)  is difficult  (for  both  vmsx 1660-1670 cm-‘).  It was  necessary  to ‘measure  the carbonyl  frequency  of the  methyl ethers lg and lh (v,,  ca 1725 cm-‘)  in order to  obtain evidence  that these compound  are esters (8) and  not ketones  (9). It was considered  that a more reliable  distinction  between  structural  types  8 and 9 may be  possible  by PMR.  Clearly,  spfitting  of the OCHCH,  proton  bands will be highly sensitive to conformation  of  511  512  M. A.DEALVARXNGA~~  al.  Table 1.

The synthesis ofmodel chromanones  was accomplished  by Friedel-Crafts  reactions  of crotonic  anhydride  [2] on  three  substrates:  2,4-dihydroxytoluene  (12a), 2,4-di-  hydroxybenzaldehyde  (12b) and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-  benzaldehyde  (12~). Several previously  unreported  com-  pounds were thus obtained.  In the 60 MHz PMR spectra  of the 2-methylchromanones  13a, 13b, 13c, 14 and 15 the  protons  at C-2  were  uniformly  represented  by an  apparent  sextet (J = 7 Hz) and the protons  at C-3 were  represented  by a doublet  (J = 7 Hz). (Slight secondary  splitting  of peaks, observed  in some cases, is not taken  into consideration).  By this criterion,  only lb could be a 2-methylchroma-  none.  Its methyl  ether  lh, however,  shows  the very  different  OCHCH,  PMR pattern.  typical of the methyl  either lg and of the natural compounds  la, lc-lf,  2a, 2b.  Here the oxymethine  is represented  by a multiplet  and  the vicinal  methylene  by two double  doublets.  Thus,  although  two types of spectra  are indeed obtained,  con-  formational  effects for derivatives  of an identical skeleton  (lb vs lh) may obscure  the issue.  A further  phenomenon  which  can be attributed  to  conformation  concerns  the considerable  diamagnetic  effect exerted on H-5 (r 3.60) of lb. This, possibly hyper-  conjugative,  effect can be cancelled  by modification  of  the geometry  of the heterocycle  through  interruption  of  the chelate bridge. Thus, after methylation  to lh, the H-5  signal appears  at the normal frequency  (I. 3.04) expected  for aromatic  protons  para or ortho related to one oxygen  function.  Less subject to conformational  than to constitutional  causes, MS should solve the problem  at hand. Through  retro-Diels-Alder  cleavages,  the isocoumarins  (8) are  expected  to loose  acetaldehyde,  whereas  the chroma-  nones are expected to loose propene.  Indeed, while loss of  42 mass units leads to the major and often the base peak  of the MS of all synthetic  chromanones  (13-15) the mole-  cular ion, which gives the base peak in the spectra  of  most natural compounds  of series 1 and 2, looses 44 mass  umts. The structural  type 8, to which consequently  all  these  natural  compounds  belong,  is characterized  by  loss of 18 mass units (Table 3) which is an additional  distinctive  MS feature in comparison  with type 9.  The  3-methyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarin  structure  for  la was confirmed  by NaBH,  reduction  of its methyl  ether lg to 16a, which was characterized  by PMR and  MS of its diacetate  16b. Mps, UV, IR, PMR [7] and MS,  as well as the negative rotations  [8] of la and lg, identi-  fied la with the known  (3R)-8-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-  3,4-dihydroisocoumarin  (5-methylmellein).  The evidence  concerning  the vicinality of its two aromatic  protons  thus  leads to the 7-methylmellein  structure  for lb.  Placement  of the substituents  at C-5, rather  than at  C-7, in the formulae  for lc-lf  and 2a followed three sets  of observations:  (1) exchange  of the Me of la by the  CHO  of lc causes  a 1 ppm paramagnetic  shift of the  He,-4 PMR signal, and air oxidation  of lc gives Id; (2)  le 1s not a catechol  and methylation  of le gives If; (3)  the PMR  of 2a shows  a -0.3  ppm pyridine  Induced  solvent  shift [9] for the ArH signal, revealing  OH/H  vicinality,  and a 3.0:2.5 height ratio for the OMe/Me  peaks, revealing  Me/CH,  interaction.  Placement  of the  Me rather than other substituents  at C-5 in the formulae  of 2b and 3a was based on the PMR spectrum  of 2b in  which the 3.0:2.3 height  ratio for the OMe/Me  peaks  was shifted to 3.0:3.3 by double irradiation  at the CHZ  frequency  and the PMR  spectrum  of 3a in which the  1.1:3.0:2.0 height ratio for the CH,/OMe/Me  peaks was  shifted to 2.0:3.0 for CHJOMe  by double irradiation  at  the Me frequency.

DISCUSSION  The recent literature  reports  the occurrences  of three  further  dihydroisocoumarins  2c (6-methoxymellein),  26  and 2e in Kigelia pinnata DC. (Bignoniaceae)  [S] and of  the phthalide  3b (djalonensin)  in Anthocleistu  djulonensis  A. Chev. (Loganiaceae)  [lo]. The stem bark of the latter  species  is also reported  to contain  lichexanthone.  We  have isolated  lichexanthone  accompanied  by physicion  twice from higher plants. In the first case [11] the presence  of both compounds  was subsequently  proved to be due  to contamination  of the plant material  (Licuria puchury-  major  (Mart.)  Kosterm.,  Lauraceae)  by  the  lichen  Graphinia co&ens  Fee (Graphidiaceae)  [ 121 identified  by Dr. Mason E. Hale Jr. In the second case [3] we were  not able, a posteriori,  to secure  a fresh sample  of the  extracted  plant  material  (Caruipu  costutu  Spruce  ex  Benth.,  Guttiferae).  This was also true for the wood  samples  1, 2, 4-10 (Table  1) described  in the present  paper. The point to be emphasized,  nevertheless,  is that  all plant material  must be thoroughly  examined  for con-  taminating  organisms  prior to extraction,  if it is desired  to avoid uncertainty  concerning  the origin of the isolated  compounds.  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation of the compounds. The C,H,  extracts  of trunk wood  samples  of the imhcated  species (Table 1) were submItted  to Si  gel column  chromatography  The fractions  were purified  by  TLC on SI gel.
