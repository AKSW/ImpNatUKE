Abstract-The  trunk wood of an Amazonian  Nectandra (Lauraceae)  species contains  one bicyclo[3.2.l]octanoid  and four hydrobenzofuranoid  neolignans.  The latter  comprise  representatives  of the mirandin,  the rearranged  burchellin  and the burchellin  types. The former  was characterized  as (lS, 4R, .5S, 6R, 7R)-3-allyl-4-hydroxy-l-  methoxy-(3’,  4’, 5’-trimethoxypheny1)-7-methy1-8-oxobicyclo[3.2.l]oct-2-ene  (macrophyllin-B),  a new represen-  tative of the seemingly  rare macrophyllin  type.  INTRODUCTION  Trunk wood for the present  study was collected  from a  lauraceous  tree  at Rosa  de Maio,  a locality  on the  Manaus-Itacoatiara  highway  (km 8), Amazonas,  by  Dionisio  Coelho.  According  to Dr. Klaus  Kubitzki,  Hamburg,  the specimen,  voucher  Herbarium  INPA,  Manaus,  No. 46.534  (20 February  1974), belongs  to  an unclassified  Nectandra  species.  Indeed  mirandin-A  (la), which proved  to be its major neolignan,  is known  to occur  additionally  in Nectandra  miranda [2]. For  reasons  stated  in a previous  paper  of this series  [3],  nomenclature  and numbering  of this and other neolig-  nans follow the rules which were outlined  in a recent  review  [4].  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Fractionation  of the C6H6 extract  gave crystalline  mirandin-A  (la),  besides  minor  quantities  of  burchellin-type  [4, 51 (2, 3a, 3b) and macrophyllin-  type [4, 61 (4a) neolignans.  While  la, 2 and 3a had  been  isolated  previously  from  Nectandra  miranda  Sandw. [2]; from N. miranda [2] and Aniba simulans  Allen  [7]; and from  A. afinis  [8] and A. burchellii  Kosterm.  [9], respectively,  and were thus identifiable  by direct comparison  with known  compounds,  3b and  4a were novel neolignans.  Compounds  3a and 3b were  isolated  as a mixture  whose  separation  was  not  achieved  by  Si  gel  *Part  56  in  the  series  “The  Chemistry  of  Brazilian  Lauraceae”.  For Part  55 see ref.

The  IR and UV  characteristics  of  this product  and pure 3a [8] were closely comparable.  The MS, however,  showed,  besides  peaks  at m/e 356  (M+‘), 315 [(M-allyl)‘]  and  178 [(MeO)&H&H=  CHMe’.],  diagnostic  of 3a, corresponding  peaks  at  m/e 386, 345 and 208 of comparable  heights.  Since all  other  neolignans  of the species  under  scrutiny  sustain  a  tri-0-methylpyrogallyl  substituent,  it  was  im-  mediatly  suspected  that this may be the case also for  3b, and account  for the observed  MS peaks.  Indeed,  the 60 MHz  ‘H NMR  contained,  besides  the broad  singlet  at S 6.85  typical  of the C-2,  C-S and C-6  protons  of a veratryl  group,  a fine singlet  at S 6.55,  compatible  with the C-2 and C-6 protons  of a pyrogal-  lyl group. With the exception  of the typical  3H-9 and  2H-7’  signals,  which  appeared  at slightly  different  frequencies,  all other  peaks  for 3a and  3b in the  spectrum  of the mixture  were coincident.  A conclusive  carbon-count  for  both  compounds  was  given  by a  proton-decoupled  13C NMR  spectrum.  Significant  differences  of signal frequencies  were noted  solely for  the  carbons  of the  aromatic  rings.  All assignments  la Ar=a-Tp  lb Ar=P-Tp  3n Ar=Ve  3b Ar=Tp  OMe  ‘R2  4a R’=H,R’=OH  4b R’+R’=O  659  660  R. BRAZ FILHO eta1  were  checked  by single  frequency  off-resonance  de-  coupling  which led to the expected  band multiplicities.  The relative  configuration  of 3a was established  by  consideration  of chemical  shifts for atoms at positions  7, Y and 7’ 1 IO]. As the analogous  values for 3b are  substantially  identical.  both  compounds  must possess  identical  relative  configurations  and  conformations.  Since,  furthermore.  the ORD  curves  of the mixture  and of pure 3a 18. I I]  were closely  comparable,  the  absolute  configuration  shown  in 3b represents  the  novel neolignan.  Determination  of the MW by MS, allied  to hyd-  rogen.  carbon  and methoxyl  counts by NMR. revealed  the formula  C,,H,,O,  (OMe),  for compound  4a sug-  gesting  another  bis-arylpropanoid  compound.  Indeed,  as in analogous  cases [4], a prominent  MS fragment  ion at m/c 208 (45%)  and the symmetry  of the aryl  substitution  indicated  by  NMR  data  revealed  the  constitution  of one of the C,C%-moieties  (5).  The additional  C,C,-group  had an ally1 on a trisub-  stituted  double  bond  (2H-7’, S 3.00, tl, J = 7 Hz). The  fact that the only vinylic  proton  (H-6’.  ?i 5.62) was  represented  by a singlet  with only allylic broadening  indicated  vicinality  of this methine  to a tetrasubsti-  tuted  carbon.  ‘This double  bond  was part of a secon-  dary  ally1 alcohol  since  oxidation  of the compound  with MnO,  led to an a.@-unsaturated  ketone  (4b. v,,,  1680 cm ‘), a transformation  which produced  a 1.13  ppm paramagnetic  shift of the olefinic p (H-6’) proton.  The secondary  nature  of the alcohol  was confirmed  by  acctylation.  The doublet  (6 4.72, .I = 5 Hz) due to the  carbinolic  proton  (H-2’)  suffered  a  I.08  ppm  paramagnetic  shift. The multiplicity  of this signal indi-  cated the vicinity of a further  methine.  Since the signal  of the corresponding  proton  appeared  at 6 2.60, the  yet  unassigned  methoxyl  (6  3.54)  could  only  be  situated  at the previously  mentioned  tetrasubstituted  carbon.  The carbonyl  (v,,,,  17.50 cm ‘). which  must  link these  trisubstituted  and tetrasubstituted  carbons  in order to complete  the C,-unit  6. was also part of the  H  ‘OH  S  6  pentacycle  formed  by joining  5 and 6. Of the two ways  this can be done.  4a alone must represent  the correct  alternative.  Indeed,  there was a slight coupling  (J,,,,tr._q.  = 0.8 Hz)  between  the bridgehead  and the benzylic  protons.  The interpretations  of this, as well as all other  proton  couplings,  were confirmed  by a complete  series  of decoupling  experiments  at 270 MHz.  The relative  configurations  of the substituents  of the  bicyclo[3.2.  I]oct-2-ene  skeleton  of 4a were  deduced  from the 3H-9 proton  signal at relatively  low field (6  1.05) indicative  of the Me/Ar  truns-relationship.  and  the coupling  constant  between  H-2’. H-3’ (5 Hz) which  was, according  to the  Karplus  equation,  compatible  only with the p&o-configuration  for the hydroxyl  at  C-2’.  The absolute  configurational  details  indicated  in 4  were  determined  by  comparison  with  the  bicyclo[3.2.  I]oct-2-ene  (7). This compound  was ob-  tained  by acid-catalysed  rearrangement  of mirandin-A  (la) of known  stereochemistry  L2.111. The reaction  proceeds  hq way of an intermediate  henzylic  ion 8  0,Me  7  8  [ 121. The  centre  at C-5’  is not  atfected,  i.e.  the  methoxyl  is not eliminated,  since not only in MeOH.  but also in EtOH,  7 is the sole reaction  product.  The  aryl substituent  in the end product  7 could thus appear  cis- or rrans-oriented  with respect  to Me-S. OnI) the  ITCUIS derivative  (3H-9’,  8 1.09) was obtained.  All  other  substituents.  however.  must retain  the ahsolutc  configurational  identity  durmb I the transformation  of  la into 7.  Spectral  comparison  of 7 and  4b. the oxidation  product  of 4a, showed  the compounds  to be contigura-  tionally  different.  H-7 resonated  at higher field in 7 (ii  2.47) than in 4a (S 2.60). a reflection  of the relnti\c  situations  with respect  to the C-2’ carbonyl:  H-7 is  endo  in 7, where  it receives  anisotropic  shielding  by  the carbonyl  and so H-7 is cxo in 4b. Analogously,  H-6’ resonated  at lower field in 7 (6 7.051 than in 4b  (8 6.75).  a retlection  of the relative  situations  with  respect  to the C-7 aryl and the C-8 methyl:  Ar-7 mu>t  he exo in 7. where it cannot  exert anisotropic  shielding  on H-6’ and must bc endo in 4b; Me-8 which is c~~rio  in 7, where it exerts electronic  repulsion  on FI-6’. must  be exe in 4b. The clearest  evidence  for the orientation  of Ar-7  related  to Me-S  on one  hand  and to the  carbonyl  at C-2’ on the other,  however.  was given h>  17C NMR data. C-9 of 7 (8 13.S) and C--2’ of 4b iii  1X9.31 resonated  at higher  field than  their  counter--  parts  in the alternative  compounds  (C-Y of 4b at 6  1.5.6: C-2’ of 7 at S lY4.2). a5 reflections  of stronger  y-effects  within  the cyclic systems.  Contrasting  clec-  tronic  interactions  between  the aryl and ring system  arc evidenced  also by the IR carbonyl  absorptlons  of 7  (v,,,,  1667 cm ‘1 vs 4b jv,,,,  1680 cm ‘1 (cf. [c)]).  With the establishment  of the relative  configuration  of 4b its absolute  configuration  could  be deduced.  Indeed,  the ORD curve of 7 showed  a positive  Cotton  effect at 307 nm and a negative  Cotton  effect at 282  nm assigned  to the  aryl and  enone  chrornophores.  rcspcctively.  Both  these  effects  were  positive  in the  case of 4b, revealing  identical  chirality  for the benzylic  C-7 and antipodal  chirality  for C-3’ and C-5’ vicinal to  the enone  group.  According  to these  facts,  and the  above  deduction  of the relative  configuration  of the  hydroxyl  at C-4’,  structure  4a is proposed  for the  natural  neolignan.  The novel compound  4a is designated  macrophyliin-  B since  it belongs  to a neolignan  type  so far rep  resented  only by macrophyllin,  now suffixed  A. from  Licarin  rmcrophylln  161.

A  previous  hydrobenzofuranoid-  bicyclo[3.2.l]octanoid  rearrangement  [12] was  per-  formed  at room  temperature  [13]. Under  the milder  conditions,  however,  la isomerized  to lb [2] (32%),  and added the elements  of water and methanol  leading  to the products  9a (18%) and 9b (31%). Relevant  features  of the  ‘H NMR  data  of 9a and 9b were  comparable  with  those  for pipernone  (9c), an anti-  feeding  neolignan  of Piper  futokadzura  for  which  !#a Ar=Tp,R=H  9b Ar=Tp,  R=Me  9c Ar=Pi,  R=Me  only  a constitutional  formula  is available  [14].  All  three derivatives  should thus possess  the same relative  stereochemistry.  This is defined  by experimental  evi-  dence  for C-6, C-7, and C-5’, while construction  of a  model  reveals  the  trans-ring  juncture  to be highly  strained.  Alternative  cyclization  modes  of benzylic  ions such  as 10, whose preferred  direction  seems to be governed  mainly by stereochemical  factors  [12], rationalizes  the  co-occurrence  of 8.1’-linked  neolignans  of the bur-  chellin  (3)  and  guianin  (11) type  in  extracts  of  Lauraceae  species  (cf. [9,  11, 131). Now  that  the  co-occurrence  of mirandin  (1) and marcophyllin  (4)  types  has been  established,  the  relationship  of the  8.5’4inked  neolignans  can be assumed  to be mediated  by intermediates  such as 8.  EXPERIMENTAL  Isolation  of the constituents.  Trunk  wood  reduced  to saw  dust  (4.5 kg) was percolated  with  C,H6  at room  temp.  A  powdery  mixture  of extract  (100 g) and Si gel (200 g) was  washed  successively  with  petrol,  C,H,  and  CHCl,  and  MeOH  giving respectively  fractions  A,, A, and A,. A, (18 g)  was separated  by filtration  into crystalline  la (9 g) and oily  aliphatic  material.  A, (4 g) in EtOH  deposited  a solid which.  after  separation  by centrifugation  and washing  with EtOIj,  gave a colourless  powder  of aliphatic  esters (350 mg). A, (35  mg) was in part  (15 g) chromatographed  on Si gel (200 g),  elution  with  C,H,-Me,CO  of indicated  proportions  giving  fractions  B, (l:O),  B, (9.5:0.5),  B, (9:1),  B, (8.5:1.5),  B,  (8:2).  B, (2.2 g) and B, (2.7 g) were composed  respectively  of la, 4a and 2, 4a, which were separated  by repeated  TLC  (Si gel, CHCI,):  la (750 mg, R, 0.80), 2 (810 mg, Rf 0.71),  4a (160 mg, Rf 0.76).
