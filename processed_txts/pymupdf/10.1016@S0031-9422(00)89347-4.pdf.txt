Abstract-Pinoresinol  dimethyl  ether,  secoisolariciresinol,  lariciresinol,  isolariciresinol  and  isolariciresinol-4’-  methyl ether were isolated  from the knots of dead trees of Araucaria  angustifolia.  The 13C NMR  spectra  of these  compounds,  their methyl and acetyl derivatives,  and the corresponding  one of matairesinol,  have been recorded  and  the signals assigned.  On the basis of these assignments,  the structure  of the new monomethyl  ether of isolariciresinol  has been established.  INTRODUCTION  In continuation  with the work on the constituents  of  Araucaria  angustifolia  0. Ktze, [l] the components  of  the knot  benzene  extract  were examined.

The availability  of representative  members  of the  main classes of lignans [2] and the considerable  interest  focused  on the 13C NMR  spectral  studies  of this and  related families ofnatural  products,  [3-6] prompted  us to  undertake  an analysis  of these substances,  as an aid in  the structure  elucidation  of new compounds  and also, as  part  of a project  on the 13C NMR  spectroscopy  of  natural  products  [7].  2  7  9  5’  3a: R, = R, = Me  3b: R, = Me, R, = H; R, + R, = CH,  3c.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Table  1 shows  the 6 values  of compounds  24c,  since  the shifts of compound  1. has already been reported  [3].  The spectra  of secoisolariciresinol,  2a. shows  10 signals  which were assigned on the basis of chemical  shift theory  [8], comparison  with shifts of related  products  [5] and  analysis  of the SFORD  spectrum.  The transformation  of2a into its tetraacetyl  derivative  2b. causes the expected  changes  and confirms  the above assignment.  The nonaromatic  carbons  of matairesinol  3a [ll]  have their shift assigned by comparison  with the recently  reported  6 values  of like carbons  of pluviatolide  and  hinokinin.  3b and 3c, respectively  [IS]. Although  differen-  ces can be observed  in the shifts of comparable  sites of  both benzene rings of3a. they are too small to be analyzed.  In lariciresinol4a.  however, the differences  ofthe aromatic  carbon  shifts  are larger  and  they  were  assigned  by  comparison  with related  products,  compound  2a for  ring A and the neolignan  licarin  A, 5 [5] for ring B.  5  Carbon-l’,  C-2’ and  C-6’ are shielded,  probably  by  steric compression,  and C-4’ is deshielded,  in relation  to  the same carbons  of ring A. The nonaromatic  carbons  of 4a were assigned  by standard  chemical  shift theory,  analysis  of the SFORD  spectrum  and expected  changes  on acetylation,  4b. Carbon-7  and C-9’ exhibit  also the  shielding  effect observed  on C-l’, C-2’ and C-6’. and  resonate  upfield  in comparison  with C-7 and C-9 of  2a. The assignment  of 4c was based on the same argu-  ments.  ThenonaromaticcarbonsofisolariciresinoldiMeether  6a, were split into two groups on the basis of their signal  multiplicities  from a SFORD  spectrum.  which  shows  triplets  at 33.2, 62.6 and 66.2 ppm and doublets  at 39.9.  48.0 and 48.2 ppm. The 33.2 ppm signal was assigned to  C-7’ and the remaining  ones to C-9’ and C-9, using trans-  4-t-butylcyclohexylmethanol  as reference  [9].

On C-9 this effect is enhanced  by the  vicinal aryl group.  The methines at 39.9.48 and 48.2 ppm were distinguish-  ed by analysis  of the corresponding  diacetyl  derivatrve,  6b, carbon shifts. and comparison  with the shifts of related  carbons  of tmns-dimethylcyclohexane,  7. and phenyl-  cyclohexane,  8 [8]. As expected.  acetylation  induces  deshielding  of the carbinyl carbons  [IO] and shielding  of  their neighbours  by magnitudes  normal  for saturated  alcohols:  the signal  at 48 ppm,  which  is practically  unaffected  in the  transformation  can  be therefore.  assigned  to C-7. The distinction  of remaining  methines  is founded  on the fact that C-8. which suffers an n-effect  by C-Y, and two b-effects  by C-9’ and the dimethoxy-  benzene  ring. should  be deshielded  in comparison  to  C-8’.  For the assignment  of the aromatic  carbons  of 6a,  an exhaustive  analysis of the spectra of the monomethyl  ether 6c. obtained  by careful  methylation  of isolarici-  resinol, the monomethyl  ether isolated  from A. angusti-  f&n,  6e, and their corresponding  di- and triacetyl  deri-  vatives  6b, 6d and 6f, was undertaken.  The aromatic  methines  were assigned  by their  multiplicities  in the  SFORD  spectrum,  standard  chemical  shift theory  [S]  and comparison  of the shifts of the 6 compounds  with  each other. Comparison  of the quaternary  carbon  shift  data of 6a, 6c and 6d, permits  the assignment  of the  signals at 128.1 and 137.6 ppm of 6a. to C-l’ and C-6’  502  s. F.
