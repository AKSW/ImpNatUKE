GOTTLIEB  Instituto de Qufmica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, 05508 S&o Paulo, SP, Brazil  (Received 11 August 1982)  Key Word Index-I%&  sebifera; Myristicaceae; seeds, pericarp; dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans.  Abstract-The  fruits of Virola sebijka  contain  in the seed (2R, 3S)-3-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-(3,4-methylenedioxy-  benzyl)-butyrolactone,  and in the pericarp (2R, 3R)-3-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-(3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl)-butyro-  lactone,  (2R, 3R)-2,3-di-(3, 4-dimethoxybenzyl)-butyrolactone  and  (2R, 3R)-2,3-di-(3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl)-  butyrolactone.  The seeds of Virola sebifera Aubl. were found to contain,  besides the previously reported l,ll-diarylundecan-l-one  and Caryltetralone  neolignans  [2], the cis-dibenzyl-  butyrolactone  lignan, 1. In the pericarp, however, two  equally  novel  trans-dibenzylbutyrolactone  lignans  (2a, 2b) were found to accompany (-)-hinokinine  (2~).  The IR carbonyl absorptions (v,, 1773 + 6 cm-‘) ofall  four isolates suggested the presence of a butyrolactone  system. Indeed, as 13C NMR evidence (Table 1) suggests  by comparison  with the known derivative 2c [3], all  compounds  must be 2,3-dibenzylbutyrolactones.  The  *Part  XIX in the series “The Chemistry  of Brazilian  Myristicaceae”. For Part XVIII see ref. [l]. Taken from part of  the doctorate thesis presented by L. M. X. L. to the Universidade  de Sao Paul0 (1982).  nature of the substituents  at C-2 and C-3 can be de-  termined by mass spectrometry [4] (Table 2). According  to Corrie et al. [S], relative configurations in 2,3-dibenzyl-  butyrolactones  are given by NMR comparison  of the  methylene protons at C-4. Equivalence of these protons  corresponds  to  the  cis-configuration,  while  non-  equivalence corresponds  to the trans-configuration.  In  this respect, 1 as well as the model compound 3 [S, 61,  must be cis-oriented, while Za-2c as well as the model  compound  2d [4] must be trans-oriented  (Table 3).  Finally the opposite ORD curves for the cis-derivative 1  (C91476  - m CdJl:‘ocI  - 2700), and the model compound  3 ([+I&  + 2300, [4]&  + 4500) [6] establish the ab-  solute configuration of the former. The ORD curves of the  trans-derivatives  2a and 2b are comparable  with the  curves of the model compounds 2c and 2d [6].

Fractionation ofa seed extract [2] was  carried out by dry CC. The column was cut into 33 portions.  Portions 15-23, purified by repeated TLC, gave a major con-  stituent (2.1 g [2]). Elution of one of the remaining bands on the  plate gave 1 (35 mg). An additional quantity of fruits was  collected from a specimen growing near Cajuru, %o Paulo State,  by Hipolito F. Paulino Filho, UNESP, Araraquara. The seeds  were removed and the pericarp was dried, reduced to powder  (1 kg) and extracted with C&H, at room temp. The solvent was  evaporated and the residue (31 g) crystallized from MeOH to give  acylglycerols (10 g). The mother liquor was evaporated and the  residue (21 g) submitted to dry CC (400 g Si gel, CHCl,-EtOAc,  19: 1). The column was cut into three equal portions which were  extracted with MeOH. Evaporation of the solns gave three  residues corresponding to the lower (L), the middle (M) and the  top (T) portions of the column. The residue L (7.1 g) was, in part  (1.6 g), separated by TLC (Si gel, CHCI,-EtOAc,  9: 1) into 2a  (130 mg) and 2c (120 mg). The residue M (6.8 g),. chromato-  graphed on a Si gel column, gave 2b (300 mg); besides other  products which, as also the residue T (5.5 g), were not further  examined.
