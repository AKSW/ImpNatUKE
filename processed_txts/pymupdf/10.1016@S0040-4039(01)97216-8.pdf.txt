The foregoing faot8 oan bert be aooommodated by po8tulating a  oondewation  of the aglfoone8 with MaoetY&,  uith elimination of water (CqE602=86,  -E2ol68).

Hild aoetylation of XIII (Ao201gy, r.t.) gave a prlnolpal (70$) prodtrot  Xvf,  Ip.  Q. 188-195', with a slmpllfled NHE rpeotrum (lndloated  berlde EtrUOtUre),  negU-  glble fluoreeoenoe,  and a UV apeotrua nearly ldentloal uith that of peraoetyl-I  (1). The maaes  speotrum of this oompound &owed It to be trlaoetylated;  the lnfm-  red speotrua reveeled only phenol10 aoetate groups, and an unsaturated  ketone bmd  of greater Intensity than that of the parent XIII. This prlnolpal produot ha6  evidently undergone the re-aromatization  frequently  observed in qulaone a&hider  (8); In view of lte W apeotral oharaoterl~tlos,  It should have the unsaturated  ketone sldeohaln at C-5 twlated out of oonjugatlon  with the aroaatlo ring by ate-  rlo pre8mare from the nelghborlng  aoetoxy group.  The aoetplation of XIII gave, beaIde XVI, an lneeparrble  mixture of two  trlaoetates  with very strong yellow-white  fluoreaoenoe. The W apeotrua of thlm  mixture lndloated addltlonal oonjugatlon to the ammatlo system; an allptmtlo  aoetoq group uaa evident from the IE wFx 1735 or."), aa8a (H+ - 59), and UNR  speotra.  This latter speotrua strongly auggeated the preuenoe of a 281 alxture  of the oonjugated nethjlene-healaoetal  aoetate XVII aad the vlnfl ether XVIII  3504  No. 3s  resulting from l,&addltlon of aoetlo aoid. Clarifloatlon  of the indloated NMR  assignmsnts  and of the nature of the mixture was greatly aided by the use of sjn-  thetio model oompounds, reported in the followlng S~unlOatiOn (9).  AOetylatiOn  of XIV apparently gave but two produots (not yet fully purified), one oorrespon-  ding to XVI and the other (XIK) to XVIII, unmixed with XVII-aMlOgOU8 lraterial.  The possibility  that XIII and XIV might be artefaots produoed upon Florisil  ohromatography  of the orude aglyoone-oontaining  aphid extraots (1) oould be ell-  ninated by the observation  of their presenoe prior to ohronwitography  In fresh ex-  traots of A. neril feeding on either Aeoleolas ouraasavioa or Nerium oleander,  and their deteotion  on thin-layer plates in whloh live aphids were dlreotly  orushed on the origin. These oompounds thus represent two of the very few known  natural produots (10) olearly related in part to biaoetyl, rather than only to  aoetate units joined normally head-to-tail.
