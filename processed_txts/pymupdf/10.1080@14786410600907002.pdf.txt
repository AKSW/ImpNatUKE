Introduction Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells that may affect almost any tissue of the body. Lung, colorectal and stomach cancer are among the most common in the world for both men and women. According to the World Health Organization cancer is responsible for 12% of the world’s mortality [1]. Plants have a long history of use in treatment of cancer and they have provided some of the currently used effective anticancer agents such as vinblastine, vincristine, etoposide, teniposide, and *Corresponding author.

The analysis of the sources of new and approved drugs for the treatment of cancer shows that 60% of these drugs were shown to be of natural origin, being natural compounds or derivatives thereof [3]. In vitro model system with human cells is increasingly used to investigate mechanism of chemical-induced toxicity and for toxicity screening of new drug families. Among the chemical entities assayed against cancer cell lines, acridone alkaloids have been a target of study by researchers. The acridone alkaloids are known to have several bioactivities, including antimalarial activity [4–6], antiviral [7,8], and cytotoxicity activity [9–11]. In this article, the isolation of 11 acridone alkaloids and three N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives from Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. and their in vitro cytotoxicity activity on several cancer cell lines are described. 2. Results and discussion The acridone alkaloids and N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives were isolated from the methanol extract of the stem and fresh fruits of Swinglea glutinosa (Bl.) Merr., respectively, and were identified on the basis of spectroscopic methods and comparison of literature data as: glycocitrine-IV (1) [12], 1,3,5-trihydroxy-4-methoxy- 10-methyl-2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)acridin-9(10H)-one (2) [13] and 1,3,5-trihydroxy- 2,8-bis(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-10-methyl-9-acridone (3) [5], citbrasine (4) and citrusinine-II (5) [14], citrusinine-I (6) [15], 5-dihydroxyacronycine (7) [16], pyrano- foline (8) [17], dihydro-3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-2,2,7-trimethyl-2H-pyrano[2,3-a] acridin-12(7H)-one (9), 2,3-dihydro-4,9-dihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxy-propan-2-yl)-11-meth- oxy-10-methylfuro[3,2-b]acridin-5(10H)-one (10) [13] and bis-5-hydroxyacronycine (11) [18], N-(2-{4-[(3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-yl)oxy]phenyl}ethyl)benzamide (12), N-(2-{4-[(3,7-dimethyl-4-acethyl-octa-2,6-dien-1-yl)oxy]phenyl}ethyl)benzamide (13), and severine acetate (14) [19]. Swinglea is native to the Phillipine Islands but was introduced into Brazil where it grows well. Swinglea belongs to the Aurantioideae subfamily [20], and it is known to contain N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives and protolimonoids [19]. In the Aurantioideae, the relatively small representation of quinolones contrasts with a preferential accumulation of coumarins, acridones, amides, and flavonoids [21]. Thus, the range of compounds that were isolated from Swinglea reinforces its position as a member of the Aurantioideae. Natural and synthetic acridones represent important antitumor drugs. A character- istic example is the natural acridone acronycine (15), which posses an IC50 in leukemia cells in the order of 25 mM [22]. The structure–activity relationships (SAR) of a series of naturally occurring acridones have been studied to determine the effects of these compounds on the inhibition of cell growth and macromolecular biosynthesis of human promyelocytic leukemia cells [23]. Among 50 alkaloids tested, glyfoline (16) was found to be the most active compound (IC50 1.1 mM) and 21 alkaloids were found to be more active than acronycine (IC50 26.2 mM), as compounds 6 (IC50 8.6 mM), 7 (IC50 8.8 mM), and 8 (IC50 7.1 mM). Further studies of glyfoline congeners by [24] revealed that the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the 1-hydroxy and the peri-carbonyl function of the 1-hydroxy-9-acridone nucleus was an important determinant for their cytotoxicity. Other 15 acridones were examined as inducers of HL-60 cell differentiation. These cells were differentiated into mature monocyte/macrophage by 48 P. A. C. Braga et al. Downloaded by [McGill University Library] at 04:35 06 April 2013  atalaphyllidine (17), atalaphyllinine (18), and des-N-methylnoracronycine (19). The activities of NBT reduction (on a minimum of 200 cells), nonspecific esterase, and phagocytosis, were induced by 2.5 mM of 17–19. After a 4-day treatment, 17–19 at 10 mM inhibited clonal proliferation of HL-60 cells by 28, 96, and 63%, respectively. The SAR from the results revealed again that hydroxyl group at C-1 had an important role, as well as a prenyl group at C-2 of the tetracyclic acridones [9]. The same 15 acridones were examined for their antiproliferative effect on monolayers and suspension of several types of cancer cell lines, human lung carcinoma (A-549), melanin pigment- producing mouse melanoma (B-16 melanoma 4A5), T-cell leukemia (CCRF-HSB-2), gastric cancer cell, and lymph-node metastasized (TGBC11TKB) [10]. As a result, atalaphyllidine (17), atalaphyllinine (18), des-N-methylnoracronycine (19), and 5-hydroxy-N-methylseverifoline (20) showed potent antiproliferative activity against tumor cell lines. The SAR established from the results revealed that a secondary amine, hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-5, and a prenyl group at C-2 played an important role for antiproliferative activities of the tetracyclic acridones [23].

This stimulated us to test these alkaloids on other types of cancer cell lines, the human lung carcinoma cell line, Cytotoxicity activity of derivatives from S. glutinosa (Bl.)

The sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay was used to test cytotoxicity against all cell lines and vinblastine sulfate (Sigma) was used as a positive control. The IC50 values of antitumor activity of the eleven acridone alkaloids and three N-phenylethyl-benzamide derivatives on COR-L23, MCF7, C-32, and MRC-5 are summarized in table 1. Unfortunately, in spite of their promising structural features, none of the acridone tested exhibited high level of cytotoxicity, with IC50 values ranging from 47.5 to 93.3 mM. In previous studies, di- and monoprenylate acridones were shown to be more active than acronycine (IC50 26.2 mM) on human leukemic HL-60 cell. Examples are 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2,4-bis(3-methyl- but-2-enyl)-10-methyl-9-acridone; with IC50 13.7 mM, and 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-(3-methyl- but-2-enyl)-5-methoxyl-10-methyl-9-acridone with (IC50 10.1 mM) [10]. However, acridone congeners 1–3 did not show significant activity on cancer cell lines COR- L23 (IC50: 14100, 2 66.1, 3 69.1 mM), MCF7 (IC50: 14100, 2 70.4, 34100 mM) and C32 (IC50: 14100, 2 70.1, 3 86.9 mM). In addition, what was particularly surprising in our study was the lack of appreciable activity for compounds 6–8 (COR-L23, IC50: 64100, 7 69.9, 84100 mM; MCF7, IC50: 64100, 7 77.6, 84100 mM, and C32, IC50: 64100, 7 83.9, 84100 mM) since they were found to be more active than acronycine on human leukemic HL-60 cells [10]. Examination of the preceding compilation and our data reveal some impediments to develop a qualitative understanding of structure–activity. Different investigators seldom utilize the same cancer cell lines and interspecific differences in the response of the test cells can easily mask any meaningful observation of SARs. The present results obtained from acridone alkaloids on cancer cell lines COR-L23, MCF7 and C-32 are reported here for the first time. Among the enormous variety of alkaloids Table 1.

They were found to possess pronounced cytotoxic activity. In order to find potential lead compounds, Rutaceous alkaloids deserve more attention as anticancer agents.

This is the first report of cytotoxic, activity of N-phenylethyl-benzamide, but their lack of selectivity precludes any clinical application. However, it is possible that analog could be developed that would show selectivity and these would be of greater interest as lead compounds.

Isolation of compounds 3.3.1. Alkaloids. The parts of the plant were extracted separately with n-hexane at room temperature for 3 days, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure at 40�C, this procedure was done three times to yield the hexane crude extract. The residue was extracted as the same way using MeOH to yield the n-hexane and methanol crude extract. The MeOH crude extract 60 g was fractioned by VCC over 1 kg of silica gel 60 (70–239 mesh, Merck) eluting with 1.5 L of the solvents: C6H14 100% (fraction 1), CH2Cl2 100% (fraction 2), CH2Cl2 : CH3OH 3 : 1 (fraction 3); CH2Cl2 : CH3OH 2 : 1 (fraction 4); CH2Cl2 : CH3OH 1 : 1 (fraction 4) and CH3OH 100% (fraction 5). Fractions 2 and 3 were combined after analyses with TLC. The result was chromatographed on silica gel eluted with CH2Cl2; the polarity was increased by addition of 5, 10, 13, 18, 20, and 25% of MeOH in a gradient system to yield 15 fractions. Lupeol was crystallized from the fractions 1–3. The fraction 5 was rechromatographed on Si gel eluted with n-hexane–acetone 1 : 3 and gel permeation CC (Sephadex LH 20, 60 � 4 cm2; MeOH) yield alkaloids 1 (3.5 mg), 2 (16.3 mg), 3 (30.4 mg), 4 (11.2 mg), 7 (9.8 mg), 8 (13.4 mg), and 11 (5.4 mg).

The latter was rechromatographed as above, elution with hexane–EtOAc 7 : 1 yielded a mixture of 13 and 14. The latter was rechromatographed as described before, elution with hexane–EtOAc 7 : 1 and then by HPLC (column SHODEX ASAHIPAK GS-310 2G; flow rate at 3.0 mL min�1; UV detection at 254 and 365 nm; eluted with CH2Cl2) affording compounds 13 (8 mg) and 14 (9 mg). 3.4. In vitro biological assays 3.4.1. Cell lines. Cancer cell lines used in this work were human lung carcinoma cell line, COR-L23, human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7, the human melanoma cell line, C32 and normal human fetal lung cell line, MRC-5. The cells COR-L23, MCF7 and C32 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplement with 10% heated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% of 2 Mm L-glutamine and 50 mg/Ml penicillin/ streptomycin. MRC-5 were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified minimum essential medium) with 10% FBS, 1% of 2 Mm L-glutamine and 50 mg/Ml penicillin/ streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37�C in a 5% CO2. According to their growth profiles, the follow densities of each cell were used: 1 � 103, 3 � 103, 3 � 103, and 2 � 103 cell/well for COR-L23, C32, MCF-7, and MRC5, respectively. 3.4.2. Preparation of cell suspension for assay. The human cell lines were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The PBS was decanted and cells detached with 2.5 mL of trypsin (Sigma) and PBS was added to a volume of 10 mL. The cell pellet obtained by centrifugation (37�C, 115 r.p.m. and 5 min) was ressuspended in 10 mL of suitable medium to make a cell suspension. The cell density was counted by triplan exclusion in a hemocytometer and then diluted with medium to give the previously determined optimal densities for COR-L23, C32, MCF-7, and MRC5. The cell suspension (100 mL) from each cell were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated at 37�C to allow the attachment. After 24 h the cells were treated with the pure compounds solutions. Each pure compounds was initially dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) and after they were diluted in medium to produce four concentrations of 50, 5, 0.5, and 0.05 mg mL�1. 3.4.3. Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay. The antiproliferative SRB assay was performed to assess growth inhibition by a colorimetric assay that estimates cell number indirectly by staining total cellular protein with the dye SRB [27]. Cells were fixed by layering 100 mL of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA, Aldrich Chemical) on top of grown medium. Cells were incubated at 4�C for 1 h, after which plates were washed five times with water, the excess water drained off, and the plates left to dry in air at room temperature. SRB stain (50 mL; 0.4 in 1% acetic acid) (Sigma) was added to each well and left in contact with the cells for 30 min, after which they were washed with solution Cytotoxicity activity of derivatives from S. glutinosa (Bl.) Merr. 53 Downloaded by [McGill University Library] at 04:35 06 April 2013  of 1% acetic acid and rinsed four times until only dye adhering to the cells was left. The plates were dried at room temperature and 100 mL of 10 mM Tris base pH 10.5 (Sigma) were added to each well to solubilize the dye. The plates were shaken gently for 2 min, and the absorbance of each well was read on a SLT 340 ATTC plate reader (SLT Labinstrument, Australia) at 492 nm. Cell survival was measured as the percentage absorbance compared to the control (nontreated cells). The IC50 values were calculated from the PRISM program obtained by plotting the percentage of survival versus the concentration and interpolated by cubic spine.
