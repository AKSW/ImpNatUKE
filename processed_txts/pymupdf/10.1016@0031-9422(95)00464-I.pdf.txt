Abstract---A new tetrahydrofuran lignan, the (+)-(7S,8R,8'R)-3',4'-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxy-7,9'-epoxylignan-  9-ol, was isolated from kernels of germinated seeds of Virola michelii, besides 10 previously described lignans:  (+)-sesamin, (+)-fargesin, (+)-phillygenin, (-)-hinokinin, (-)-kusunokinin, (-)-dimethylmatairesinol, (+)-lar-  iciresinol dimethyl ether, ( -)-dihydrocubebin, ( -)-2,3-desmethoxy-seco-isolintetralin and ( -)-3',4',-dimethoxy-3',4'-  desmethylenedioxycubebin.  INTRODUCTION  The genus Virola (Myristicaceae) includes 59 species dis-  tributed in one South American rain forest (Venezuela,  Guianas and Brazil). Virola michelii Heckel is widely  spread in the Brazilian Amazon, and it is popularly called  'ucu6ba' [1, 2]. Phytochemical analysis carded out on  a morphologically related species V. venosa revealed the  accumulation of flavones in flowers and pericarps at an  early phase of fruit development [3]. During maturation  such flavones are substituted by lignans, which also accu-  mulate in arils and seeds. Apparently, no detectable  changes occur in the lignan content during germination  [31. In one case of V. surinamensis, a butenolide polyket-  ide and neolignans have also been isolated as major  components in leaves from seedlings and adult plants  [4]. The aim of this work addressed phytochemical in-  vestigations on germinated seeds taken from seedlings  collected beneath the parent tree of V. michelii. Besides 10  previously reported iignans, one new tetrahydrofuran  lignan (la) is described.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Chromatographic  fractionation  of  the  dich-  loromethane extracts from kernels of the germinated  seeds of V. michelii afforded lignans belonging to five  different structural types: (+)-sesamin [5-71, (+)-far-  gesin [8-10], ( +)-phillygenin [7, 111 (furofuran lignans),  (-)-hinokinin  [121,  (-)-kusunokinin  [121,  (-)-  dimethylmatairesinol [12] (dibenzylbutyrolactone lig-  nans),  ( + )-(7S,8R,8'R)-3',4'-dimethoxy-3,4-methylene-  dioxy-7,9'-epoxylignan-9-ol, (+)-lariciresinol dimethyl  fAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed.  ether [13, 14] (tetrahydrofuran lignans), (-)-dihy-  drocubebin [15, 161, (-)-2,3-desmethoxy-seco-isolinte-  tralin [16] (dibenzylbutanediol lignans) and (-)-3',4'-  dimethoxy-3',4'-desmethylenedioxycubebin [17] (diben-  zylbutyrolactol lignan). The structural elucidation of  these lignans was attained by spectroscopic techniques  and by direct comparison with authentic samples.  The new tetrahydrofuran lignan la possesses the mo-  lecular formula CzIH2406 as determined from low res-  olution mass spectroscopy (M + 372) and from 1H and  3C counting in NMR spectra. Its IR spectrum exhibited  a broad band at 3430 cm-~ assignable to a hydroxyl  group. The ~HNMR spectrum showed one methyl-  enedioxyphenyl group at 65.95, two methoxyi groups at  63.87 and six aromatic protons (66.71-6.85), indicating  two trisubstituted  benzene rings. Additionally, its  H NMR spectrum revealed for the aliphatic protons the  same profile as observed for lignans lb and le [18], with  a doublet at 64.79 (6.5 Hz, H-7), two nonequivalent oxy-  methylene protons (dd, 6.4 and 8.4 Hz, H-9'a or H-9'b) at  64.05 and a multiplet at 63.72-3.96 (2 H-9, H-9'a or  H-9'b); one doublet-doublet at 32.93 (4.6 and 12.8 Hz,  H-7'a or H-7'b) and a multiplet at t52.35-2.80 (H-8, H-8',  and H-7'a or H-7'b). Its mass spectrum gave a base peak  at m/z 151 (100%), assignable to 3,4-dimethoxytropylium  ion and ArCH = +OH (Ar = 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)  besides another at m/z 149 (methylenedioxybenzoyl ion).  Both ions arise from a typical cleavage of the tetrahyd-  rofuran lignan. The definition of the substituents in each  aromatic ring as depicted for the structure la was also  supported by the ~3C NMR data obtained for la-lc and  dihydrocubebin (Table 1). The chemical shifts for  aliphatic and aromatic carbons of la were assigned by  comparison with those of lariciresinol dimethyl ether (lb)  [14], dihydrosesamin (le) [18] and dihydrocubebin [15,  1259  1260  M.C.S. VIDIGAL et aL  16]. The assignments of chemical shifts for tetrahyd-  rofuran carbons were assigned by direct comparison to  that of lariciresinol [14] or using dihydrocubebin as  a model compound (Table 1). An important effect ob-  served on chemical shifts of aromatic carbons is due to  a fl-effect caused by the oxygen of the tetrahydrofuran  ring on C-1 of compounds la (137.0) and lc (137.2) as  compared to dihydrocubebin (134.3), and a y-effect on  carbons C-2/C-6 of la (106.3/119.1) and le (106.2/119.0)  as compared to dihydrocubebin (108.1/121.9).  The accumulation of furofuran, tetrahydrofuran,  dibenzylbutanediol and dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans in  seeds has been previously demonstrated in V. venosa [3].  Nevertheless, remarkable differences were observed in V.  elongata in which these lignans accumulate only in its  pericarps, arils and seed coat, while in kernels the pres-  ence of aryltetralins and aryltetralone neolignans are  ubiquitous [19].  The absolute configurations for all isolated lignans  were established as 8R/8'R from optical rotation signals  and/or circular dichroism curves. Indeed, the biosyn-  thetic sequence (+)-furofuran, (+)-tetrahydrofuran,  (-)-butanediol and (-)-butyrolactone, involving the  series 8R/8'R, has recently been proved to occur enzymi-  cally in Forsythia intermedia plants 1-20] and might be the  case in Virola species, considering solely their absolute  configurations.

Seedlings of V. michelii Heckel were  collected in April of 1989, at Gavi~o Reserve (INPA-  WWF), Manaus42aracarai Road, Amazonas State,  Brazil.

The dried  kernels (24.98 g) of the seedling of V. michelii were ground  and exhaustively extracted with CH2CI 2 at room temp.  The CH2CI 2 extracts were concd in vacuo to give a brown  mass (15.63 g, 62.6%). A portion of this extract (10 g),  submitted to CC using solvents of increasing gradient of  polarity (n-hexane, EtOAc and EtOH), gave different  groups of frs (1-14). Frs 1-5 (2395 mg) contained a mixt.  of non-polar materials that was not further investigated.  Frs 6 and 7 (135 mg) were submitted to prep. TLC  (CH2CI2-Me2CO, 0.25%) to give ( +)-sesamin (5.2 rag),  (+)-fargesin (8.3 rag) and (-)-hinokinin (37.2 rag). Frs  8-12 (1321 mg) were subjected to CC on silica gel and  eluted with CH2C12-Me2CO , MeOH to give frs A-N.  Frs B-D yielded (-)-kusunokinin (688.6 rag) and frs  E-G afforded ( -)-dimethylmatairesinol (175.1 rag). Frs  H and I were pooled and recrystallized with MeOH to  give (+)-phillygenin (11.2 mg). Fr K was purified by  prep. TLC (CH2C12-Me2CO, 5%) and yielded la  (4.7 mg)  and  ( -)-3',4'-dimethoxy-3',4'-demethylene-  dioxycubebin (11.5mg). Fr. L was purified by prep.  HPLC (Lichrosorb RP-8 column; 250 x 22 ram; flow rate  12mlmin-1; detection at 254nm) with HzO-MeOH  [3: 17 ~ 3 : 22 (30 min)] to give ( -)-dihydrocubebin  (2.0 rag). Frs 13 and 14 (562 mg) were subjected to CC on  alumina in vacuo using solvents of increasing polarity  (CH2C12, Me2CO and MeOH) affording 8 frs (a-h). Ft.  b and frs d and f afforded (-)-dimethylmatairesinol  (27.6mg) and (+)-lariciresinol dimethyl ether (lb,  21.8 mg), respectively. Frs g and h were purified by  HPLC (Perkin-Elmer C-18 column; 250 x 4.5 ram; flow  Lignans from kernels of Virola michelii  1261  rate 2 ml rain- 1; detection at 254 nm) with H20-MeOH  (3: 7) to  give ( -)-2,3-desmethoxy-seco-isolintetralin  (15.1 mg). All spectral data for the known compounds  were similar to those for authentic samples or lit. values.
