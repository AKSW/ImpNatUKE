Abstract-The  ecdysone abutasterone has been isolated from the Amazonian plant Abuta velutina and its structure  elucidated by spectral means.  In continuation  of a study of alkaloid constituents  of  plants of the Menispermaceae  family an investigation of  the menispermaceous  vine Abuta velutina Gleason, in-  digenous to the Amazon region, was undertaken.  The  present communication  reports the isolation and charac-  terization of a non-alkaloidal  ingredient of the plant.  Extraction of the leafless stem of the vine with methanol  and chromatography  of the extract on Si gel led to a  crystalline  (C,,H,_,Os.H,O)  compound  (0.3 7” of dry  stem wt), mp 257-259”. Its IR spectrum (KBr) revealed  a broad hydroxy absorption band (3380 cm- ‘) and strong  conjugated carbonyl absorption  (1660 and 1640 cm- I),  characteristic of an a&unsaturated  keto unit, and its UV  spectrum (MeOH) exhibited an absorption maximum at  242 nm (E 13 800), characteristic  of a 3-alkyl-2-cyclo-  hejtenone or its acyclic equivalent.  ‘The mass spectrum indicated the compound, herewith  named abutasterone,  to possess an ecdysone-like struc-  ture. In analogy with the behavior of many ecdysones [l]  the compound lacked a molecular ion peak at m/z 496, but  showed a [M - (H,O),]+  peak at m/z 460 as the highest  mass number in the spectrum. The tendency toward the  loss of one or two water units was revealed by all  important mass fragments. Two fragmentation  patterns  revealed the presence of an ecdysone ring system with a  tetrahydroxy  side chain attachment:  (a) fragmentation  mode a in formula  1 yielding a peak at m/z 319  representing the ring system, accompanied by water loss  peaks at m/z 301 and 283, and a side chain peak of m/z 177,  accompanied  by  m/z  159 and  141 peaks;  and  (b) fragmentation  path b affording a peak at m/z 363 for  the ring system together with peaks at m/z 345 and 327 for  water loss, and a side chain m/z 133 peak, along with m/z  115 and 97 peaks [2, 33.  While the m/z 177 and 133 side chain fragments had  shown the presence of a 20-hydroxy group, the following  *Part LXXIX  in the series “Carbon-13  Nuclear  Magnetic  Resonance  Spectroscopy  of Naturally  Occurring  Substances”.

A 13C NMR analysis of abutasterone and comparison  of the chemical shift data with those of kaladasterone (2a)  [4], ecdysterone (2b) [4] and pterosterone (2~) [5] proved  the configuration of the tetracyclic ring system of the three  substances to be identical and confirmed the hydroxy  group attachment  sites of the side chain (Table 1).  Furthermore, inspection of the A&values of the side chain  carbons  for the 2a-2b and Ze-abutasterone  pairs of  ecdysones showed the four substances to possess the same  C-20 and C-22 configuration,  limiting abutasterone  to  structure 2d.  The mps were obtained on a Reichert micro hot-stage and are  uncorr.

Chromatography of 80 g of the extract (291 g) on 800 g Si gel and  elution with C,H,-Me,CO  (9: 1) gave a yellow oil, which was not  investigated further, and 200mg of a mixture of sitosterols, mp  151-154”, identified by GC/MS with an authentic specimen.
