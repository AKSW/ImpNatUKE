The chemical proﬁle of scion and rootstock differ notably for absence in the form of ﬂavonoids and coumarins containing C5 prenyl groups attached to the carbon atoms of aromatic and heterocyclic systems or to oxygen. Only linear pyranocoumarins xanthyletin and xanthoxyletin were found in scion. This observation indicates that the prenylated compounds once biosynthesized in the roots could have been translocated to other organs. Xylella fastidiosa colonizes the xylem of plants causing diseases on several economically important crops such as citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC). A number of ﬂavonoids, coumarins, alkaloids, dihydrocinnamic acid derivative, anacardic acid, triterpenes, and limonoids were tested for in vitro activity on the growth of Xylella fastidiosa. Azadirachtin A was the most active. Hesperidin, which occurs in great amounts in cells of the mesophyll of the affected leaves with CVC, showed a moderate activity suggesting that it can act as a good barrier for small-size colonies from X. fastidiosa. KEYWORDS: Citrus sinensis; C. limonia; grafting; phytochemical studies; Xylella fastidiosa; citrus variegated chlorosis; CVC INTRODUCTION Xylella fastidiosa a Gram-negative bacterium is transmitted by xylem-feeding leafhoppers (Homoptera, Cicadellidae) and colonizes the xylem of plants causing diseases on several economically important crops such as citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) in sweet orange, Pierce’s disease (PD) of grapevine, and coffee leaf scorch (CLS) (1). The generally accepted cause of the symptoms induced by X. fastidiosa is the occurrence of vascular occlusion inside the vessel leading to water stress. It was previously demonstrated that the bacterium is able to grow as a Bioﬁlm, which could be an important factor for pathogenic- ity (1). CVC has been observed in all commercial sweet orange varieties, with transmission occurring mainly by xylem-feeding insects but also by graft propagation (2, 3). Symptoms include leaf chlorosis, stunting, canopy dieback, and fruits that are small and useless for the juicing industry (4). To reduce losses and prevent dissemination of the pathogen, pruning, insecticide application, and healthy nursery trees have been used, but effective control has not been reported. CVC has affected up to 36% of commercial sweet orange trees, causing great economic damage to the Brazilian citrus industry, which produces most of the orange juice in the international market (4). Rangpur lime (Citrus limonia Osbeck) is the key rootstock for citriculture in Brazil, on which more than 80% of citrus trees are grafted. C. limonia trees, developed from the germina- tion of seeds, may be grown in orchards in the presence of high disease and insect pressure, and they do not show foliar symptoms of the disease. However, it does not confer resistance to susceptible sweet orange varieties grafted on to it (2, 3). This information stimulated us to undertake phytochemical studies of the Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck grafted on C. limonia. Thus, roots, stems, and leaves of this combination were examined in order to determine if secondary metabolites present in the rootstock could be translocated into C. sinensis. The roots of C. limonia were also studied to gain a better understanding of * To whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel: + 55 (16) 3351.8093. Fax: + 55 (16) 3351.8350.

The occurrence in great amounts of hesperidin in the cells of the mesophyll of the affected leaves with CVC and xanth- yletin, a linear pyranocoumarin, in the roots of C. limonia, observed with this work, has stimulated us to test hesperidin and some roots coumarins on the growth of X. fastidiosa. The results could clarify the basis of its resistance to X. fastidiosa. However, as part of our efforts to ﬁnd potential lead compounds as bactericides against this economically important phytopatho- genic bacterium, coumarins, ﬂavonoids, alkaloids, dihydrocin- namic acid derivative, anacardic acid, triterpenes, and limonoids isolated from Rutaceae, Meliaceae, and Anacardiaceae plants were also assayed against X. fastidiosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS Phytochemical Analysis. General. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker DRX 400 and ARX 200, with tetramethylsilane as internal standard. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a model Shimadzu SCL- 10A; detection (Shimadzu SCL-10A). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), low resolution, was performed on a HP-2576 instrument. Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MSMS) was performed on a Micromass Quattro LC instrument, equipped with a “Z-spray” ion source. Plant Material.

To prepare fresh isolated bacteria, Citrus sinensis plants were previously inoculated with the 9a5c strain of X. fastidiosa and when CVC symptoms were visible; petioles and stems were collected and aseptically ground in PBS (phosphate- buffered saline). The suspension was distributed on plates containing liquid periwinkle wilt medium (PW) (5). Liquid PW Medium. Into a ﬂask containing 500 mL of distilled H2O was added 4.0 g of phytone peptone (Sigma, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil); 1.0 g of trypticase peptone (Sigma, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil); 1.2 g of K2HPO4; 1.0 g of KH2PO4; and 0.4 g of MgSO4·H2O; by mechanic agitation was added 10 mL of hemin chloride 0.1% [0.1 g of hemin Cl (Sigma, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil), 0.2 g NaOH, and 100 mL H2O]; and 10 mL of phenol red 0.2% (0.2 g of phenol red, 10 drops of NaOH 20%, and 100 mL H2O); and distilled water was added to complete 800 mL. Then this solution was transferred into 10 Erlenmeyer ﬂasks, in a total volume of 80 mL in each, and they were autoclaved at 120 °C for 20 min. After autoclaving, 10 mL of bovine serum albumin (BSA) 10% [6 g of BSA fraction V (Sigma, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil), 100 mL of autoclaved water, and ﬁltered through a 0.22-µm Millipore membrane] and glutamine 4% [4 g of glutamine (Sigma, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil), 100 mL of autoclaved water, and ﬁltered through a 0.22- µm Millipore membrane] were added in each Erlenmeyer ﬂask (5). Solid PW Medium. For the solid medium, 12 g of bacteriological agar was added before adding distilled water to complete 800 mL. Inoculum Preparation. Flasks containing 30 mL of liquid PW medium were inoculated with 1.0 mL of freshly prepared suspensions of X. fastidiosa 9a5c culture grown in solid medium. After 5 days (exponential phase; OD600nm ) absorbance 0.080) or 10 days (stationary phase; OD600nm ) absorbance 0.281) of growth at 28 °C in a rotary shaker at 140 rpm, these cultures were used for inoculation of each medium used in the growth assays. A mix of the Bioﬁlm (with growth attached to the glass at the medium-air interface) and planktonic (not attached) cells were used in minimal inhibitory concentration experi- ments (MIC). Antibacterial ActiVity. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in DMSO (Sigma, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil)/H2O (1:1) and diluted to appropriate concentration prior to assays. In Eppendorf tubes containing 100 µL of bacterial culture in liquid PW medium (exponential phase or stationary phase) were added 0.5, 0.6, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/mL of each tested compound and kept in biological oxygen demand for 24 h at 28 °C, and 100 µL was then transferred to a 96-well microplate containing solid PW medium. The microplates were incubated for 10 days in biological oxygen demand at 28 °C. Growth was monitored by the number of bacterial colonies and by the change in color from yellow to red because phenol red produced a red-pink color (alkalized) after cell growth resulting in the consumption of glucose. The MIC was deﬁned as the lowest test compound concentration, which prevented the visible growth of bacteria. This procedure was carried out in triplicate, and in each case, a blank experiment was performed with DMSO/H2O (1:1) alone (100 µL of bacterial culture, 33.5 µL of DMSO and 33.5 µL of H2O) in the well and was used as a positive control. The growth of X. fastidiosa 9a5c was not signiﬁcantly affected by 40% DMSO/H2O (1:1) alone. The positive control well was prepared without the test compound and only with bacterial culture. Purity Standard. All experiments were carried out with cells veriﬁed as X. fastidiosa by PCR with speciﬁc primers (6, 7). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Centro APTA Citros Sylvio Moreira in Brazil has a citrus sanitation program that cleans citrus material from CVC and other diseases by the use of shoot-tip grafting. There are a limited number of accredited institutions delivering certiﬁed disease-free budwoods Citrus. The Centro APTA has produced certiﬁed budwoods Citrus under favorable phytosanitary condi- tions in a screen house. This work was undertaken on Citrus sinensis grafted on C. limonia produced at this Centre. Roots, stems, and leaves of this graft were studied separately in order to compare their chemical proﬁle (Figures 1–3). The structures of isolated compounds were identiﬁed on the basis of spectral data, particularly 1H and 13C NMR, HSQC, HMBC, and ESI- MSMS, and by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those from the literature. Compounds Isolated from Leaves of C. sinensis Grafted on C. limonia. The hexane extract from leaves after successive chromatographic separations afforded the ﬂavonoids tetra-O- methylscutellarein (4′,5,6,7-tetramethoxyﬂavone) (1), tangeretin (4′,5,6,7,8-pentamethoxyﬂavone) (2) sinensetin (3′,4′,5,6,7- pentamethoxyﬂavone) (3), nobiletin (3′,4′,5,6,7,8-hexamethoxy- ﬂavone) (4), and 3,3′,4′,5,6,7,8-heptamethoxyﬂavonol (5); ﬂa- vanone hesperidin (6); the linear pyranocoumarin xanthyletin (7); and the steroids sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol. The dichloromethane extract from leaves was puriﬁed by repeated column chromatography on silica gel and preparative TLC to give the ﬂavonoids 5-hydroxy-3′,4′,6,7-tetramethoxy- ﬂavone (8), 5-demethoxynobiletin (3′,4′,6,7,8-pentamethoxy- ﬂavone) (9), 5-hydroxy-3′,4′,7,8-tetramethoxyﬂavone (10), cou- marin xanthoxyletin (11), and limonoid limonin (12). The methanol extract from leaves afforded only ﬂavanone hesperidin (6). Flavonoids 1-4 were previously isolated from leaves (8, 9), 1-5 from peel (10), and hesperidin (6) from leaves, stem, and root (11) of sweet orange (C. sinensis). Flavone 8 has been described from sweet orange peel in the inaccessible patent literature (12), 9 from seedless C. depressa Hayata (13), and 10 from bergamot oil from C. aurantium subsp. Bergamia (14). This appears to be the ﬁrst record of 5 and 8 from leaves of C. sinensis and 9 and 10 from this species. Compounds of Citrus sinensis on C. limonia J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 56, No. 17, 2008 7817 Coumarins xanthyletin (7) and xanthoxyletin (11) were previously isolated from the root of C. sinensis but not so far in the leaves of this species (15). The limonoid limonin has been found in fruits (16), roots (17), and shoots (18) of C. sinensis. In the later reference, the authors observed that limonin concentration in shoots decreased during the growing period in the cultivars. However, in this study limonin was found in the leaves of 10 month old C. sinensis plants. Compounds Isolated from the Stems of C. sinensis Grafted on C. limonia. The hexane extract from C. sinensis stems of scion gave the triterpene friedelin (13), coumarin xanthoxyletin (11), and ﬂavanone hesperedin (6). The dichloromethane extract from stems of scion afforded friedelin (13), ﬂavone nobiletin (4), and 3�-O-�-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol. The methanol ex- tract from scion stems yielded only ﬂavanone hesperidin (6). Nobiletin (4) was previously obtained from the dried bark of C. sinensis (19); however, here the stem and bark were studied together. Xanthoxyletin (11) is reported here for the ﬁrst time from the stem of C. sinensis. The pentacyclic triterpene friedelin (13) was previously isolated from the leaves (20) and peel (21) of C. sinensis; thus, it is reported here for the ﬁrst time from the stem. Compounds Isolated from the Stem of the Rootstock of C. sinensis Grafted on C. limonia. When the scion and Figure 1. Structure of ﬂavonoids isolated. Figure 2. Structure of coumarins isolated. Figure 3. Structure of limonoids, triterpene, and alkaloid isolated. 7818 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 56, No. 17, 2008 Ribeiro et al. rootstock are joined, they form a calloused area. It was removed, and only the stem of the C. limonia (rootstock) was studied. The hexane and dichloromethane extracts from this stem were combined and after successive chromatographic separations afforded the coumarins xanthyletin (7), seselin (14), suberosin (15), crenulatin (16), and tamarin (17); the ﬂavonoids limonianin (18), lupinifolin (19), and erythrisenegalone (20); and the acridone alkaloid 5-hydroxynoracronycine (atalaphyllidine, 21). Plants of Citrus sinensis and C. limonia have been widely investigated, but to date, there are no records of studies of their graft working separately with scion and rootstock. The unique investigation of the stem of C. limonia revealed the presence of coumarins imperatorin, xanthotoxin, bergapten, isopimpinel- lin, limettin, scopoletin, umbelliferone, xanthotoxol, and aes- culetin, and the steroids stigmasterol and sitosterol (22). Thus, all compounds obtained here from the stem of the rootstock of C. limonia have not been found in the stem of the plant developed from the germination of seeds. This observation suggests that these constituents could have been translocated from the roots where they have been isolated (23). The literature did not mention tamarin 17 from C. sinensis and C. limonia, but from the roots of hybrid C. paradise Macf. X C. tangerina Hort. Ex Tanaka (24). Thus, the ﬁnding of 17 from the rootstock stem in this study suggested that it might have been biosyn- thesized from suberosin 15 in this part of the graft since it was not found in the roots. The results suggest that the rootstock stem does not biosynthesize metabolites de noVo; however, it is clear that much further work is need to establish whether the metabolic changes are associated with the graft. Compounds Isolated from the Roots of the Rootstock of C. sinensis Grafted on C. limonia. The hexane and dichlo- romethane extracts from the roots of C. limonia rootstock were combined and puriﬁed by repeated column chromatography on silica gel and preparative TLC to give the coumarins xanthyletin (7), xanthoxyletin (11), suberosin (15), crenulatin (16), buntasin (22), (E)-suberenol (23), (Z)-suberenol (24), clausarin (25), and nordentatin (26); the ﬂavanone lupinifolin (19), the limonoids limonin (12), and limonyl acetate (27); and the acridone alkaloid 5-hydroxynoracronycine (atalaphyllidine, 21). Compounds 12, 22-24, and 27 were not previously found from the roots of the plant C. limonia developed from the germination of seeds. Limonyl acetate (27) has been found in fruits of the Citrus-Poncirus hybrid (25). The coumarins buntasin (22) and (E)-suberenol (23) are cited from the roots of hybrid C. paradise Macf. X C. tangerina Hort. Ex Tanaka (24) and (Z)-suberenol (24) from C. funadoko (26). The coumarins xanthyletin (7), xanthoxyletin (11), suberosin (15), crenulatin (16), and nordentatin (26) were previously isolated from the roots of C. limonia (23). Compounds Isolated from the Roots of C. limonia Devel- oped from the Germination of Seeds. The roots of C. limonia were also studied to gain a better understanding of whether the compounds obtained from the rootstock in grafts also occur in this organ of trees developed from the germination of seeds. During the concentration of the hexane extract, a crystalline material separated, which was collected and chromatographed on silica gel to afford xanthyletin (7), seselin (14), and the steroids sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol. The hexane and dichloromethane extracts were combined and puriﬁed by repeated column chromatography yielding again xanthyletin (7), seselin (14), and xanthoxyletin (11), clausarin (25), scopoletin (28), trans-kellactone (31), trans-decursidinol (32), and junos- marin (33); and the ﬂavonoids limonianin (18) and erythrisene- galone (20). The methanol extract afforded xanthyletin (7), isoscopoletin (29), 7-demethylsuberosin (30), trans-decursidinol (32), and xanthoarnol (34). Flavona 18 and the coumarin 7-demethylsuberosin (30) were previously isolated from the roots of C. limonia (23), while seselin (14), clausarin (25), scopoletin (28), isoscopoletin (29), trans-kellactone (31), trans-decursidinol (32), junosmarin (33), and xanthoarnol (34), and ﬂavanone erythrisenegalone (20) are reported here for the ﬁrst time from this organ. The coumarins 14, 25, 28, 29, and 31-33 have been found from the roots of the hybrid C. paradise Macf. X C. tangerina Hort. Ex Tanaka (24), and ﬂavanone erythrisenegalone (20) from several hybrid seedlings resulting from a cross of C. tamurana Hort. Ex. Takahashi and C. kinokuni Hort Ex. Tanaka (27). This appears to be the ﬁrst record of xanthoarnol (34) in Citrus, which occurs in rutaceous genus Zanthoxylum arnottianum (28). Comparison between the Chemical Proﬁles of Roots, Stems, and Leaves of C. sinensis Grafted on C. limonia. Roots, stems, and leaves of C. sinensis grafted on C. limonia produce a considerable number of compounds that are not common in both plants developed from the germination of seeds. These differences in the chemical proﬁle could be attributed to the inﬂuence of the graft on the biosyntheses of these com- pounds in all organs. However, different investigators seldom publish the developmental stage of the plant, making the above comparisons invalid. Thus, it is premature to draw any conclu- sions about the role of the graft on the absence or presence of new compounds in roots, stems, and leaves of C sinensis grafted on C. limonia, until plants developed from the germination of seeds with the same developmental stage can be evaluated. However, little is known about the chemistry of grafts to clarify the translocation of metabolites from the rootstock to the scion or the reasons why some compounds are only present in grafted plant. Our own investigations of the stem of Cedrela odorata grafted on Toona ciliata (Meliaceae) revealed the presence of some limonoids, which are common in the former developed from the germination of seeds and many others, which were not previously found from that (29). The results above, which suggest that the rootstock stem does not biosynthesize metabolites de noVo, remain obscure. The chemical proﬁle of the scion and rootstock differ notably in absence of ﬂavonoids and coumarins containing C5 prenyl groups attached to the carbon atoms of aromatic and heterocyclic systems or to oxygen, in the former. Only xanthyletin (7) and xanthoxyletin (11) were found in scion. This observation indicates that the prenylated compounds once biosynthesized in the roots could have been translocated to other organs. Xanthyletin (7) and xanthoxyletin (11) appear to be translocated to scion stems and leaves, while other prenylated coumarins and ﬂavonoids only to rootstock stem. Further experiments on the enzymatic formation of xanthyletin (7) and seselin (14) from dimethylallyl diphosphate using cell-free extract from leaves, roots, and stems in order to determine if secondary metabolites present in the roots of rootstock could be translocated into rootstock stem and to graft C. sinensis are in progress. Preliminary results showed that in the roots of C sinensis grafted on C. limonia the biosynthesis of xanthyletin (7) and seselin (14) is time-regulated and that prenyltransferase activity depends upon circadian variation. The cell-free extracts from scion leaves and stems were also similarly incubated with dimethylallyl diphosphate but did not give xanthyletin (7) and seselin (14), suggesting that the enzyme is not present in these organs. Effect of Some Sapindale Compounds on the Growth of Xylella fastidiosa. A number of ﬂavonoids, coumarins, and limonoids reported here, and alkaloids, dihydrocinnamic acid Compounds of Citrus sinensis on C. limonia J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 56, No. 17, 2008 7819 derivative, anacardic acid, triterpenes, and limonoids (Figure 4) isolated from other Rutaceae, Meliaceae, and Anacardiaceae (Sapindales) were tested for in Vitro activity on the growth of X. fastidiosa. The tested compounds rutaecarpin (35), N-methyl- 4-methoxyquinolin-2-one (36), 5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H- 1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (37), and guyanin (38) were isolated from Hortia brasiliana and H. oreadica; 3′,4′,5′,5,7- pentamethoxyﬂavanone (39), 3′,4′,7,8-tetramethoxy-5,6-(2′′,2′′- dimethylpyrano)-ﬂavone (43) from Neoraputia magniﬁca; 3-(1,1- dimethylallyl)-isoscopoletin (40), raunin (42), and gravelliferone methyl ether (41) from Rauia resinosa (Rutaceae); odoratol (46), odoratone (47), gedunin (48), and catechin (44) from Cedrela odorata grafted on Toona ciliata (29); azadirachtin A (49) from Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae); and anacardic acid (45) from Anacardiaceae. All compounds above were isolated in our own investigations of plants from Sapindales. The 9a5c strain was obtained from the petioles and stems of CVC-affected sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) plants (4 months) maintained in a protected greenhouse at Centro APTA Citros Sylvio Moreira, Instituto Agronoˆmico, Cordeiro´polis, SP, Brazil. The 9a5c strains evaluated were PCR positive for speciﬁc X. fastidiosa primers. The fact that stationary phase bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics than logarithmically growing cells has been known for some time (30). Thus, preliminary assays were performed on stationary phase cells of X. fastidiosa and with compounds obtained in great amount from Hortia brasiliana and H. oreadica (Rutaceae). Concentration of rutaecarpin (35) at 1.00 mg/mL or higher effectively inhibited X. fastidiosa cell prolif- eration, while N-methyl-4-methoxyquinolin-2-one (36), 5,7- dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-propanoic acid (37), and the limonoid guyanin (38) showed antibacterial activity only at 1.50 mg/mL. Then, the MICs were determined in dilutions from 1.60 to 0.70 mg/mL on stationary phase. The MICs were, in order of their decreasing activity, 2.9 × 103 µM for 38 and 4.2 × 103 µM for 35, 4.8 × 103 µM for 37, and 7.9 × 103 µM 36 (Table 1). The assays with X. fastidiosa after 5 days (exponential phase) and 10 days (stationary phase) of growth have been developed in order to compare in Vitro activity of some test compounds on both phases. Only xanthyletin (7), seselin (14), limonin (12), and 3′,4′,5′,5,7-pentamethoxyﬂavanone (39) were assayed on exponential and stationary phases, and the growth inhibition was very similar for both. This study demonstrated that X. fastidiosa was affected by tested compounds 7, 14, 12, and 39 at concentrations ranging from 1.00 to 2.00 mg/mL. In the case of coumarins 7 and 14, logarithmically growing cells (2.00 mg/ mL, complete growth inhibition) were found to be more resistant Figure 4. Compounds tested for in vitro activity on the growth of X. fastidiosa, which were not obtained in this work. Table 1. Inhibitory Effect of Compounds 7, 12, 14, and 35-39 on X. fastidiosa 9a5c Strain in Stationary Phase and Compounds 6 and 40-49 on Exponential Phase stationary phase exponential phase compounds MIC mg/mL (103 µM) MIC mg/mL (103 µM) 7 1.00(4.4) 12 1.60(3.4) 14 1.40(6.1) 35 1.00(4.2) 36 1.50(7.9) 37 1.40(4.8) 38 1.50(2.9) 39 1.40(3.7) 6 2.00(3.3) 40 >2.00(7.7) 41 >2.00(6.4) 42 1.50(5.5) 43 1.30(3.1) 44 1.00(3.4) 45 1.70(4.9) 46 1.80(3.8) 47 1.10(2.3) 48 1.30(2.7) 49 >1.60(2.2) 7820 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 56, No. 17, 2008 Ribeiro et al. than stationary phase cells (1.00 mg/mL, complete growth inhibition). One possible explanation for this resistance is that logarithmic phase bacteria have a more efﬁcient system for the detoxiﬁcation of foreign compounds within their cells. However, a more systematic analysis is necessary to clarify this resistance. In a recent study, Teitzel and Parsek (31) examined the relative effects of heavy metal copper and lead on stationary and logarithmic phase cells of Pseudomanas aeruginosa and also found that the latter were more resistant to metals. Moreover, the exponential phase may be helpful in the estimation of MICs, and it can reduce the time needed for bacterial growth; thus, the other compounds were assayed with X. fastidiosa after 5 days of growth. The results for exponential phase are summarized in Table 1. Triterpene derivatives were the most active, odoratone (47), gedunin (48), and azadiractin A (49) showed MICs of 2.3 × 103 µM, 2.7 × 103 µM, and >2.2 × 103 µM, respectively. The activities of limonoid limonin (12, 3.4 × 103 µM) and triterpene odoratol (46, 3.8 × 103 µM) were comparable to those of ﬂavonoids 3′,4′,7,8-tetramethoxy-5,6-(2′′,2′′-dimethylpyrano)- ﬂavone (43, 3.1 × 103 µM), catechin (44, 3.4 × 103 µM), and 3′,4′,5′,5,7-pentamethoxyﬂavanone (39, 3.7 × 103 µM). The cells of the mesophyll of the affected leaves with CVC also present a reduced number of chloroplasts associated with a larger concentration of hesperidin (6) crystals (32). Then, hesperidin (6), 7-rutinosyl-4′-methoxy-3′,5-dihydroxyﬂavanone, was assayed; however, it showed a moderate activity with MIC at 3.3 × 103 µM. This result suggests that hesperidin (6) acts as a good barrier for the growth of X. fastidiosa in small-size colonies. The coumarins xanthyletin (7, 4.4 × 103 µM), raunin (42, 5.5 × 103 µM), seselin (14, 6.1 × 103 µM), gravelliferone methyl ether (41, > 6.4 × 103 µM), 3-(1,1-dimethylallyl)- isoscopoletin (40, > 7.7 × 103 µM), and anacardic acid (45, 4.9 × 103 µM) showed no appreciable activity against X. fastidiosa (Table 1). Comparison of the Antimicrobial Activities of the Sap- indale Compounds with Those from the Literature. The biological assay results indicated that the compounds tested in Vitro against the X. fastidiosa 9a5c strain were active at concentrations in the 1.00 mg/mL range, while the antibiotics ampicillin (10 µg/mL), kanamycin (2 µg/mL), neomycin (5 µg/ mL), penicillin (50 µg/mL), streptomycin (10 µg/mL), and tetracycline (1 µg/mL) were active in the concentrations lower than 50 µg/mL under the agar disk diffusion and MIC methods (33). However, this work did not evaluate the bacterium in Bioﬁlm or in higher density growth; moreover, antibiotics are not utilized in agriculture to treat plants with diseases because of the environmental and economic impact. A second class of organic compounds evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against X. fastidiosa (PD00-2 isolated from grapevine with Pierce’s disease) was lytic peptides. Peptides cecropin A and B totally inhibited the cell growth of X. fastidiosa at a concentration of 0.5 µM (34). However, other studies determined cecropin B activity against different sized aggregation of X. fastidiosa and demonstrated that this peptide at 10 µM was not efﬁcient to kill large-size colonies from this bacterium. The authors suggested that aggregation of X. fastidiosa cells may serve as a mechanism of protection against cecropin B (35). In the present work, the tested compounds showed weak activity ranging from 2.2 × 103 µM to 7.9 × 103 µM; however, we utilized cells in higher density and in aggregated form (Bioﬁlm cells), which could reﬂect what occurs in plants with CVC, and the aggregation of bacteria may serve as a mechanism of protection against bactericides. Thus, if it is assumed that the MICs obtained in this condition suggest continued investigation, clearly the limonoid azadirachtin A (49, MIC 2.2 × 103 µM) and the ﬂavanone hesperidin (6, 3.3 × 103 µM) need further investigation as potential bactericidal agents. Hesperidin (6) is most probably involved as a natural defense or in resistance mechanisms against X. fastidiosa in sweet orange varieties (32). Thus, it can be efﬁcient to kill small-size colonies from X. fastidiosa and could be used as a preventive of disease. It has long been recognized that orange peel represents a promising source of hesperidin. A million metric tons of peel residues are generated as result of fruit processing, and thus, an extract of this residue could be considered for practical use to prevent and control CVC. Azadirachtin A (49) occurs only in the Neem tree Azadirachta indica A. Juss. Oil from the seeds of A. indica contain a mixture of seven isomeric compounds labeled azadirachtin-A to azadirach- tin-G, with the former being present in the highest quantity. This cocktail of compounds signiﬁcantly reduces the chances of toler- ance or resistance developing in any of the affected organisms. In addition, they have signiﬁcant effect on pests without harming beneﬁcial organisms. Toxicology studies have indicated them to be quite safe to mammals (36). Emulsiﬁed neem oil (5%) was bactericidal against green pepper bacterial leaf spot incited by economically important phytopathogenic Xanthomonas campestris pv Vesicatoria (36). These data stimulated an investigation of neem oil as a X. fastidiosa inhibitor. Experiments on the dose response of X. fastidiosa Bioﬁlm to hesperidin and neem oil in Vitro and in plant are in progress.
