1 RESUMO: “Atividade tripanocida de flavonoides e limonoides isolados de extratos ativos  de plantas de Myrsinaceae e Meliaceae”. A atividade de extratos brutos de três espécies de  Rapanea (Myrsinaceae) e de Cipadessa fruticosa (Meliaceae) foi avaliada in vitro contra formas  tripomastigotas de Trypanosoma cruzi. Foram obtidos 33 extratos de diferentes órgãos das espécies  estudadas, sendo que onze deles apresentaram atividades significantes (% de lise > 50) nos ensaios  realizados. O fracionamento de um extrato ativo dos galhos de R. lancifolia (99,5%) resultou  no isolamento de dois flavonoides (quercetina e taxifolina), que apresentaram baixa atividade  tripanocida. De um extrato ativo dos frutos de C. fruticosa (97,7%) foram isolados os limonoides  mexicanolídeos cipadesina, mexicanolídeo, febrifugina e cipadesina A, que foram moderadamente  ativos sobre T. cruzi. Além disso, outros dois flavonoides (flavona e 7-metoxiflavona), previamente  ensaiados contra T. cruzi, foram isolados do extrato hexânico dos galhos de C. fruticosa (100%).  Os resultados obtidos aqui sugerem que as plantas avaliadas podem constituir fontes de novas  substâncias ativas sobre o T. cruzi.  Unitermos: Myrsinaceae, Meliaceae, atividade tripanocida, flavonoides, limonoides. ABSTRACT: The activity of crude extracts of three Rapanea species (Myrsinaceae) and Cipadessa  fruticosa (Meliaceae) was evaluated in vitro against the trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma  cruzi. Thirty-three extracts from different organs of these species were assayed and eleven of them  showed significant activity (lysis % >50). The fractionation of an active extract from branches of R.  lancifolia (99.5%) led to the isolation of two flavonoids: quercetin and taxifolin, which have weak  trypanocidal activity. Additionally, one active extract from fruits of C. fruticosa (97.7%) afforded  mexicanolide limonoids: cipadesin, mexicanolide, febrifugin and cipadesin A, that were slightly  active on T. cruzi. Moreover, other two flavonoids (flavone and 7-methoxyflavone), previously  assayed against T. cruzi, were isolated from the hexane extract from branches of C. fruticosa  (100%). The results presented here suggest that the plants evaluated could be a source of new active  compounds against T. cruzi.

It is caused by a flagellate  protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted to  humans by blood-sucking triatomine insects and by blood  transfusion (WHO, 1997). With the control of the insect  vector (Triatoma infestans), infected blood transfusion is  becoming the major cause for the spread of the disease  (Dias, 1993). The only trypanocidal substance currently  used to prevent the infection by this route is gentian violet,  but its use is limited due to undesirable effects on the  patients (Dias, 1993). The treatment of Chagas’ disease  is still a challenge, since the only current available drug  (benznidazole) has strong side effects (de Castro, 1993).  Thus, the search for more efficient and less toxic drugs is  needed to control this disease.   In the past years, the study of compounds isolated  from plants has received considerable attention in the  search for alternative chemotherapy of parasitic diseases  (Serrano et al., 2000) and many natural compounds have  been identified as trypanocides (Duschak & Couto, 2007;  2 Guimarães & Faria, 2007). Several extracts from plants  of Meliaceae and Rutaceae families have been showed in  vitro activity against T. cruzi (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira  et al., 2001; Ambrozin et al., 2004; de Mesquita et al.,  2005). Therefore, natural products constitute a promising  source of new active compounds for treatment of Chagas’  disease.    In this paper, we report the results of the evaluation  of in vitro trypanocidal activity of 33 crude extracts from  different organs of Rapanea lancifolia, R. guianensis,  R. umbelata Myrsinaceae, and Cipadessa fruticosa  Meliaceae. Moreover, it is showed the trypanocidal activity  of flavonoids isolated from hexane extracts from branches  of R. lancifolia and C. fruticosa, as well the activity of four  limonoids isolated from dichloromethane extract from  fruits of C. fruticosa. MATERIAL AND METHODS Plant material    Plants were collected in different states of Brazil  and identified by Dr. Maria Inês Salgueiro Lima from  Department of Botany, UFSCar, SP and Dr. José Rubens  Pirani from Department of Botany, USP, SP (Table 1).

Fernandes, Paulo C. Vieira, Maria F. das G. F. da Silva et al. giving four fractions. Fraction 4 was fractionated in the  same conditions to yield compounds 1 (3.2 mg) and 2 (3.7  mg).    The hexane extract (12.2 g) from branches of C.  fruticosa (fresh weight: 1524 g) was submitted to vacuum  liquid chromatography over silica gel using a hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient. The ethyl acetate fraction  (6.8 g) was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with  hexane-CH2Cl2-acetone gradient to give nine fractions.  Fraction 3 was fractionated as above, using hexane- CH2Cl2-acetone (6:3:1), affording nine fractions. Fraction  5 was three times chromatographed through column  chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane-CH2Cl2- MeOH (7:2.5:0.5) to afford compounds 7 (16.7 mg) and 8  (8.2 mg).    The dichloromethane extract from fruits (15.0  g) of C. fruticosa (fresh weight: 180 g), was submitted  to vacuum liquid chromatography over silica gel using a  hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient, resulting in the  fractions: hexane-CH2Cl2 (1:1); CH2Cl2; CH2Cl2/AcOEt  (1:1); EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1). Fractions CH2Cl2/ AcOEt (1:1) and EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) were studied, as  following described: the fraction CH2Cl2/AcOEt (1:1) (5.0  g) was again submitted to vacuum liquid chromatography on  silica gel using a gradient elution (hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc,  and MeOH), resulting in the four corresponding soluble  fractions. The ethyl acetate fraction (2.3 g) obtained from  the last fractionation was several times chromatographed  on silica gel and finally submitted to preparative HPLC to  afford for limonoids 3 (19.4 mg), 5 (8.1 mg), and 6 (8.5  mg). Limonoid 4 (48.9 mg) was isolated from fraction  EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) (4.6 g) of extract through several  chromatographies on silica gel.   Compounds 1-6 were identified through 1H and  13C NMR spectra, 1H - 1H COSY, HSQC and HMBC  experiments and MS. The spectral data of 1 and 2 were in  agreement with those published in the literature (Kuo et al.,  1998; Moon et al., 2001) as well as the data of limonoids  3 (Luo et al., 2000), 4 (Paula, 1996), 5 (Govindachari &  Kumari, 1998) and 6 (Leite et al. 2005a). Additionally,  compounds 7 and 8 were characterized by comparison of  13C NMR data with the literature (Kingsburry & Looker,  1975). The in vitro activity on T. cruzi of compounds 3  - 6 is described herein. On the other hand, the activities  of compounds 1, 2, 7 and 8 were previously reported  (Ambrozin et al., 2004; Tasdemir et al., 2006). Bioassay   The bioassays were carried out according to  the procedures described by Ambrozin et al. (2008). The  activity of crude extracts was evaluated in triplicate at  4 mg/mL and pure substances at 250, 100, and 50 µg/ mL. It is expressed as percent reduction of the parasite  number (lysis) and IC50 (µmol/L) for compounds 3-6 were  calculated using the program GraphPad Prims v.3.0.

The solvent was  removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation and  the extracts obtained were assayed against T. cruzi.   The hexane extract (9.3 g) from branches of R.  lancifolia (fresh weight: 1870 g) was fractionated through  column chromatography on silica gel affording hexane,  dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol fractions.  The methanol fraction (1.5 g) was chromatographed on  silica gel using hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient,  3 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn.  Braz. J. Pharmacogn.  20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010  Trypanocidal activity of flavonoids and limonoids isolated from Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae active plant extracts RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   In this work, we assessed the trypanocidal  activity of 33 extracts of three Myrsinaceae and one  Meliaceae species (Table 2). Eleven of them (33%)  showed significant activity (lysis % > 50) at 4 mg/mL  against the trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. The majority  of the extracts of C. fruticosa presented relevant activity.  The best result was obtained from the hexane extract from  branches of C. fruticosa (CFBH) that reduced 100% of  the parasite number. The majority of the extracts of the  three Rapanea species assayed did not present significant  results, since several extracts led to the total lysis of the  parasites and the red blood cells, as well. However, some  extracts of these species showed high trypanocidal activity  without affecting the red blood cells, such as the hexane  extract from branches of R. lancifolia (RLBH).   Similar studies involving the trypanocidal activity  of Meliaceae and Rutaceae species have been reported  by our group (Mafezoli et al., 2000; Vieira et al., 2001;  Ambrozin et al., 2004, 2005a, 2008) showing that these  plants can be considered a promising source of active  compounds against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi.  Thus, the significant results obtained from the extracts of  C. fruticosa are consistent with those previously reported  for this family.    The investigation of the methanol fraction of  the active hexane extract from branches of R. lancifolia  (RLBH) led to the isolation of the flavonol quercetin (1)  Plant Plant part Solvent extraction Crude extract Lysis % Rapanea lancifolia  (Myrsinaceae) hexane RLFLH 76.8 flowers dichloromethane RLFLD 72.2 methanol RLFLM TLa hexane RLLH TLa leaves dichloromethane RLLD TLa methanol RLLM TLa hexane RLBH 99.5 branches dichloromethane RLBD 7.0 methanol RLBM 47.69 hexane RGFLH TLa flowers dichloromethane RGFLD TLa methanol RGFLM TLa Rapanea guianensis  (Myrsinaceae) hexane RGLH TLa leaves dichloromethane RGLD TLa methanol RGLM 68.5 hexane RGBH TLa branches dichloromethane RGBD TLa methanol RGBM 6.94 Hexane RUFRH TLa fruits dichloromethane RUFRD 69.4 Rapanea umbellata  (Myrsinaceae) methanol RUFRM TLa hexane RURH TLa roots dichloromethane RURD TLa methanol RURM TLa hexane CFFRH 95.5 fruits dichloromethane CFFRD 97.7 methanol CFFRM 60.6 Cipadessa fruticosa  (Meliaceae) Hexane CFLH 33.7 leaves dichloromethane CFLD 92.8 methanol CFLM 40.2 hexane CFBH 100 branches dichloromethane CFBD 76.1 methanol CFBM 42.0 Table 2.

F. da Silva et al. and the dihydrofl avonol taxifolin (2). Several biological activities have been reported for these fl avonoids. Quercetin  (1), for example, presented antiprotozoal effect against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 = 14 µM), Trypanosoma brucei  brucei (IC50 = 13.2 µM), Leishmania donovani (IC50 = 63.8 µM) (Camacho et al., 2002), T. brucei and T. rhodesiense  (Williamson & Finnigan, 1978). In addition, this compound was described as a constituent of an aqueous extract  from Lychnophora pinaster, Asteraceae which showed trypanocidal activity (Silveira et al., 2005). Recently, high  leishmanicidal activity was described for such compound (Tasdemir et al., 2006). Compounds 1 and 2 were previously  assayed on trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, but showed low activity (Tasdemir et al., 2006). The relevant activity of the  original extract (RLBH) is probably associated with the presence of other compounds or mixture of them.   The mexicanolide limonoids 3-6, isolated from  fruits of C. fruticosa, showed signifi cant trypanocidal  activity (Table 3). They were obtained from the very  active dichloromethane extract of fruits (Table 2, CFFRD,  97.7 %). This extract also afforded other limonoids  (Leite et al., 2005a,b), which were not assayed herein.  Recently, we reported the inhibitory activity of crude  extracts of Meliaceae and Rutaceae plants on glycosomal  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH)  enzyme from T. cruzi. The results showed that crude  extracts from C. fruticosa showed high ability to inhibit  the enzyme activity (Leite et al., 2009). Thus, this  specie could be considered as a promising source of  lead compounds against Chagas’ disease. In addition,  the extracts from C. fruticosa showed high inhibition of  adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), a key enzyme  from Leishmania that has been proposed as a target for the  rational search of new leishmanicidal drugs (Ambrozin et  al., 2005b).    5 Rev. Bras. Farmacogn.  Braz. J. Pharmacogn.  20(1): Jan./Mar. 2010  Trypanocidal activity of flavonoids and limonoids isolated from Myrsinaceae and Meliaceae active plant extracts   The trypanocidal activity of flavone (7) and  7-methoxyflavone (8), isolated from the active hexane  extract from branches of C. fruticosa (CFBH), was  previously published by Ambrozin et al. (2004). They  showed that these flavonoids, isolated from an active  fraction of Conchocarpus heterophyllus (Rutaceae),  presented low activity against trypomastigote forms  of T. cruzi (IC50 = 2116 and 787 µg/mL or 9531 and  1084 µmol/L, respectively) when compared with other  flavonoids (Ribeiro et al., 1997; Ambrozin et al., 2004).  Probably, the relevant activity obtained from the extract  CFBH can be related to other characteristic metabolites  of C. fruticosa. As limonoids in the present work showed  trypanocidal activity, we believe that the activity of CFBH  extract may be associated with these compounds.  Table 3.

The phytochemical study of three  active extracts of R. lancifolia and C. fruticosa led to the  isolation of quercetin (1), taxifolin (2), flavone (7) and  7-methoxyflavone (8), which had showed weak activity  against the trypomatigote forms of T. cruzi, and cipadesin  (3), febrigufin (4), mexicanolide (5), and cipadesin A (6)  that were appreciably actives. In addition, the trypanocidal  activity of plants of Myrsinaceae family and limonoids 3-6  are been disclosed for the first time.
