[Traduit par le journal]  Erythrina mulungu3 (Leguminosae) is a medicinal  plant used in folk medicine as a nervine sedative,  MeO  febrifuge, and antiasthmatic (1). These pharmaco-  logical activities are very similar to those shown by  % 8   -  I  E. uariegata (2) and seem to be due to the presence  Me0 \  Me0  l4  4  -  I  of spiroamine alkaloids.

Compound 4 was isolated as an oily brown  substance of molecular formula Cl9HZ3NO4 (Mf  329.1595) as determined by high resolution mass  spectrometry. The ir (v,,,  1610cm-l) and the uv  spectra (I.,,,  23 1 (14 000) and 278 (2900) nm) were  almost identical with those of erysotrine 1 (9) and  erythrartine 2 (10). The mass spectrum showed  significant ions at rnle 329 (Mf), 313 (Mf - 16), 298  (Mf - 16 - 15), 282 (Mf - 16 - 31), 269,239 (100),  165, 152.  Based on these data an erythrinan carbon skeleton  of the 1-6 diene type was assumed. The 'H  nmr spectrum of 4, in deuteriochloroform, revealed  two aromatic proton singlets at 6 6.83, 6.76 and  three methoxyl group singlets at 6 3.43 (3H), 3.84  (3H), and 3.95 (3H). The presence of three olefinic  proton signals at 6 5.92 (broad singlet, H-7), 6 6.30  (broad doublet, J = 10 Hz, H- 1), and 6 6.86 (d, J =  3Hz, low field arm of a double doublet partially  covered by one of the aromatic singlets, H-2)  corroborated the assumption of a diene system in  the molecule. On irradiation at 6 4.10 (H-3) the  double doublet at 6 2.14 (H-4e, J3e-4e  = 5.5Hz;  J4+ = 11 HZ) collapsed to a doublet, the large  multiplet at 6 3.08-3.36 (3 superimposed proton  signals) was simplified, and the low field arm of the  H-2 signal collapsed to a singlet. Further irradiation  at 6 3.20 (H-4a) and 6 2.14 (H-4e) allowed the  assignment of this ABXY system to that depicted in  ring A of 4.  These results were comparable with those of  erythristemine 12 (7) and erythrartine 2 (10) except  for the H-4a chemical shift (A64-12 1.12, A64-2  1.35 ppm). Further analysis of the 'H nmr spectrum  was not possible due to superimposed signals.  The clue to the structure elucidation of 4 was  given by the analysis of the 13C nmr spectrum. The  main differences between compound 4 and 1 in the  13C nmr spectra lie in the chemical shifts of the  carbon atoms neighboring N. The shielding (861-4  9.4, 3.5, and 3.6ppm at C-4, C-7, and C-12 respec-  tively) and deshielding (h6Ip4 14.7, 15.1, and 15.9  ppm at C-5, C-8, and C-10 respectively) effects are  consistent with those observed for fumaritine 10  and fumaritine-N-oxide 11 (14).  The above arguments, and the presence of an (M  - 16)+ peak in the mass spectrum (characteristic of  N-oxides (15)), led us to suggest the erysotrine-N-  Can. J. Chem.

Further confirma-  tion of structure 4 was accomplished by treating 1  with m-chloroperbenzoic acid. The resulting N-  oxide was identical in all aspects (ir, lH nmr) to the  natural product 4.  Compound 5 was isolated as an oil of molecular  formula C19H,,N0, (M+ 345.1602) as determined  by high resolution mass spectrometry. This com-  pound exhibited the uv (A,,,  278 (2900), 231  (14000) nm) and ir (v,,,  1610, 3250 (OH) cm-l)  absorption bands attributable to the 1-6 diene  moiety and an hydroxyl group respectively. The 'H  nmr spectrum (deuteriochloroform) showed the  presence of the following functional groups: three  methoxyl groups (6 3.38, 3.78, and 3.92, each 3H,  s), two aromatic protons (6 6.68 and 7.08, each lH,  s), and three methines (6 5.82 (broad singlet, lH),  6.18(d, J = lOHz), and 6.74(dd, J = 10and ~ H z ) ) ,   the latter characteristic of a 1-6 diene erythrinan  skeleton.  On irradiation at 6 2.09 (dd, J3a-4e  = 5 HZ, J4e-4a  = 10.5Hz), the triplet at 6 3.16 (J4a-4e = 10.5Hz,  J3a-4a  = 10.5 HZ) collapsed to a doublet. Conversely,  irradiation of the triplet at 6 3.16 changed the  double doublet at 6 2.09 to a doublet. In compound  5, as in erysotrine-N-oxide, H-4a (part of the ABX  system of ring A) is shifted downfield (A6 1.3 1 ppm)  when compared to that of erythrartine 2. This  supports an N-oxide structure. Finally, the exist-  ence of a carbinolic proton at C-1 1 was suggested,  based on the signal at 6 5.28 (d, Jloa-lla  = 15 Hz,  H-1 la).  The 13C nmr spectrum of 5 (Table 1) when  compared to that of 2 revealed deshieldings  15.2, 15.9, and 14.7ppm at C-10, C-5, and C-8  respectively) and shieldings (Atj2-5 9.5, 4.5, and  2.2ppm at C-4, C-7, and C-12 respectively) analo-  gous to those observed in the transformation of  erysotrine 1 into erysotrine-N-oxide 4. Based on  these arguments, we assumed compound 5 was  erythrartine-N-oxide. Confirmation was obtained  by treating erythrartine with m-chloroperbenzoic  acid. The resultant synthetic N-oxide and the  natural product 5 showed superimposable ir and 'H  nmr spectra.  The absolute configuration at C-3 and C-11 of 5  was established as follows. Methylation of the oily  N-oxide 5 with sodium hydride - methyl iodide  afforded the 0-methyl derivative 13, whose 'H nmr  spectrum analysis revealed the presence of an  additional methoxyl group at 6 3.64. As observed in  4 and 5, the ABX system of ring A appears at 6 2.00  (dd, Jk-& = 11 HZ, J4e-3a  = 5.5 Hz, H-4e), 3.34 (t,  J4e-4a  = 11 HZ, J4a-3a  = 11 HZ, H-4a). The INDOR  technique was used to identify H-3. Using the  central peak of the triplet at 6 3.34 as the observed  transition, responses were obtained at 6 2.00 and 6  4.30. Consequently H-3 must be at 6 4.30. Using the  INDOR technique and observing the peak at 6 5.80  (broad s, H-7), Hga and H8, were detected at 6 4.20.  Finally, observing each line of the doublet at 6 5.16  (d, J = 15 Hz, H-11), responses were obtained at 6  4.40. Thus, from 6 4.60 to 6 4.10 are located signals  corresponding to Hloa, Hloe, H3, H8a, Hge. Finally  the large coupling (J = 15 Hz) of the carbinolic  proton was indicative of an axial proton at H-1  The analysis of the I3C nmr spectrum of 13 was also  carried out. The comparison of the 6 values for 13  with the 6 values for 5 revealed the concordance of  all carbon shifts except for C-10, C-1 1, and C- 13,  where the methylation occurred. Furthermore, the  C- 11 and C-3 shifts (74.4 and 75.3 ppm respectively)  suggested equatorial methoxyl groups at both car-  bons, thus corroborating the pseudo axial H-11.  Treatment of 13 with triethylphosphite in ben-  zene produced the tertiary base erythristemine 12,  which showed [a]D and 'H nmr data analogous to  that reported in the literature (7). The absolute con-  figurations at C-11 and C-3 of 12 were determined  by a crystallographic study. This indicates that  indeed 5 and 12 have the same absolute configura-  tions at C-3 and C- 11.  This is the first time erythrinan N-oxides have  been reported. The possibility that these N-oxides  might be artefacts could not be ignored. Therefore  fresh flowers were collected and extracted with  cold methanol and the crude extract was immedi-  ately analyzed by thin layer chromatography. The  presence of the N-oxides showed that in fact they  are natural products. The water solubility of the  N-oxides and the current methods for isolation of  water soluble alkaloids are probably responsible  for the lack of examples of erythrinan-N-oxides in  the literature.  Interestingly, N-oxidation of each of the alka-  loids erysotrine 1 and erythrartine 2 yielded only  one of the two possible (considering inversion at  the bridgehead nitrogen (16)) N-oxides. In fact the  N-oxides 4 and 5 are those produced by intro-  duction of oxygen from the more accessible convex  face of the molecules 1 and 2, and this can be shown  in the 13C nmr by the C-4 shielding (A6 - 9.5ppm)  and in the 'H nmr by the H-4a deshielding (A6 -  1.30ppm) effects produced when N-oxidation of  the tertiary bases occurs, similar to those observed  when going from 10 to 11 (14).  4Erythristemine 12 and compound 13 possess the same  absolute configuration at C-11 but their solution conformations  are different (H-11 is equatorial in 12 and axial in 13).

The I3C nmr spectra were recorded in CDCI, solutions on a  Varian XL-100 spectrometer operating at 25.2MHz in the  Fourier transform mode; the values are in parts per million  downfield from Me4Si (S(Me4Si) = S(CDC1,) + 76.9); low  resolution mass spectra were obtained with a Finnigan Model  10151SL spectrometer; optical rotations were measured in a  Carl Zeiss photoelectric polarimeter. All melting points were  determined on a Reichert hot-stage microscope and are uncor-  rected. Infrared spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer 337  spectrophotometer using thin films or KBr pellets. Merck silica  gel HF was utilized for thin layer plates (tlc) and spots were  visualized by spraying Dragendorff solution (17) followed by  MeOH/H2S04 and heating at 110Â°C.

The residue was  purified by preparative layer chromatography, developed with  CHC1,-MeOH 1:1, affording 40.0mg (32% yield); lH nmr 6:  6.87 (s, H), 6.78 (s, H), 6.66 (d, J2-3 = 2 Hz, high field arm of a  dd, H-2), 6.20(d, J1-2= lOHz, H-1), 5.80(broad s, H-7), 5.16 (d,  Jlla-loa = 15 Hz, H-11), 4.60-4.10(m, H-lOa, H-lOe, H-3, H-8a,  H-8e), 3.95 (s, OMe), 3.81 (s, OMe), 3.64 (s, OMe), 3.40 (s,  OMe), 3.34 (t, J = 11 Hz, H-4a), 2.00 (dd, J4&-&  = 11 HZ, J4e-3a  = 5.5Hz, H-4e). The 13C nmr data for 13 are listed in Table 1.  Erythristemine 12  0-Methyl-erythrartine-N-oxide 13 (0,04Og, 1.1 x  mol)  and 0.025 mL of triethylphosphite in benzene (5 mL) were heated  under reflux for one hour. The reaction mixture was then  evaporated and the residue purified by preparative layer chro-  matography, yielding 0.030g of erythristemine (78.9%); [aIDzs  192 (c 0.8, CHCI,) (lit.
