STEFANI  Departamento de Qubnica, Universidade Federal de Minaa Gerais, Be10 Horixonte, Brasil  (J?ec&uj 5 July 1969)  AWrsct-2-Hydroxyxanthone,  1,7-dihydroxyxan&me,  1 -hydroxy-7-methoxyxanthow,  2-hydroxy-1 -methA  oxyxanthme,  l&ncthykncdioxyxanth~e  and 2,8dihydroxy-l-methoxyxanthone  were isolated from the  wood of Kieimeyera exceka Camb.  THE WOOD of Kiehneyeca excelsa Camb. was found to contain 2-hydroxyxanthone,  1,7-  dihydroxyxanthone  (euxanthone),  1-hydroxy-7-methoxyxanthone,  2-hydroxy-l-methoxy-  xanthone and 2,8dihydroxy-1-methoxyxanthone.  All these compounds had already been  isolated previously from other species of the same genus2 and were identified by direct  comparison with authentic samples. Only one constituent proved to be a new natural  compound.  The molecular weight, determined by mass spectrometry, fitted a methylene-  dioxyxanthone  structure.  Resides the molecular ion peak, this spectrum contained only  one more intense peak at M-l mass units. The ease with which the molecule loses a hydrogen  atom was also indicative of a methylenedioxy-benzene  system which aromatizes upon  electron impact.  Of the three possible methylenedioxyxanthones,  only the 1,2derivative  was given consideration, in view of its probable biosynthetic relationship to 2-hydroxy-l-  methoxyxanthone.  Indeed, treatment of the natural isolate with PC& and hydrolysis of the  reaction product 3 yielded 1,2-dihydroxyxanthone.  1,2-Methylenedioxyxanthone,  which has been synthesixed,4 is the fourth natural methy-  lenedioxyxanthone  to be reported.  Other representatives  of this relatively small group  include 4-hydroxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone,  4-methoxy-2,3-methylenedioxyxanthone  5  and 1,2,4-trimethoxy-6,7-methylenedioxyxanthone.6  1,2-Oxygenation of a xanthone ring is not common among Kieimeyera constituents.  Up to now, the only principal metabolites to be characterized  by this structural feature  were found to occur in K. petiolaris (Spr.) Mart.’ Within the Guttiferae family, K. exceisa  and K. petiolaris form a pair of vicarious species,* stemming from a common ancestor, but  thriving presently in contiguous, but different ecological environment.

The similarity in oxygenation pattern of the xanth-  onic constituents of these species is, consequently, paralleled by their morphological and  phylogenetic a@nity.

The powdered wood (12 kg) wascontinuouslyextracted  with hot benxene.  Removal of the benxene gave a residue (475 g) which was taken up with a small volume of benxene.  An  insoluble crystalline~mass (2.1 g) which appeared was separated by filtration from.the benxene solution and  chromatographed  on silica (50 g) giving various fractions with the indicated solvents:  benxene (A,), benzene-  CHQ, 2: 1 (AI), benzene-CHCl,, 1: 2 (AS). The benzene solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue  (45.0 g) was chromatographed  on silica (900 g) giving various fraction with the indicated solvents:  benzene  (Bl), CHCll and CHCl&IeOH,  99: 1 (BI), CHCI,-MeGH,  99:2 (B,, B,, B5 in this order).
