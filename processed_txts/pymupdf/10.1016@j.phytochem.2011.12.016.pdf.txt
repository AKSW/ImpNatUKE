The dichloromethane extract from stems of H. oreadica also afforded two limonoids 9,11-dehydro- 12a-hydroxyhortiolide A and 6-hydroxyhortiolide C. As a result of this study and literature data, Hortia has been shown to produce highly specialized limonoids that are similar to those from the Flindersia (Flindersioideae). The taxonomy of Hortia has been debatable, with most authors placing it in the Toddalioideae. Considering the complexity of the isolated limonoids, Hortia does not show any close afﬁnity to the genera of Toddalioideae. That is, the limonoids appear to be of little value in resolving the taxonomic situation of Hortia. � 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Hortia is a Neotropical genus of the Rutaceae, traditionally included in the subfamily Toddalioideae, subtribe Toddaliinae (Engler, 1931). Hortia species are found from Panama to the state of São Paulo, Brazil, with most of the species occurring in the Ama- zonian region. Historically, De Candolle (De Candolle, 1824) described Hortia brasiliana Vand., which was collected in the south- eastern part of the state of Minas Gerais and in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and Saint-Hilaire (Saint-Hilaire, 1824) described a shrub collected in Goiás and in western Minas Gerais, and also named it H. brasiliana. Engler (1874) also attributed the name H. brasiliana to the shrubby species of central Brazil. In the same study, he described a new arborescent species, Hortia arborea Engl. Recently, Groppo et al. (2005) showed that H. brasiliana and H. arborea represent the same arborescent species, and that H. brasiliana Vand. ex DC. is the correct name. Albeit well known, the shrubby species found in central Brazil remained unnamed, so Groppo et al. (2005) called it Hortia oreadica Groppo, Kallunki and Pirani. Our taxonomic interest in the Rutaceae motivated an investigation of the taproots and stems of H. oreadica, whose ex- tracts afforded eight new limonoids (1–8, Fig. 1), in addition to the known guyanin (9). A search for previous phytochemical stud- ies of Hortia species indicated that only three limonoids (Fig. 1) have been previously reported from the genus, namely guyanin (9) (Jacobs and Ramdayal, 1986), hortiolide A (10) and B (11) (Suárez et al., 1998, 2002). 2. Results and discussion Compound 1 showed spectroscopic characteristics close to those of hortiolide A (10) (C27H32O7). HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C27H30O8 for compound 1, requiring the presence of additional oxygen in comparison with 10. The main changes observed in the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 1 were the presence of additional signals of a hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom (d 4.25, d, J = 6.8 Hz) and of an oleﬁnic hydrogen (d 6.20, d, J = 6.8 Hz). This oxymethine hydrogen (d 4.25) was coupled to the oleﬁnic hydrogen at d 6.20, and showed a one-bond correlation with the 13C NMR signal at d 66.0 (HSQC) and long-range correlation with the C-14 (d 167.3), C-17 (d 79.8) resonances and 13C NMR signals at d 153.3 and 120.7 (HMBC), indi- cating the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-12 and a double bond between C-9 (d 153.3) and C-11 (d 120.7). In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for 10. In addition, the NOE of the H-12 (d 4.25) coming from H-17 (d 4.91) suggested a spatial proximity of H-17b to H-12, which re- quires the hydroxyl group at C-12 to be anti (a) to H-17 (b). The structure of the new natural product 1 was thus established as 9,11-dehydro-12a-hydroxyhortiolide A. Its structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) with that of hortiolide A (10) (Suárez et al., 2002). 0031-9422/$ - see front matter � 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Phytochemistry 76 (2012) 52–59 Contents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirect Phytochemistry journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/phytochem Compound 2 exhibited similar NMR spectra to 1 (Tables 1 and 2) except for the presence of a secondary acetoxyl group (13C NMR signals d 169.4, 20.8, 1H NMR signal OCOMe d 2.02). A signif- icant downﬁeld shift for H-12 (d 5.28), when compared with 1, determined the position of the acetoxyl at C-12. The 1H NMR res- onance at d 5.28 and a methyl 1H NMR signal at d 2.02 showed long-range correlation with the 13C NMR resonances at d 169.4 (HMBC), conﬁrming an acetoxyl group at C-12. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for 1. Thus, the structure of the new limonoid was characterized as 9,11-dehydro-12a-acetoxyhortiolide A (2). The structure of compound 3 is more complex than those of 1 and 2. The NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) and extensive analysis of 2D NMR spectra conﬁrmed the hortiolide-type (10, 11) frame- work for 3. One of the changes observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra was the replacement of the resonances for an a,b-unsatu- rated d-lactone D-ring by signals for a 15-hydroxy-d-lactone. The 1H NMR signal for H-15 at d 4.40 (d, J = 1.8 Hz) showed one-bond correlation with the 13C NMR resonance at d 64.1 (HSCQ) and H- 15 was coupled only to the hydrogen of a hydroxyl group (d 3.03, d, J = 1.8 Hz). Moreover, the existence of correlations between the 1H NMR signal for H-15 and the 13C NMR resonances at d 45.5 (qua- ternary), 48.2 (quaternary), and 171.5 led to their assignments as C-13, C-14 and C-16, respectively. The COSY experiments showed correlation of the signals for H-11a and H-11b only with the resonances for H-12a and H-12b. The 1H NMR signals for H-11a and H-11b showed a long-range correlations with the 13C NMR resonances of C-10 (d 47.6, quaternary) and C-14 (d 48.2, quater- nary). The methyl 1H NMR signal at d 1.42, assigned to Me-19, showed cross-peaks with the 13C NMR signals for C-1, C-5, C-10 and at d 46.8 (quaternary), allowing the assignment of the resonance at d 46.8 to C-9, since it was the only carbon left in the skeleton for a 3J correlation. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) for 3 exhibited resonances in close agreement with those for the corresponding carbons in hortiolide A (10) (Suárez et al., 1998, 2002). However, the quaternary carbons C-9 and C-14 could not be explained by the presence of a normal C-ring as in hortiolide A (10). The formation of a cyclopronane ring involving C-9, C-8 and C-14 in a 9,11-dehydrohortiolide A precursor may have oc- curred, resulting in a hortiolide-A-bicyclo-[511–14.18.09,14]-hexane system, whose spectroscopic properties were in accord with the above data. HREIMS showed the molecular formula C27H32O8 and conﬁrmed the structure 3 for this compound. The relative stereochemistry of compound 3 was determined from g-NOESY experiments. The NOEs of the H-5 (d 2.52) and H- 17 (d 5.35) coming from H-15 (d 4.40) suggested a spatial proxim- ity of H-5b and H-17b to H-15, which requires the hydroxyl group at C-15 to be anti (a) to H-5 and H-17. In the same way, the NOEs of the H3-19 (d 1.42) and H3-18 (d 1.18) coming from H3-30 (d 1.87), required the Me-30 to be syn (a) to Me-18 and Me-19. All these NOEs require rings A and D nearer to boat conformations and cyclopronane ring on the a-side of the molecule. The structural assignment was also supported by comparing the 13C NMR spec- trum with that of hortiolide A (10) (Suárez et al., 2002). The ﬁnal conﬁrmation of the structure of 3, named hortiolide C, came from a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Fig. 2). The low temperature crystal structure of hortiolide C (3) shows the presence of two hortiolide molecules, one CH3OH and one water molecule per asymmetric unit (Tables S1 and S2). Ortep4 type view of both hortiolide C conformers showing selected atoms labeling and the 50% probability ellipsoids are presented in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. 9 O O O O O OMe OMe O 9 10 1 2 8 30 19 5 6 7 4 3 28 29 O O O R O O OMe O 30 8 12 11 9 14 30 29 28 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 5 4 3 1 O O O O MeO O O R'' R' R 2 7: R = H 8: R = OH 6 O O O O MeO O O OH OH 3: R = H, R' = H, R'' = OH 4: R = H, R' = OH, R'' = OH 5: R = OAc, R' = OH, R'' = H O O O O MeO O O OR 1: R = H 2: R = Ac O O O O MeO O O O 11 10 O O O O MeO O O Fig. 1.

(2002)), respectively. Assignments are based on HSQC and HMBC experiments. 54 V.G.P. Severino et al. / Phytochemistry 76 (2012) 52–59 Compound 4 showed spectroscopic characteristics close to those of 3 (C27H32O8). HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C27H32O9 for compound 4, requiring the presence of addi- tional oxygen in comparison with 3. The main change observed in the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 4 was the presence of an additional signal of hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom (d 4.89, brs). This oxymethine proton (d 4.89) showed one-bond correlation with the 13C NMR resonance at d 71.4 (HSQC) and a long-range correlation (HMBC) with the signals d 51.8 (C-5) and 175.4 (C-7), indicating the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-6. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for 3. The structure of the new natural product 4 was thus established as 6-hydroxyhortiolide C. Compound 5 displayed spectroscopic characteristics close to those of 4. Analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 5 estab- lished a pair of geminal doublets at d 2.23 and 2.02 (d, J = 10 Hz), which showed a long-range correlation (HMBC) with the 13C NMR signal of C-16 (d 170.4), indicating that a methylene must be a to C-16, requiring the D-ring as a saturated d-lactone. In HMBC experiments, the assignment of the unsubstituted C-12 could be determined from the correlation between the 1H NMR H3-18 signal at d 1.24 and the 13C NMR resonance at d 29.8, which showed a one-bond correlation with the 1H NMR signals at d 1.65 and 1.30, ascribed to H-12a and H-12b, respectively. The hydro- gens H2-12a,b were coupled to the hydrogen with 1H NMR reso- nance at d 4.39 (brs) assigned to H-11. The 1H NMR signal at d 4.39 and a methyl 1H NMR resonance at d 2.27 showed long-range correlation with the 13C NMR signal at d 170.7, indicating an acet- oxyl group at C-11. In the g-NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for 3. However, the NOE of the H-5 (d 2.53) coming from H-11 (d 4.39), required the acetoxyl group at C- 11 to be anti (a) to H-5. Thus, compound 5 was proposed as 11a- acetoxy-15-deoxy-6-hydroxyhortiolide C. The NMR spectra of compound 6 clearly indicated A and D rings, and side-chain C-6-C7 similar to 3. HREIMS indicated the molecu- lar formula C27H32O9, requiring the presence of an additional oxy- genate moiety in comparison with 3. However, the main changes observed in the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 6 was the presence of an additional signal of an oleﬁnic hydrogen (d 5.79, dd, J = 2.5, 2.3 Hz). In the HMBC experiments, the unsubstitut- ed C-12 could be determined from the correlation between the H3- 18 1H NMR resonance at d 1.42 and the 13C NMR signal at d 42.0, which showed one-bond correlation (HSQC) with the 1H NMR res- onances at d 2.38 (dd, J = 18.4, 2.5 Hz) and 2.18 (dd, J = 18.4, 2.3 Hz), ascribed to H-12a and H-12b, respectively. The hydrogens H2-12 were coupled to the oleﬁnic hydrogen at d 5.79, thus locat- ing the double bond between C-9 and C-11, and requiring cyclo- propane ring opening, when compared with 3. The oleﬁnic hydrogen at d 5.79 showed a one-bond correlation with the 13C NMR signal at d 131.5 and long-range correlation with the reso- nances d 42.0 (C-12), 48.6 (C-13) and 64.8 (C-14). The hydroxyl group must thus be connected to C-8 due to the observed 13C NMR signal for a hemiketal carbon at d 116.8, which showed a cross-peak with the 1H NMR signal of H3-30 (d 1.73). In the g- NOESY experiments, the observed NOE were similar to those found for 3. However, the NOE of the H3-18 (d 1.42) coming from H3-30 (d 1.73), required the Me-30 to be sin (a) to Me-18. These data were consistent with the structure 6 for this new limonoid, named hor- tiolide D. The NMR spectra of compound 7 clearly indicated C and D rings similar to guyanin (9, Jacobs and Ramdayal, 1986), and A ring with the side-chain C-6-C7 similar to 3 (Tables 1 and 2). The main changes observed in the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 7 were the presence of additional signals of a terminal methylene (d 4.92, 4.56, d, J = 3.9 Hz). From the HMBC experiments, the corre- lation found between the 1H NMR resonances at d 4.92 and 4.56 and the 13C NMR signals at d 162.5 and that for C-9 (d 62.2) led them to be assigned as H2-30 and C-8, respectively, hence indicat- ing that the terminal methylene must be vicinal to C-8. These observations, the presence of only four tertiary methyl groups (d 1.04, 1.14, 1.21, 1.35) and not ﬁve as in 3, indicated cyclopropane ring opening, resulting in a spiro[410,1,O,8.411–14]nonane with C-9 as spiro carbon. HREIMS indicated the molecular formula C27H30O7 and conﬁrmed the structure 7 for this compound. These data were consistent with the structure 7 for this new limonoid, named hortiolide E. Compounds 8 displayed spectroscopic characteristics close to those of 7 (C27H30O7). HRESIMS indicated the molecular formula to be C27H30O8 for compound 8, requiring the presence of addi- tional oxygen in comparison with 7. The principal difference ob- served in the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of compound 8 was the presence of an additional hydrogen signal attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom (d 4.12 t, J = 5.5 Hz). This oxymethine hydrogen (d 4.12) showed a one-bond correlation (HSQC) with the 13C NMR signal at d 76.5 and long-range correlations (HMBC) with the resonances d 61.5 (C-9), 169.3 (C-14) and 19.4 (Me-18), indicating the presence of a hydroxyl substituent at C-12. The hydrogen H-12 was coupled to the methylene hydrogen at d 2.64 (dd, J = 16.6, 5.5), 2.39 (d, J = 16.6) and to the hydroxyl hydrogen at d 2.80 (d, J = 5.5), assigned to H-11a, H-11b and 12-OH (no cor- relation in the HSQC spectrum), respectively. The C-17 resonance was expected to be displaced upﬁeld by the c-effect of the 12b- OH group (Asakawa et al., 1977). In comparison with the 13C NMR spectrum of the parent compound 7 (C-17, d 80.0), the 12b- OH group exerted 3.6 ppm upﬁeld shifts for the C-17 resonance po- sition (d 76.4). In the g-NOESY experiments, the NOE of the H3-18 (d 1.11) coming from H-12 (d 4.12), required the hydroxyl group at C-12 to be anti (b) to H3-18. In addition, the NOE of the H3-18 (d Fig. 2. ORTEP4 view of the compound 3, showing selected atoms labeling and the 50% probability ellipsoids: molecule A, molecule B. V.G.P. Severino et al. / Phytochemistry 76 (2012) 52–59 55 1.11) coming from H-30b (d 4.56), required the CH2-30 to be syn (a) to Me-18. The g-NOESY experiments facilitate the elucidation of the relative conﬁguration of C-9, which has the same stereo- chemistry as in guyanin (9, McLean et al., 1988). Thus, the struc- ture of compound 8 was proposed as 12b-hydroxyhortiolide E. 3. Concluding remarks As a result of this study and analysis of literature data (Jacobs and Ramdayal, 1986; Suárez et al., 1998, 2002), Hortia produces highly specialized limonoids that are similar to those from the Flin- dersia (Flindersioideae, Rutaceae; Breen et al., 1984), Cedrelopsis (Ptaeroxylaceae, Mulholland et al., 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004), Melia- ceae and Cneoraceae families (A,B-seco-limonoids) (da Silva and Gottlieb, 1987). The taxonomy of Hortia has been debatable and is in doubt. Groppo et al. (2008) in an analysis of sequence data from two noncoding regions of the chloroplast genome – rps 16 in- tron and trnL-trnF from 65 species of 59 genera representing all the subfamilies and tribes of Rutaceae, suggested that Adiscanthus and Hortia formed a very strong clade in all their analyses. Because of its baccate fruit and syncarpous ovary, (Engler, 1931) included Hortia as the single Neotropical genus in the Toddalioideae sub- tribe Toddaliinae. On the basis of its follicular fruit and apocarpous ovary, he included Adiscanthus in the Rutoideae, subtribe Galipei- nae, tribe Galipeae (names replacing the illegitimate Cuspariinae and Cusparieae, proposed by Kallunki and Pirani, 1998). Based on chemical characteristics, da Silva et al. (1988) placed Hortia within the Galipeae (Cusparia informal tribe, da Silva). Considering the complexity of the isolated limonoids, Hortia does not show any close afﬁnity to the genera of the Rutoideae and Toddalioideae. The familial position of Cedrelopsis has also been controversial. This genus was originally classiﬁed in the family Meliaceae and later in the Rutaceae and Ptaeroxylaceae (Pennington and Styles, 1975). Recently, molecular phylogenetic study classiﬁed Ptaeroxylaceae (including Cedrelopsis) in the Spathelioideae (Rutaceae; Razaﬁman- dimbison et al., 2010; Appelhans et al., 2011). Limonoid types of Cedrelopsis suggest a strong afﬁnity with the Hortia genus. How- ever, Cedrelopsis contains chromones which do not seem to be common in all Rutaceae genera, and these have only been found in the Spathelioideae, Dictyolomatoideae and the Cneoraceae O O O O MeO O O H H 3 Mono- oxygenase O=O O O O O MeO O O OH OH O2 /NADPH 6 H+ 2 O O O O MeO O O OH H 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 28 29 30 3 2 O O O O MeO O O OH H 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 28 29 30 H2O 8: R = OH H+ H+ [O] 2 3 4 1 O O O R O O OMe O H O O O R OMe O O HO O- O O O O O OMe OMe O 9 10 1 2 30 19 5 6 7 4 3 28 29 9 O O O O O OMe OMe O 9 10 1 2 8 30 19 5 6 7 4 3 28 29 7: R = H H2O ..

Severino et al. / Phytochemistry 76 (2012) 52–59 (Sartor et al., 2003; Lima et al., 2005). Indeed many chemists were perhaps interested in alkaloids from the Rutaceaea, and will rarely identify all potentially systematic important classes of compounds present in the plant. The low concentration of limonoids is also likely to be responsible for the complex limonoids must have re- mained undiscovered for many years in genera of the Toddalioi- deae. Thus, complex limonoids appear to be of little value in resolving the taxonomic situation of Hortia. Little tracer work has been conducted to study biosynthesis of the limonoids, and ideas on their biogenesis are derived from hypothetical chemical relations between the compounds which have been isolated. Compound 3 appears to be formed via cycliza- tion by electrophilic addition utilizing the unsaturated carboxyl at C-16, terminated by addition of hydride at C-11 in a 9,11-dehydro- hortiolide A precursor, followed by a reaction of the enol with the molecular oxygen, hydroxylating C-15, as summarized in Scheme 1. The biogenesis of compound 5 appears to be similar to that pro- posed for 3, however, by addition of water at C-11 and the enol accepting the proton at C-15 to form the original carboxyl moiety (Scheme 1). Compound 6 appears to be produced from compound 3 by ring expansion of cyclopropane by a monooxygenase with hydroxylation at C-8, as summarized in Scheme 1. In guyanin (9), the biogenetic process is believed to be based on oxidation, fol- lowed by rearrangement and recyclization of reactive intermedi- ates (McLean et al., 1988). Guyanin (9) was the only example of C-9 spirolimonoid, but now hortiolide E (7) and 12b-hydroxyhor- tiolide E (8) have the same spiro-ring arrangement. Thus, in princi- ple, hortiolide E (7) can represent an intermediate stage in the formation of guyanin (9) from a 9,11-dehydrohortiolide A precur- sor (Scheme 1). 4. Experimental 4.1. General Optical rotations were measured by using a Perkin Elmer 241 spectropolarimeter, or DIP 370 Jasco. NMR: Bruker DRX 400, ARX 200, with TMS as internal standard. High resolution EI-MS: VG Autospec-Fisons by using electron ionization technique at 70 eV (linked scan at 8 keV collisions with Helium); HRESI-MS analyses were performed on an UltroTOF-Q (Bruker Daltonics, USA) ﬁtted with an electrospray ion source operating in the positive ion mode; the accuracy masses were obtained by using TFA-Na+ (sodiated CF3CO2H) as internal standard; samples were directly infused into the ionization source at a ﬂow rate of 10 lL min-1; the source block and desolvation temperature was 150 �C. IR: Bomen-Ft/IR. 4.2. Plant material H. oreadica was collected in the Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke, Amazonas, Brazil, and identiﬁed by J.R. Pirani (Department of Bot- any, University of São Paulo). A voucher specimen (Groppo Jr. 458) was deposited in the herbarium of the cited department. 4.3. Extraction and isolation Ground taproots (3.3 kg), and stems (2.4 kg) of H. oreadica were successively extracted using hexane (3�, 5 L), CH2Cl2 (3�, 5 L) and MeOH (3�, 5 L), at room temperature. The concentrated CH2Cl2 ex- tract (67.6 g) from the taproots was subjected to column chroma- tography (CC), over silica gel (70–230 mesh; 20 cm� 8.0 cm) in vacuo. Elution with hexane, CH2Cl2 (1.0 L), EtOAc (1.0 L) and MeOH (1.0 L) yielded ﬁve fractions. The CH2Cl2 fraction was subjected to silica gel CC (230–400 mesh; 5.2 cm � 28.0 cm). Elution with a hexane–acetone gradient yielded 11 new fractions, of which fraction 10 was puriﬁed further on silica (230–400 mesh; 3.0 cm � 29.0 cm) two times with hexane–CH2Cl2–acetone (17:2:1), and then hexane–acetone (4:1), to afford compound 6 (127.6 mg). Fraction 11 was puriﬁed further on silica gel CC two times as described above using hexane–acetone (6:1), and hex- ane–acetone (4:1), respectively, to afford three new fractions (11a–c) containing limonoids. Fraction 11a was subjected to addi- tional silica gel CC as described above using hexane–acetone (2:0.4) and then to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) puriﬁcation (MeOH; detection UV k 364 nm, ﬂow rate: 3.0 mL min�1, polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G), and yielded compound 7 (9.6 mg). Fraction 11b was also further puriﬁed by silica gel CC as described above using hexane–acetone (3:1) as eluant and then by HPLC (MeOH:CH2Cl2, 80:20; detection UV k 364 nm, ﬂow rate: 3.0 mL min�1, polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G) puriﬁcation, yielding compound 9 (4.4 mg). Fraction 11c was subjected twice to HPLC eluted with MeOH:CH2Cl2 (80:20), and then MeOH, with detection at UV k 364 nm, and ﬂow rate of 3.0 mL min�1, using a polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G, to yield compound 2 (6.7 mg). The EtOAc fraction from the concentrated CH2Cl2 extract was subjected to silica gel CC (70–230 mesh, 5.3 cm � 41.0 cm) in vacuo. Elution with hexane (500 mL), CH2Cl2 (500 mL), EtOAc (500 mL) and MeOH (500 mL) yielded several fractions. All fractions were monitored by 1H NMR (200 MHz) and the fraction eluted with MeOH was exam- ined, which showed features of limonoids. This fraction was sub- jected to silica gel CC (230–400 mesh, 10.0 cm � 41.0 cm). Elution with a hexane-MeOH gradient yielded compound 8 (7.3 mg) and other fractions. Two of these fractions were subjected to HPLC (MeOH:CH2Cl2, 80:20, detection UV k 364 nm, ﬂow rate: 3.0 mL min�1, polymeric column Shodex Asahipak GS-310 2G), yielding compounds 3 (20 mg) and 5 (8.7 mg), respectively. The concentrated MeOH extract (3.0 g) from stems was parti- tioned into hexane (concentrated 0.28 g), CH2Cl2 (concentrated 0.754 g) and MeOH (concentrated 1.069 g) soluble fractions. The 1H NMR (200 MHz) spectra of these fractions showed that the ma- jor limonoids were in the CH2Cl2 soluble fraction, this being sub- jected to CC over silica gel (70–230 mesh, 10.0 cm � 41.0 cm). Elution with a hexane–MeOH gradient yielded new fractions, with two of these subjected to recycling high-performance liquid chro- matography (R-HPLC) (MeOH:CH2Cl2 1:1; detection UV k 217 and 254 nm, ﬂow rate: 3.0 mL min�1, polymeric column Shodex Asah- ipak GS-310 2G), to afford compounds 1 (8.0 mg) and 4 (6.0 mg) after recycling 2 times. 4.3.1. 9,11-Dehydro-12a-hydroxyhortiolide A (1) Amorphous white solid; ½a�25 D + 32.73 (c 0.010, CHCl3); IR (ﬁlm) vmax3436 (OH), 1732 (carboxyl group), 1638 (a,b-unsaturated ke- tone) cm�1; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), see Table 1; 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3), see Table 2; HSQC (400/100 MHz, CDCl3); COSY (400 MHz, CDCl3), HMBC (400/100 MHz, CDCl3): H-2 ?

Single-crystal structure determination of Hortiolide C (3) Room temperature X-ray diffraction data collection (u scans and x scans with j offsets) was performed on an Enraf–Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer (95 mm CCD camera on j-goniostat) using graphite-monochromated MoKa radiation (0.71073 Å). The data were collected up to 51.36� in 2h. The ﬁnal unit cell parame- ters were based on all reﬂections. Data collections were made using the COLLECT program (Enraf-Nonius, 1997–2000); integra- tion and scaling of the reﬂections were performed with the HKL Denzo-Scalepack software system (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). No absorption correction was applied.
