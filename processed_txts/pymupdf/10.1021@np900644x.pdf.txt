Box 4009, 01061-970, Sa˜o Paulo, SP, Brazil ReceiVed October 12, 2009 Two unusual pyridine alkaloids, 7′-multijuguinone (1) and 12′-hydroxy-7′-multijuguinone (2), were isolated from the leaves of Senna multijuga, together with the known ﬂavonoid rutin. The structures of the new alkaloids were established on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited moderate in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, in comparison with the standard compound physostigmine. Senna multijuga (Rich.) Irwin et Barneby (syn. Cassia multijuga Rich.) (Fabaceae) is a medium-size evergreen tree distributed widely in several Brazilian regions and other biomes from Africa.1 Several chemical studies of seeds, leaves, and roots have shown the occurrence of ﬂavonoids,2 anthraquinones,3,4 polysaccharides,5 and chromones.6 In Brazil, this species is popularly known as “pau- cigarra”, “caquera”, “topeiuia”, “aleluia”, and “canafı´stula” and is used as an ornamental plant in several regions of the country due to its attractive yellow ﬂowers.1,7 Although some species of the Senna (Cassia) genus have been reported to be an important source of phenolic compounds with diverse biological and pharmacological properties,8 only the seeds of S. multijuga are used for the treatment of ophthalmic and skin infections.2 However, no phytochemical study on the isolation of the secondary metabolites of this species has been conducted previously. As part of our ongoing research on Atlantic Forest plant species,9 we selected S. multijuga for study. From an ethanolic extract of the leaves were isolated two new pyridine alkaloids, 7′-multijuguinone (1) and 12′-hydroxy-7′- multijuguinone (2), together with the known ﬂavonoid rutin.10 The occurrence of 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-alkyl pyridine alkaloids is unusual, and only one report has been described in the literature.11 Herein, we present the isolation, structure elucidation, and acetyl- cholinesterase-inhibitory properties of 1 and 2 by bioautography and microplate screening assays. The ﬁrst Dragendorff-positive compound, 7′-multijuguinone (1), was isolated as a white solid, mp 103-105 °C. The molecular weight of 1 was measured by HRESITOFMS, and the molecular formula was established as C18H29NO2, with a hydrogen deﬁciency index of 5. The observed pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 292.2271 [M + H]+ was calculated for C18H30NO2, 292.2271. The UV spectrum, with absorption maxima at 222 and 287 nm, suggested the presence of a ketone and substituted aromatic moiety chro- mophores, respectively. IR absorption bands were assigned to hydroxy (3401 cm-1), carbonyl (1701 cm-1), and pyridine ring (1578, 1498, and 1464 cm-1) functional groups. Examination of the 1H, 13C, and DEPT NMR spectra recorded in CDCl3 (Table 1) showed the presence of a 2,3,6-trisubstituted pyridine ring [δ 7.00 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-4), 6.84 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-5); δ 145.3 (C-2), 148.8 (C-3), 122.7 (C-4), 120.8 (C-5), and 152.9 (C-6)], two methyl groups at δ 0.88 (t, H-12′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 13.9) and 2.47 (s, H-7, δC 18.5), and 10 methylenes at δ 2.67 (t, H-1′, J ) 8.0 Hz, δC 37.0), 1.64 (qt, H-2′, J ) 8.0 Hz, δC 30.2), 1.30 (m, H-3′, H-4′, and H-11′, δC 29.1, 29.0, and 22.4), 1.55 (qt, H-5′ and H-9′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 23.8 and 23.5), 2.36 (t, H-6′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 42.7), 2.37 (t, H-8′, J ) 7.5 Hz, δC 42.8), and 1.27 (m, H-10′, δC 31.4) and suggested the presence of a long linear side chain in the structure of 1. Furthermore, the side chain from C-1′ to C-12′ was deduced as being attached at C-6 of the pyridine nucleus by a gHMBC NMR experiment. Three-bond correlations were observed from H-5 to C-1′, H-1′ to C-5, and H-2′ to C-6 (Figure 1), supporting a 2-methyl- 3-hydroxy-6-n-alkyl pyridine substitution pattern. The 7′-oxodode- cyl unit linked at C-6 is different from the long-chain pattern observed for other piperidine and pyridine alkaloids from Senna (Cassia) species. The position of the 7′-oxo group on the straight side chain was also deﬁned by gHMBC data analysis, for which the main correlations are represented in Figure 1. Furthermore, in a TOCSY experiment irradiation of H-1′ and H-12′ showed ⊥ Dedicated to the late Dr. John W. Daly of NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, and the late Dr. Richard E.

J. Nat. Prod. 2010, 73, 482–484 482 10.1021/np900644x  2010 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy Published on Web 12/14/2009 correlations with H-2′-H-6′ and H-8′-H-12′, respectively. HO- MODEC experiments were carried out decoupling H-2′ (δ 1.64), which enabled the loss of multiplicity from the neighboring H-1′ and H-3′ (overlapped with H-4′). When H-5′ was decoupled, loss of multiplicity was observed for H-6′ and H-4′ (overlapped with H-3′), supporting the same chemical shift for H-3′ and H-4′. The same pattern was observed with H-10′ and H-11′ when H-9′ and H-12′ were decoupled. The interpretation of these gHMBC sequence cross-peaks led to the establishment of the oxo function at the C-7′ position in the side chain. Furthermore, the gHMBC correlations of H-5 with C-3 (3J) and C-1′ (3J), together with that from H-7 to C-2 (2J) and C-3 (3J), allowed the hydroxy group to be located at C-3, which was consistent with a previous study on bioactive piperidine alkaloids from Senna (Cassia) species, with features similar to 1.9 Additionally, the gHMBC (1H-15N) spectrum showed a correlation between the nitrogen signal at δ 308.8 and signals at δ 2.67 (H-1′), 6.84 (H-5), and 2.47 (H-7). All this evidence agreed with the hydroxy group being located at C-3 and conﬁrmed the assumption made on the substitution pattern in pyridine alkaloid 1, which must be 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-(7′-oxododecyl) pyridine, similar to those found for piperidine alkaloids from other Senna (Cassia) species, except for the ketone group position in the side chain. These results suggested that the hydroxy group of this pyridine alkaloid is at C-3, which is not in agreement with those previously reported for a similar pyridine alkaloid from this species, with no hydroxy group being located at C-5.5 Compound 2 was obtained as a white solid, mp 71-73 °C, and gave a positive test with Dragendorff reagent. This compound showed spectroscopic features very similar to those of 1. The HRESITOFMS for 2 exhibited a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 308.2226 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO3, 308.2220), appropriate for the molecular formula C18H29NO3, with a hydrogen deﬁciency index of 5 and being 16 mass units more than that of 1. The IR spectrum revealed the carbonyl absorption band at 1703 cm-1, a pyridine ring at 1584, 1489, and 1464 cm-1, and a hydroxy group band at 3392 cm-1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 2 showed signals very close to those of 1 (Table 1), as in the 1H NMR spectrum, which demonstrates the presence of a substituted pyridine ring system at δ 7.02 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-4) and 6.85 (1H, d, J ) 8.0 Hz, H-5). Additionally, the methyl hydrogens of CH3-7 at δ 2.48, analyzed together with 13C NMR data, conﬁrmed that the pyridine moiety is similar to that of 1. However, differences were evident between these compounds since the methyl group (CH3-12′) located in the side chain of 1 was replaced with a hydroxy methylene group in 2 at δ 3.67 (2H, t, J ) 6.5, H-12′, δC 62.5). These data, supported by the 13C NMR, DEPT, gCOSY, gHMQC, gHMBC, TOCSY, and HOMODEC spectra, were in agreement with a pyridine system bearing one hydroxy group, one methyl, and one long-chain substituent. According to these data, the structure of 2 was determined as 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-6-n-(7′-oxo-12′-hydroxy- dodecyl)pyridine. All compounds isolated were screened for their AChE inhibitory activity, using bioautography and microplate tests, and the results are shown in Table 2. The preliminary TLC assay suggested moderate activity for compounds 1 and 2, which showed the minimum amounts of these alkaloids required for AChE inhibition of 0.75 and 0.18 µg, respectively, when compared with physostigmine (positive control, 0.05 µg). Rutin proved to be inactive, since the minimum amount required to show activity was over 100 µg. In addition, the microplate test conﬁrmed activity of the compounds 1 and 2, which exhibited weak AChE inhibition of 13% and 30% at 350 mM. Experimental Section General Experimental Procedures. Melting points were recorded on a digital Microquimica MQAPF-302 apparatus and are uncorrected. UV data were acquired using an Amersham Ultrospec 2100 pro UV/ vis spectrophotometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iS10 FT- IR spectrometer coupled with an ATR accessory (the samples were pressed against a crystal of Ge). The 1D (1H, 13C, DEPT, NOESY, TOCSY, and HOMODEC) and 2D (1H-1H gCOSY, gHMQC, gH- MBC, and 1H-15N gHMBC) NMR experiments were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer (11.7 T) at 500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C) at 30 °C and referenced using TMS (δTMS ) 0.00) as internal standard or residual solvent resonances of CDCl3 at δ 7.26 and 77.0 ppm, respectively, for 1H and 13C. High-resolution mass spectra with electrospray ionization were measured on an ultrOTOFQ (Bruker Daltonics) operating in positive mode. MeOH-H2O (4:1) was used as solvent system. TLC was performed on silica gel F254 plates (0.20 mm, Fluka), and spots were visualized under UV light (254 and 366 nm) and spraying with Dragendorff’s reagent or anisaldehyde-H2SO4, followed by charring for 5 min. Preparative TLC was carried out with Analtech 500 µm thick silica gel GF plates (20 × 20 cm, Uniplate) and visualized under UV light at 366 nm. Analytical HPLC separation was performed on a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) ProStar system equipped with a ternary pump model 340, a photodiode array detector model 330, and an autosampler model 410, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.52 software. Preparative HPLC separation was performed on a Varian PrepStar system equipped with a UV-vis detector model 320 and a binary pump model SD-1 manual injector, controlled by Star chromatography workstation version 5.51 software. The columns used were a Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 × 4.60 mm, 5 µm) and a preparative Phenomenex Luna C18 (250 × 21.20 mm, 10 µm) protected by corresponding guard columns. All solvents used in the experimental procedures were distilled previously. For chromatographic analysis, HPLC-grade solvents (J. T. Baker, Xalostoc, Mexico) were employed. Water was puriﬁed immediately prior to use with a Milli Q plus system (Millipore, Milford, MA). Plant Material. Leaves of S. multijuga were collected in Araraquara (Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) in July 2008 by one of the authors (M.P.). The plant was identiﬁed by Ineˆs Cordeiro from the Institute of Botany in Sa˜o Paulo-SP, Brazil. A voucher specimen (SP 384103) has been deposited in the herbarium of this institute. Extraction and Isolation. The dried and powdered leaves (2.7 kg) were extracted with ethanol (8 L × 4) for ﬁve days at room temperature. Figure 1. Key gHMBC correlations for 1 and 2. Table 2.

Notes Journal of Natural Products, 2010, Vol. 73, No. 3 483 The solvent was removed under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation, yielding a thick syrup (210 g). The crude ethanol extract (100 g) was further reconstituted in MeOH-H2O (4:1), ﬁltered, and then partitioned with n-hexane (250 mL × 5), CH2Cl2 (250 mL × 4), EtOAc (250 mL × 4), and n-BuOH (250 mL × 2), successively. All phases were concentrated under reduced pressure. The CH2Cl2 fraction (15.9 g) was dissolved in 500 mL of 5% HCl aqueous solution (ca. pH 2), ﬁltered, and partitioned with EtOAc (50 mL × 3) to remove nonbasic components. Then, NH4OH (30%) was added to the aqueous phase until ca. pH 8.5 and partitioned with CH2Cl2 (50 mL × 5). The latter organic layer was washed with H2O (100 mL × 3) and concentrated in order to give a neutral alkaloidal fraction (457 mg), which was puriﬁed by using preparative TLC with n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc (1.5: 2.0:6.5) as developing solvent (×2). The bands with Rf values of 0.50 and 0.18 were scraped and eluted with MeOH, affording pure compounds 1 (49.1 mg) and 2 (60.5 mg). Fraction EtOAc (2.20 g) was subjected to column chromatography on RP-C18 and eluted with MeOH-H2O (5:95 to 100:0) to yield six fractions (EtOAc-F1 to EtOAc- F6). Fractions EtOAc-F2 and EtOAc-F3 (527 mg) were further puriﬁed by preparative HPLC on RP-C18 and eluted with MeOH-H2O (40:60, ﬂow rate 19 mL/min, UV 254 nm), affording compound 3 (tR 17.4 min, 42.0 mg). Bioautographic Assay. The AChE inhibitory activity of pure compounds was determined using a TLC bioautographic assay as previously described.12 The TLC layers were spotted with 1 and 2 in a range from 0.09 to 6.00 µg developed with n-hexane-EtOAc (1:4, v/v) and subsequently dried. The plates were then sprayed with the enzyme solution (6.66 U/mL), thoroughly dried, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min (moist atmosphere). Enzyme activity was detected by spraying with a solution consisting of 0.25% of 1-naphthyl acetate in EtOH plus 0.25% aqueous solution of Fast Blue B salt. Potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors appeared as clear zones on a purple- colored background. Electric eel AChE type V (product no. C 2888, 1000 U) and the other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Microplate Assay. The AChE inhibitory activity of compounds 1-3 was evaluated using the modiﬁed methods of Ellman et al. and Rhee et al. in a 96-well microplate, as previously described.13 Using this method, the enzyme hydrolyzes the substrate acetylthiocholine, resulting in the production of thiocholine, which reacts with 5,5′-dithiobis(2- nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to produce 2-nitrobenzoate-5-mercaptothio- choline and 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate and can be detected at 405 nm. To the 96-well plates were added 25 µL of an aqueous solution of acetylthiocholine iodide (15 mM), 125 µL of DTNB (3 mM) in buffer C, 50 µL of buffer B, and 25 µL of sample diluted in buffer A, to give a range of concentrations from 0.78 to 100 µg/mL. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm every 30 s three times. Furthermore, 25 µL of 0.22 U/mL of the enzyme was added and the absorbance was again read every 10 min two times. Any increase in absorbance due to the spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by subtracting the rate of the reaction before the addition of the enzyme from the rate of the enzyme reaction. The percentage of inhibition was calculated in comparison to a blank (10% MeOH in buffer A), and a positive control of physostigmine was used in the same range of concentrations. The following buffers were used: buffer A, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8); buffer B, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin V fraction; buffer C, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.10 M NaCl and 0.02 M MgCl2·6H2O. All of the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 7′-Multijuguinone (1): white solid; mp 103-105 °C; UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 222 (3.83), 287 (3.63) nm; IR νmax 3401, 2919, 2849, 1701, 1578, 1498, 1464, 1285, 1164, 1130, 832, 725 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Table 1; HRESITOFMS m/z 292.2271 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO2, 292.2271); TLC Rf 0.50 (1.5:2.0:6.5 n-hexane- CH2Cl2-EtOAc). 12′-Hydroxy-7′-multijuguinone (2): white solid; mp 71-73 °C; UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε) 222 (3.83), 287 (3.63) nm; IR (ﬁlm) νmax 3392, 2931, 2851, 1703, 1584, 1489, 1464, 1290, 1248, 1160, 1128, 1048, 827, 725 cm-1; 1H and 13C NMR data see Table 1; HRES- ITOFMS m/z 308.2226 [M + H]+ (calcd for C18H30NO3, 308.2220); TLC Rf 0.18 (1.5:2:6.5 n-hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc).
