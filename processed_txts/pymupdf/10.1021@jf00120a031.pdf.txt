Alencar, P. B. Alves, and A. A. Craveiro*  Pyrolysis products of babassu (Orbignya martiana), piqui (Caryocar coriaceum), and palm oils (Elaeis  guineensis) were analyzed by GC/MS using library search programs. The chief products of pyrolysis  were straight-chain alkanes and 1-alkenes. Small amounts of cyclic hydrocarbons were detected in  triglycerides constituted by oleic acid as the major moiety. Pyrolysis of oleic acid was also studied. A  pathway for the cracking reactions involved with the decomposition of the saturated fatty acids is  proposed.  Edible oils are essential for the human diet and therefore  their use for other purposes has thus far not recieved much  attention. However, during and after World War I1 several  studies on the pyrolysis of vegetable oils were carried out  for using the products thus obtained as fuel (Otto, 1945;  Chang and Wan, 1947; Hsu et al., 1950). The studies  concerning the chemical composition of the volatile com-  pounds produced were not complete due to instrumental  limitation and the analytical methods thus used (Hsu et  al., 1950). Reports on the thermal cracking of behenic acid  by Jurg and Eisma (1964) showed that C&  hydrocarbons  were chiefly produced when betonite was used as the  catalyst. However, Traitler and Kratzl (1980) obtained  n-alkylbenzenes from pyrolysis of fatty acids using lignin  as the catalyst. Craveiro et al. (1981a,b) obtained long-  chain methyl ketones when babassu oil was pyrolyzed in  the presence of CaO.  On the basis of these studies it is clear that the pyrolysis  products from fatty acids or glycerides are highly de-  pendent on the nature and amount of catalyst used. For  this reason we decided to investigate cracking reactions,  carried out in the absence of catalyst, of three vegetable  oils extracted from native or acclimated plants largely  dispersed in northern and northeastern Brazil: Orbygnya  martiana (babassu), Caryocar coriaceum (piqui), and  Elaeis guineensis (palm).  EXPERIMENTAL SECTION  Samples. Crude oil samples of babassu and piqui oils  were obtained from industries in the state of Cearl, and  the palm oil was a commercial sample originated from  Bahia State.  Pyrolysis.

Gas Chromatography and Gas Chromatography/  Mass Spectrometry. Analytical chromatograms were  obtained on a FID Varian instrument equipped with fused  silica capillary column (30 m X 0.20 mm i.d.) by using  methyl silicone as the stationary phase, N, as the carrier  gas (1 mL/min) at 40-250 OC, and 4 OC/min programmed  temperature conditions. The separation and analysis of  the cracked samples were made on a H P  5995 mass  spectrometer coupled to GC equipped with a glass open  tubular column (SP 2100, 30 m X 0.25 mm i.d.) using He  as the carrier gas (1 mL/min) and the temperature pro-  grammed as above. Chromatographic retention times and  peak areas were used to calculate Kovat’s indexes and  compound percentages, respectively.  Compound Identifications. Compound identifications  involved library search programs (Craveiro et al., 1981a,b)  and visual comparison with published mass spectra  (Stenhagen et al., 1974; Heller and Milne, 1978).

Computer Programs. Computer programs for calcu-  lation of Kovat's indexes and mass spectra comparisons  were either developed in our laboratorv or were derived  for H P  9825A calculator software.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The fatty acid content of babassu and palm oils are  well-known (Costa, 1967; Heiduschka and Agsten, 1930).  The composition presented in Table I for these oils as well  as for piqui oil was derived from GC/MS analysis (as Me  esters) carried out in our laboratory. Pyrolysis of the crude  oils were performed in a Pyrex apparatus and was accom-  panied by the evolution of gas due to decarboxylation  reactions. This afforded a mixture of n-alkanes and 1-  alkenes as the major products (94.46% for babassu, 68.20%  for piqui, for 95.55% for palm oils; see Table 11). Note-  worthy differences in the cracking patterns (Table 11) seem  to be associated with the unsaturated fatty acid content  (mainly oleic acid) in the original oils, which is likely to  generate more volatile molecules than their saturated  counterparts. Furthermore, it is possible to make an as-  sociation between the major saturated fatty acid present  in the original oil and the chief saturated hydrocarbon in  the pyrolysis product, the latter being generated by de-  carboxylation of the former.  Triglycerides constituted by oleic acid as the major  moiety produced in addition to straight-chain hydro-  carbons cycloparaffins and cycloolefins in small amounts.  The formation of these cyclic hydrocarbons may be  probably related to cyclizations in which the 9-10 double  bond of oleic acid plays an important role.  The absence of oxygenated compounds among the  volatiles identified in Table II suggests that the elimination  of C02 and CHz=CO were dominant steps in the cracking  reactions of triglycerides and fatty acids, at least in the  absence of catalyst.  The formation of a complete series of n-alkanes and  1-alkenes (Table 11) is consistent with the generation of  yields,  9c (viv)  Kovat's oleic  piqui  compound  M ,  indexes acid  oil  methylcyclohexane  ethy lcy clopentene"  methylcyclohexene"  ethy lcyclohexane  ethylcyclohexene"  n-prop y Icy clohexane  n-propylcyclohexene",  n-butylcyclopentene"  n-butylcyclohexane  n-am ylcy clopentaneC  n-amylcyclopentene",  n-butylcyclohexene",  n-amylcyclohexaneb  n-amylcyclohexene"?  n-hexylcyclopentane",  n-hexylcyclopenteneaic  n-hexylcyclohexaneb  n-heptylcyclopentene",  n-hexylcyclohexene"  n-octylcyclopentaneb  n-octylcyclohexane  n-nonylcyclohexane  total accounted for  98  96  96  112  110  126  124  124  140  140  138  138  154  152  154  152  168  166  166  182  196  210  715  755  760  825  860  922  938  940  1028  1031  1038  1042  1122  1135  1132  1137  1229  1240  1242  1337  1437  1535  0.71 0.31  0.23  0.71 0.31  0.31 0.20  0.39 0.20  0.15  0.13  4.18  0.28 0.13  0.15  0.47  0.23 0.21  0.20  0.12  0.25 0.21  0.20  0.63 0.17  0.25  0.36 0.18  0.35  0.98  1.12 0.89  11.27 3.94  a Chromatographic retention times and mass spectra  fragmentation were insufficient to ascertain the position  of the double bond in the ring.

Estimated Potential of Babassu Palm  (Orbignyo spp.)  The presence of alkylcyclopentanes and alkylcyclo-  hexanes in the pyrolysis of oils with high oleic acid content  indicates that ring formation may occur with the assistance  of the double bond through a mechanism similar to that  proposed in Figure 1.  The high potential of one of these palms as renewable  resource of energy is illustrated in Chart I, which is an  overview of the major products obtained from babassu nut;  this palm tree grows wild throughout more than 35 million  acres in the Brazilian northeastern states.

Effects of Various Anions on the Rheological and Gelling Behavior of Soy Proteins:  Thermodynamic Observations  Maria Babajimopoulos,l Srinivasan Damodaran,* Syed S. H. Rizvi, and John E. Kinsella  The effects of neutral salts on the gelation of soy protein isolate and the 7s and 11s protein fractions  were studied. The relative effects of salts on the viscosities of progel and gel followed the lyotropic series  for anions, i.e., ,503-  < C1- < Br- < SCN-. NaSCN, which is a protein structure destabilizer, profoundly  increased the melting temperature as well as viscosity of the gel, whereas NaCl, which is a protein structure  stabilizer, decreased the gel viscosity but increased the melting temperature. However, the AHo of gelation  was unaffected by the type of the salts used and exhibited a value of about 1 kcal/mol. On the basis  of the results, we invoke that the major forces involved in the gelation of soy protein is hydrogen bonding  and van der Waals interactions; the contribution of hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction is negligible.
