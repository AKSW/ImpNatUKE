BIOGENETICALLY  SIGNIFICANT  TRITERPENES  IN A  SPECIES OF MELIACEAE:  CABRQLEA POLYTRICHA  A.JUSS.  S. C. CASCON  Instituto de Tecnologia Agricola e Alimentar, MinistCrio da Agricultura, Rio de Janeiro, ZC-20, Braxil  and  K. S. BROWN, JR.  Centro de Pesquisas de Produtos Natutais, Facuidadc de Farmacia, U.F.R.J., Rio dc Janeiro, ZC-82,  Brazil  (Receiwd in the UK 24 July 1971; Acceptedforpubiicorion  24 August 1971)  a-Four  triterpcnes have been isolated from the fruits of Cabrakn polyrricha A.Juss. (Mehaceae).  Two of them are new Cs, compounds whose structures have been established as the C-3, C-24 epimer of  ocotillol-II and the C-24 epimer of ocotillone-II: 20s. 24Sepoxydammaranc-3x,25dioi  (Ha) and the  corresponding 3-keto compound (IVa).  The otha two are the synthetically known trisnorlactone of Mills and the corresponding 3a-hydroxy  compound (also new), that is, 25,26,27-trisnor-#)~hydroxy-3-oxodammarane-24-ic  acid 20,241actone  (VII) and 25.26,27-trisnor-3&?0~hydroxydammarane-24-oic  acid 20.24htctone (Via).  PLAN-IX or THE FAMILY Meliaceae have been the source of novel triterpenes, especially  tetranor-triterpenes  (limonoids) and CsO protolimonoids  (related to the limonoids  by common stereochemistry,  but possessing a tetrahydrofuran  ring in the side chain  instead of a furan).’ These compounds apparently are formed by enzymatic oxidation  and degradation of the tetracyclic triterpenoid precursor, euphol.  Cabralea polytricha A.Juss., family Meliaceae, sub-family Melioideae, is a shrub  known in Brazil by the popular name of “‘cangerana”, a generic denomination  for  various Cabralea spexies. It is not so well known as Cabralea cangerana Sald., a large  tree much employed for timber, whose root bark has widespread use in popular  medicine as a panacea against many ills. Cabralea fruits are also reported to have  insecticidal properties. To date, the genus Cabralea has received very little chemical  attention.  Extraction of the fruits of C. polytrich and chromatography  on silica gel resulted  in the isolation of four triterpenes. not belonging to the limonoid or protolimonoid  type. but shown instead to possess the dammarane skeleton. Dammarane triterpenes  have previously been isolated from resins of Dipterocarpaceae.  roots of Areliaceae  and Compositae. and leaves of Betulaceae.2 There is also one known occurrence of a  triterpene  with this skeleton in the Meliaceae: aglaiol (I) from A&&  o&rata3  with a 24,25epoxide,  possessing a side chain of intermediate structure between that  of dipterocarpol  and those of the compounds isolated from Cabralea.  315  316  s. C. CASCON  The  main component  of the fruits of Cabralea polytrich  is cabraleadiol  (Ha),  yield @25”/:, m.p. 175-176”, [a]n + 18”. IR absorption at 3600 cm-’ and 1030-1070  cm- ’ indicates the presence of OH and ether groups. The NMR spectrum (Table I)  shows 8 peaks for quartemary  C-Me groups and signals for an equatorial proton  (J = 3,3 Hz) under an OH group, and a further proton under an oxygen function,  presumably an ether. The mass spectrum presents a molecular ion peak at m/e 460  (C,,H,,Os)  with base peak at m/e 143 (CsH1s02), presumably derived from the side  chain which could thus include either an hydroxylated  tetrahydropyran  ring or a  tetrahydrofurylisopropanol,  similar to that of ocotillol (III).9 The chemistry of IIa  (below) suggests an ocotillol side chain, although cabraleadiol is not identical to that  triterpene.  Cabraleadiol is inert to alkali, acid and LAH, and yields upon acetylation at room  temp a monoacetate  (IIb) m.p. 148-149”, and under vigorous conditions (reflux for  several hr) a diacetate, m.p. 129-132” (11~).

The diacetate  shows corresponding signals (Table I) for 8 quarternary C-Me groups. with two much  more deshielded than in the monoacetate,  supoorting the presence of a substituted  isopropanol group in the sidechain : and for two acetyl Me’s, one proton under an AcO  group, and the proton under the ether, also somewhat deshielded by the second acetate.  The monoacetate  cannot be oxidised with Cr03 in pyridine (Sarett’s reagent);  under the same conditions cabraleadiol yields cabraleone (see following paragraph).  Jones’ reagent (CrO,/acetone)  smoothly oxidises cabraleadiol to Mills’ keto-trisnor-  lactone (VII), strongly supporting structure IIa for the natural diol.  Cabraleone (IVa), m.p. 160-161”, [z]n + 54”, is a lesser component of the fruits  (yield 009%). It forms a crystalline oxime and dinitrophenylhydrazone.  IR absorption  at 36OOcm-’ indicates the presence of an OH group. at 1680 cm- ’ a ketone and at  1050-1100 cm-’ an ether linkage. The same eight quarternary  C-Me groups as in  cabraleadiol appear in the NMR spectrum. along with the multiplet for the proton  under the ether.  In the mass spectrum the highest detectable peak is at m/e 443, evidently resulting  from the loss of 15 units (Me) from m/e 458, the presumed molecular ion (C,,H,,O,).  The base peak, as in cabraleadiol. is at m/e 143 (now formulated as a). These data  indicate the identity of the sidechain in IIa and IVa. with a 3u (axial)-alcohol in IIa  and a 3-keto function in IVa.  Cabraleone. like cabraleadiol monoacetate (IIb). is not oxidised by Sarett’s reagent.  Jones oxidation  yields. in like manner, Mills’ lactone (VII). Cabraleone  may be  monoacetylated  under forcing conditions.  Reduction of cabraleone by LAH gives an isomer (Va) of cabraleadiol which upon  acetylation gives a monoacetate  (WI). m.p. 171-173”, with IR bands at 355.0 cm-’  (OH) and 1730 cm-’ (OAc). The NMR spectrum shows signals for 8 quartemary  C-Me groups and one acetyl Me. The multiplet under the ether is present and un-  changed,buttheprotonundertheOHgroupisnowaxial(J  = 6,10Hz).Thiscompound  was shown to be identical to the monoacetate of the C-24 epimer of ocotillol-II, pre-  pared by Biellmann4 during oxidation  of 3-acetyldammarenediol  (IX) with p-  nitroperbenzoic acid. The comparison was made through m.m.p., IR and NMR spectra.  By this interrelation, the structure of cabraleadiol is established as the C-3. C-24  epimer of ocotillol-II;  cabraleone is the C-24 epimer of ocotillone-II. Recent work’  has proven through chemical interrelations and X-ray crystallography that the stereo-  chemistry at C-24 of ocotillol-II is R, with the hydroxyisopropyl  at C-24 trans to the  Me at C-20. The same work reports a C-24 epimer, the structure of which was estab-  lished as 24S, that is, with the substituents at C-24 and C-20 in a cis conliguration.  Cabraleadiol and cabraleone should have the latter stereochemistry.  A third component  of the fruits is cabraleahydroxylactone  (Via), yield 003%.  m.p. 24O-242”, [a],,  + 24”. with IR absorption at 3550 cm-’ (OH) and 1760 cm-’  (y-lactone). The NMR spectrum (Table I) shows signals for 6 quartemary  C-Me  groups, with only one downfield of 1 ppm. An additional signal at 3.4 ppm is identical  to that corresponding  to the 38-proton in the spectrum of cabraleadiol (IIa). The  mass spectrum shows a molecular ion at m/e416, corresponding to a trisnor-triterpene.  C27H4403. The base peak. at m/e 189. is derived from separation of rings A and B (b).  Under mild acetylation conditions, cabraleahydroxylactone  forms a monoacetate,  318  .% c.

The  NMR spectrum (Table I) shows one acetyl Me and 6 quarternary C-Me signals ; the  signal for the 38-proton is moved downfield to 4.64 ppm.  Reduction of Via with LAH yields a compound melting at 210-211”, with no IR  absorption in the carbonyl region. Jones oxidation of Via, as with IIa and IVa, forms  the lactone VII.  Cabralealactone  (VII), yield O-07%, m.p. 181-183”, [aID + 70”, shows IR absorption  at 1700 cm-’ (ketone) and 1760 cm-’ (y-lactone). The NMR spectrum (Table I)  shows six signals for quartemary C-Me groups, and no signals downfield of 2.8 ppm.  The mass spectrum indicates a molecular weight of 414, corresponding to C,,H,,O,  ;  the base peak is at m/e 99 (c). These spectral data suggest that cabralealactone  is a  trisnor-triterpene  ketone-y-lactone.  As mentioned, the other triterpenes isolated from the fruits of C. polytricha all  yield VII upon Jones oxidation, thus interrelating these four compounds. The product,  cabralealactone,  has spectral characteristics identical to those reported for the keto-  trisnor-lactone,  first prepared by the CrO, oxidation of dipterocarpol  by Mill~.~  Comparison  by m.m.ps, IR and NMR spectra showed the two compounds to be  identical.  For further confirmation, mild NaBH, reduction of VII and subsequent acetylation  yielded a compound identical to the 38-acetoxyd ammar-y-lactone  VIII, prepared  by Biellmann4 through Cr03 oxidation of 3-acetyldammarenediol  (IX).  Compounds Ha, IVa, Via, and VII have not been previously isolated from natural  sources, though VII has been prepared in the laboratory  by different oxidation  reactions  of dipterocarpol  and dammarenediol.4~ 6 They apparently  represent  oxidative degradation products of a normal triterpenoid precursor, which may be the  3-epimer of dammarenediol  (unknown to date). Cabraleadiol and cabraleone would  be intermediates in the pathway to the further oxidation products, cabraleahydroxylac-  tone and cabralealactone. A model experiment along this lines was performed in vitro  by E. H. Warnhoff,’ who demonstrated the formation of ocotillol-II (III) as well as its  C,, epimer from acetyldammarenediol  (IX), by treatment with perphthalic  acid.  These two epimers are also formed when p-nitroperbenzoic  acid is employed instead.4  The occurrence in C. polyrricha of dammarane triterpenes, instead of the euphol  degradation products normally encountered in the Meliaceae, may be explained by the  relatively close chemical relationship of the two groups. For example, it is well known  that euphenol and tirucallenol, upon acid treatment in r&o, are rearranged to iso-  euphenol and isotirucallenol,  with the dammarane  carbon skeleton and stereo-  chemistry, a fact which was used by Ruzicka, Jeger and Arigoni’ and D. H. R. Barton9  to elucidate the euphol structure. A. Eschenmoser, L. Ruzicka, 0. Jeger e D. Arigoni”  assumed that euphol and tirucallol should have a common precursor in uiuo (which  would also be the precursor of dammarenediol),  formed by a rrans-anti- tram cycli-  sation of squalene (epoxide) in a chair, chair, chair boat conformation. This cationic  tetracyclic triterpene precursor (X), either by a series of concerted or ethylenic inter-  mediate migrations, could attain the euphol or tirucallol structure, differing only in  configuration  at C-20. Euphol and tirucallol possess a chair-boat  conformation  in rings B and Cg while dammarenediol,  which could arise from direct reaction  of the precursor (X) with water at C-20, has the more stable chair conformation  in  rings A, B and C.  Biogenetically significant triterpenes  321  EXPERIMENTAL  Mps were determined on a Kofler block and are uncorrected. IR spectra were taken as KBr pellets on a  Perkin-Elmer Model 12C.
