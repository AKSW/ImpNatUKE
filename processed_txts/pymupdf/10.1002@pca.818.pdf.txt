Cavalheiro* Núcleo de Bioensaios, Bissíntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Instituto de Química, UNESP, Araraquara-SP 14800-900, Brazil An HPLC-PAD method has been developed in order to evaluate simultaneously the main secondary meta- bolites, ﬂavonoid glycosides and styrylpyrones, of leaves of Cryptocarya moschata. The sample preparation, consisting of extraction, liquid–liquid extraction and centrifugation, requires minimum sample manipulation but produces high yields with reproducibility, selectivity and simplicity. HPLC on a C18 column presents each class of metabolites grouped and with good resolution of the main compounds. The experimental conditions can be used to study inter- and intra-speciﬁc variability of secondary metabolites in Cryptocarya spp. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Leaves were dried at 40°C and milled prior to solvent extraction. Solvents used for extraction and ﬂash chromato- graphy were of AnalaR® grade, whilst those used in HPLC analysis and sample preparation were of HPLC grade, and were from Mallinckrodt (St Louis, MO, USA). HPLC-grade water (18 mΩ) was prepared using a Barnstead (Dubuque IA, USA) E-pure system. Sample preparation. In order to obtain a rapid and cheap protocol by which to prepare extracts of leaves of C. moschata, a liquid–liquid extraction method was devel- oped to extract and clean up the samples. Milled leaves (120 mg) were weighed into a centrifuge tube and extracted with 4.0 mL of petroleum ether (60–68°C boil- ing point) for 30 min with sonication, followed by the addition of 4.0 mL of methanol:10% aqueous acetic acid (1:1, v/v) and sonication for a further 30 min. The result- ing mixture was stirred and centrifuged at 1200 g for 15 min and an aliquot (1.0 mL) taken from hydro- alcoholic phase, ﬁltered on a 0.45 µm PTFE membrane and submitted to HPLC analysis by injection of 20 µL. Isolation and identiﬁcation of ﬂavonoid glycoside stand- ards. Powdered leaf material (400 g) was extracted with methanol:10% aqueous acetic acid (1:1, v/v) for 60 min with sonication. The crude extract (15 g) was washed with petroleum ether (60–80°C boiling point) to remove the lipophilic compounds, and the residue (10 g) was dis- solved in methanol:10% aqueous acetic acid (1:1, v/v) and fractioned by ﬂash chromatography over RP18 (40– 63 µm) eluted using a step gradient from methanol:1% aqueous acetic acid (1:1, v/v) to pure methanol. Sub- fractions were submitted to preparative HPLC using a Supelcosil (Belleforte, PA, USA) LC18 column (250 × 22 mm i.d.; 12 µm) eluted with methanol:1% aqueous acetic acid (3:7, v/v) to yield six ﬂavonoid glycosides (F1– F6, Fig. 1) that were identiﬁed by comparison of their UV and 1H- and 13C-NMR data (Table 1) with those pre- viously published (Agrawal, 1989). INTRODUCTION Cryptocarya moschata Nees is an arboreal species of some 25–30 m height that is widely spread in the Atlan- tic forests of Brazil. It is recognised as an important food source for primates such as Brachyteles arachnoids E. Geoffroy, 1806 (mono-carvoeiro or muriqui). A study of the genetic structure of four natural populations of this species, using isoenzyme markers, showed a high level of genetic diversity when compared with other tropical angiosperm trees. The intra-populational genetic vari- ability was found to be more prominent than that exhib- ited between populations, and the estimated gene ﬂow corroborated the pronounced divergence found among populations (Moraes et al., 1999). Phytochemical studies of the bark of C. moschata have shown that styrylpyrones are the typical secondary meta- bolites present in this species (Cavalheiro and Yoshida, 2000). Flavonoid glycosides, as well as styrylpyrones, have been detected in leaves, and the qualitative and quantita- tive intra-speciﬁc variability of these secondary meta- bolites has also been determined (Nehme at al., 2002). In this paper, a protocol of extraction, clean-up and HPLC analysis is described that may be employed to establish simultaneously the ﬂavonoid and styrylpyrone proﬁles of the leaves of C. moschata with the aim of identifying chemotypes related to these metabolites. EXPERIMENTAL Materials. Plant material of Cryptocarya moschata was collected in the Carlos Botelho State Park (São Miguel 94 C. J. NEHME ET AL. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Phytochem.

FLAVONOID GLYCOSIDES AND STYRYLPYRONES FROM CRYPTOCARYA SPP. 95 Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Phytochem. Anal. 16: 93–97 (2005) Styrylpyrone standards. Standards of the styrylpyrones cryptomoscatones E3 (S1), D1 (S2), D2 (S3), F1 (S4) and E1 (S6), and cryptofolione (S7) (Fig. 1) were obtained previously from bark of C. moschata (Cavalheiro and Yoshida, 2000). Deacetylcryptocaryalactone (S5) and goniothalamin (S8) were obtained by ﬂash chromato- graphy and preparative HPLC of hydromethanolic ex- tracts of C. moschata and C. aschersoniana, respectively, and identiﬁed by UV and NMR data. Instrumentation. A Varian (Palo Alto, CA, USA) ProStar system consisting of a ternary pump model 240, a diode array detector model 330 and an auto-sampler model 410 was employed, controlled by a Star chroma- tography workstation (version 5.3). The column used was a Supelcosil (Belleforte, PA, USA) LC18 (250 × 4.6 mm i.d.; 5 µm) protected by a corresponding guard-column (20 × 4.6 mm i.d.). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Sample extraction and clean-up The protocol for sample extraction and clean-up was evaluated for efﬁciency of extraction and reproducibil- ity of retention time and peak area. The same sample was submitted four times to the extraction procedure as de- scribed above and the experiment was carried out in trip- licate. The efﬁciency of extraction with respect to each chromatographic peak was calculated by considering as 100% the total of all four of the peak areas obtained for that compound following analysis of the four extractions (Table 1 and Fig. 2). In the ﬁrst extraction, the yield cor- responding to the 12 main peaks was 86.0 ± 3.3%. No ﬂavonoid glycosides or styrylpyrones were detected in the petroleum ether phase showing the high selectivity of the liquid–liquid extraction step that was used to eliminate lipophilic components. Development of the chromatographic protocol In a previous paper (Nehme et al., 2002) the intraspeciﬁc variability of secondary metabolites in leaves of C. moschata was determined using a Shimpack (Southall, UK) C18 column (15 × 0.46 cm i.d.) eluted with phos- phoric acid–triethylamine (pH 2.0; solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) with a linear gradient from 85:15 (A:B) to 60:40 in 45 min followed by isocratic elution with 60:40 (A:B) for 10 min, at a ﬂow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Analysis of the UV spectra obtained from each chroma- tographic peak by PAD, together with retention time (tR) values of standards, showed the presence of ﬂavonoid glycosides (tR between 12 and 21 min) and styrylpyrones (tR between 26 and 38 min.). The three main peaks were identiﬁed as quercitrin (tR = 20.70 min), cryptomoscatone D2 (tR = 28.90 min) and cryptofolione (tR = 34.73 min). However, under these chromatographic conditions sev- eral peaks remained unresolved (Nehme et al., 2002). In order to improve the resolution, a longer (25 cm) C18 column was employed with the elution conditions as described above except for the ﬂow rate, which was 1.0 mL/min. The chromatogram obtained in these condi- tions showed 20 well-resolved peaks, with the ﬂavonoids grouped from 12 to 20 min, and the styrylpyrones grouped from 24 to 36 min. In addition, at least two un- resolved peaks between 22 and 25 min were tentatively attributed to aporphine alkaloids based on UV spectra (Fig. 3). These chromatographic conditions permitted the analysis of three classes of secondary metabolites in the polar extracts of leaves from C. moschata. The identities of the main peaks was established by comparison of tR values and UV spectra with standards together with co-injection studies. In order to facilitate the identiﬁcation of peaks, a relative retention time with respect to quercitrin (as internal reference) was deter- mined for each peak (Table 2). The methodology was applied to analyse the second- ary metabolites in leaves of four species of Cryptocarya collected in the Atlantic rain forest in the state of São Paulo (Brazil). A comparison of the chromatographic proﬁles (Fig. 3) revealed that the pattern of ﬂavonoids with peaks between 16 and 22 min was very similar among the species with only quantitative differences. C. saligna and C. aschersoniana showed an intense peak for quercetin-3-O-β-d-galactopyranoside (F1) whilst C. saligna exhibited another intense peak (absent from the other species) at 24.7 min, attributed to an unidenti- ﬁed ﬂavonoid with absorptions at 220, 293 and 335 nm. In the chromatograms from extracts of C. mandioccana and C. moschata, the most intense ﬂavonoid peak was quercetin-3-O-α-D-rhamnopyranoside (F6). In addition, another unidentiﬁed ﬂavonoid, labelled as (F) with a tR of 24.8 min, in the chromatograms of C. mandioccana and C. moschata, showed UV spectra with absorptions at 203, 260 and 340 nm, which suggested the presence of the aglycone quercetin in this ﬂavonoid. An additional unidentiﬁed peak with a tR of 42.7 min in the chromato- gram of C. aschersoniana showed absorptions at 235, 267 and 362 nm, which were indicative of a dihydrochalcone. Furthermore, each species was shown to possess a dis- tinguishable proﬁle of styrylpyrones. Thus, C. moschata showed higher diversity in this class of compounds; C. aschersoniana showed only one intense peak with a UV spectra similar to styrylpyrone, which was assigned as goniothalamin (S8); C. mandioccana showed only small peaks from 24 to 36 min with UV spectra similar to the styrylpyrones found in C. moschata, and C. saligna ex- hibited no styrylpyrone peaks as based on UV spectra. All peaks labelled with (S) in the chromatogram in Fig. 3 had UV spectra very similar those from identiﬁed styrylpyrones. Figure 2.
