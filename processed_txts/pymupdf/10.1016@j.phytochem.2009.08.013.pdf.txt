This study provides evidence that the limonoid methyl angolensate (MA) is present at higher concentrations in K. ivorensis with symptoms of stem cankers rather than in the plants without symptoms. A rapid, sensitive and selective HPLC–ESI-MS/MS method (using selected reaction monitoring – SRM – mode) was developed for quantiﬁcation of MA in all aerials parts of such plants, with a good linearity over a range of 0.1–20.0 g/kg, with r2 > 0.996 ± 6.1%. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantiﬁcation (LOQ) were less than 0.03 g/kg and 0.08 g/kg, respectively. Relative Standard Deviations (RSDs) ranged from 1.7% to 19.2% for all matrices. While the MA concentration did not change in the stem bark, its amounts increased nearly fourfold in stems and by 20% in leaves, when plants with symptoms were compared with those without symptoms. These data suggest that MA plays a role in plant–pathogen interactions, probably as a phytoanticipin. � 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Mahogany trees are characterized by having a high quality hard wood, whose color is yellowish to reddish-brown. Its wood is extensively utilized by the timber industry, and historically, mahogany has been highly valued for centuries. Mahogany is di- rectly associated with Swietenia genera (Meliaceae), such as Swie- tenia mahogany (Cuban mahogany) and Swietenia macrophylla (Brazilian and Honduran mahogany), amongst others (Dünish and Rühmann, 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Gasparotto et al., 2001). However, reforestation programs involving S. macrophylla culti- vars for the Brazilian timber industry have been seriously damaged by attacks from the shoot borer Hypsipyla grandella (Ferreira et al., 2005). This has resulted in serious economic problems for Brazil which is the 4th leading producer of hardwoods worldwide (FAO, 2008). In an attempt to avoid such consequences in the future, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation – Embrapa – has been evaluating changing cultivars of S. macrophylla for trees from the Khaya genus (African mahogany, Meliaceae) over the last decade. Such plants exhibit excellent growth properties, and they are not affected by the shoot borer H. grandella (Ferreira et al., 2005). Re- cently, however, Khaya trees found in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, were infected by a new microbial pathogen. The probable microorgan- ism involved was identiﬁed as Botryosphaeria rhodina, based on morphology, DNA sequences (ITS-1, ITS-2; GenBank EU276018) and pathological data (Niekerk et al., 2004; Slippers et al., 2007; Wet et al., 2008). Infection takes place either through wounds, or directly through the stomata and other openings. These fungi can then persist in healthy tissue. Successful infection and susceptibil- ity of infected trees are closely linked to environmental conditions, where high temperatures, water logging and other forms of stress favor infection, causing stem and branch cankers and dieback. Re- sprouting of the plants, followed by repeated infection, generally results in the development of numerous side branches and conse- quently in badly formed trees (Fig. 1), unsuitable for timber pro- duction, and in some cases tree death. The Khaya genus is a rich source of limonoids with a wide vari- ety of structural types (Olmo et al., 1996, 1997; Ferreira et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2008). Apart from the limonoids other constit- uents were also reported for various plants of Khaya, as some pen- tacyclic triterpenes, cycloartanes, sterols, sesquiterpenes, ﬂavonoids and coumarins (Banerji and Nigam, 1984). However, none of these compounds have been implicated in defense re- sponses to a speciﬁc disease in Khaya species. In a previous work, 0031-9422/$ - see front matter � 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 2027–2033 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Phytochemistry journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/phytochem Khaya ivorensis with and without symptoms of stem and branch cankers, caused by B. rhodina, were examined in order to deter- mine whether secondary metabolites present in the plant were produced or accumulated as chemical defense (Reche, 2007; Mar- inho, 2007). These studies gave some preliminary evidence that the limonoid methyl angolensate (MA 1, Fig. 2) was present at higher concentrations in K. ivorensis with symptoms of stem and branch cankers than in those without symptoms. Therefore, HPLC–ESI- MS/MS by the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was em- ployed to develop a speciﬁc and sensitive method for quantifying MA (1) in all aerial parts of plants. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Method development and speciﬁcity A screening by HPLC–ESI-MS was ﬁrst carried out to check whether compounds other than MA (1) were associated with K. ivorensis infection (see Supplementary material). In an attempt to establish a suitable method for detection and quantiﬁcation of MA (1) in different parts of K. ivorensis, the stems, stem bark, and leaves from plants with and without symptoms of stem and branch cankers, caused by B. rhodina, were analyzed by HPLC– ESI-MS/MS using the SRM mode. Investigations, therefore, ini- tially focused on establishing the best extraction and separation conditions for MA (1), and the conditions identiﬁed included ultrasound bath-assisted extraction for 10 min, using ethanol as extracting solvent. Separation of MA (1) was rather difﬁcult, since it often exists as a complex mixture of related limonoids of similar polarity. However, HPLC–ESI-MS/MS using the SRM mode have a number of advantages, including speed of analysis, high sensitivity, wide applicability combined with a good toler- ance toward contaminants, and the ability to analyze complex mixtures (Severino et al., 2009). Therefore, the crude ethanol ex- tracts of the stems, stem bark, and leaves from plants with and without symptoms of stem and branch cankers were re-dissolved in methanol and analyzed by LC–APCI-MS/MS. The mobile phase was determined after testing different compositions of solvents. A good chromatographic resolution was achieved using a gradi- ent H2O, MeOH and iso-PrOH, each one supplemented with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid. This mobile phase provided both excel- lent separation between MA (1) and related compounds, and good ionization levels under the APCI ion source. The SRM tran- sitions were chosen on the basis of the stability of product ions obtained under collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS/MS and also on the basis of interfering compounds from the matrixes. The standard MA (1) used in this study was isolated from the stem of K. ivorensis, and it was identiﬁed on the basis of spectro- scopic data, and by comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum with those from the literature (Olmo et al., 1997). The second-genera- tion product ion spectrum of MA (1) showed a protonated mol- ecule ([M+H+]) at m/z 471 and some fragments (Fig. 3). Even when the collision energy was high enough to reduce the inten- sity of m/z 471 to less than 5% of the base peak, no other signif- icant transitions were observed (Fig. 3A). The product ions chosen m/z 471 ? 453, m/z 471 ? 439, and m/z 471 ? 411 (Fig. 3), to perform the transitions in SRM mode during the development and application of this method, provided an excel- lent speciﬁcity of the method as shown by the SRM chromato- grams of Fig. 4. The standard addition is recommended for conditions in which the matrix without the analytes cannot be used for preparing the calibration solutions. Thus, calibration curves were made by spiking MA (1) in blank tested samples of leaves, stem bark and stems. The most concentrated point in the spiked stem bark analytical curve exhibited a lower ioniza- tion level (expressed by SRM peak area) than the same point in leaves or even in stems. Stems also exhibit the lower concentra- tion of endogenous MA (1) (Fig. 4). 2.2. Linearity and sensitivity The calibration curves by spiking MA (1) in blank tested sam- ples of leaves, stem bark and stems showed an excellent linearity at a 0.1–20.0 g/kg concentration range, with a correlation coefﬁ- cient above 0.996 ± 6.1% (Table 1) for all curves (Fig. 5). In addition, homoscedasticity tests were performed on each matrix in order to conﬁrm the above linearity. According to Almeida et al. (2002), this test should be performed in each linear regression analysis. Exper- imental F-values (1.34 � 108 for stems, 4.66 � 109 for stem bark and 5.17 � 107 for leaves) clearly indicated that homoscedasticity was not met for a conﬁdence interval of 99% since these values should be lower than 19 (Almeida et al., 2002). Therefore, it was necessary to employ weighting factors for each calibration curve. Such factors were empirically chosen and they were determined according to the lower values of percentage relative errors, ex- tracted from graphics in which residuals are plotted against con- centration. For all blank tested samples of leaves, stem bark and Fig. 1. Disease evolution on Khaya ivorensis: (A) After invasion, the pathogen induces formation of small cankers; (B), (C) and (D) during disease progression in the stem, the stem bark sheds off the infected region and new cankers appear; (E) Nodes are created, promoting re-sprouting of the plants. Fig. 2. Chemical structure of methyl angolensate (MA, 1). 2028 K.V.G. Reche et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 2027–2033 stems a weighting factor of 1/x2 provided the best results (Fig. 6). Analyzing such plots it is possible to realize that the maximum percentage relative errors were fewer than ±20%. This is in accor- dance with those results usually accepted for quantiﬁcation of ana- lytes in vegetal matrices (Gilbert and Anklam, 2002). Therefore, by adjusting weighting factors it was possible to achieve a good line- arity over a range of 0.1–20.0 g/kg. The limits of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) for MA (1) were 3.37 ± 3.6, 3.86 ± 1.0 and 4.41 ± 3.9 ng/mL for leaves, stems, and stem bark, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) were determined at 1.01 ± 4.6, 1.16 ± 0.9 and 1.32 ± 3.8 ng/mL for leaves, stems, and stem bark, respectively, reﬂecting high sensitivity of the proposed method (Table 1). 2.3. Precision and accuracy The intra- and inter-day precisions were assessed using the data of six different concentration of spiking MA (1) in blank tested samples of leaves, stem bark and stems, analyzed over a 5-day per- iod. The results are given in Table 2 and are expressed as Relative Standard Deviations (RSDs). The accuracy evaluated from back cal- culation was determined as the percent deviation between the amount found and the amount added of standard at the six con- centrations examined. However, they were expressed in Table 2 as relative errors, whose values should not vary up to ±20% during the quantiﬁcation process (Gilbert and Anklam, 2002). RSDs values (Table 2) ranged from 1.7 to 19.2% and relative errors from �18.9% Fig. 3. Product ion spectra of MA (1) obtained under CID-MS/MS: (A) 25 eV, 471 [M+H]+, Anal.

Recovery Percentage relative recovery of 80.7%, 89.8% and 29.4% for MA (1) were acquired in blank tested samples of stems, stem bark and leaves, respectively, and they showed RSD ranging from 4.1% to 10.7%, 7.2% to 18.4% and 6.2% to 18.8% (n = 5), respectively (Ta- ble 3). Thus, the proposed method can be considered suitable for quantiﬁcation MA (1) on stems and stem bark. These data suggest that a more selective extraction of MA (1) is necessary during its evaluation on leaves of K. ivorensis. However, the main proposal of this work was to develop a rapid and efﬁcient method for detec- tion and quantiﬁcation of MA (1) in different parts of K. ivorensis plants, employing an extraction step which could be used for stems, stem bark and leaves at the same time. Thus, the proposed method can be considered suitable for quantiﬁcation of MA (1) on plant material. Apparently, no ion suppression occurs when leaves are analyzed, since both RSDs and relative errors evaluated during precision and accuracy steps were smaller than those obtained for stems and stem bark (Table 2). So far, it appears that nothing has been reported on the current literature concerning quantiﬁcation of MA (1) on any plant species. This fact certainly makes difﬁcult a comparison between recovery Fig. 5. Analytical curves obtained for each matrix. Fig. 6.

Therefore, a concise HPLC–ESI-MS/MS method, in which both time-consuming and la- bor tasks could be avoided, should be preferred rather than employing different extraction and clean-up procedures for differ- ent matrices. 2.5. Method application to K. ivorensis plants with and without symptoms of stems and branch cankers, caused by B. rhodina The HPLC–ESI-MS/MS method has been applied to quantiﬁca- tion of MA (1) in the stems, stem bark, and leaves from plants of K. ivorensis with and without symptoms of stem cankers, caused by B. rhodina (Fig. 7). MA (1) in the samples was expressed as g/ kg of stems, bark, or leaves. MA (1) was found in all samples. The concentration of MA (1) in stem bark without symptoms of stem cankers was 1.86 g/kg ±5.5%, and similar proportions were present in those with symptoms, 1.61 g/kg ±16.7%. On the other hand, MA (1) was observed in markedly higher concentration in stems with symptoms (1.23 g/kg ±8.0%) than in those without symptoms (0.34 g/kg ±10.4%). These data suggest that MA (1) plays a role in plant–pathogen interaction, probably as a phytoanticipin (Griebel and Zeier, 2008; Pedras et al., 2005; Adesogan and Taylor, 1967). Biosynthesis of such a metabolite might represent a plant defense strategy in response to the pathogen attack, since this compound is reported to have antimicrobial activity (Chiruvella et al., 2007; Abdelgaleil et al., 2004). MA (1) was also observed in higher concentrations in leaves with symptoms (4.3 g/kg ±0.44%) than in those without symptoms (3.28 g/kg ±0.294%). Thus, assuming that MA (1) acts as a phytoan- ticipin, such behavior could be understood as a chemical-signaling for the whole plant. Increasing MA (1) concentration in leaves, the plant might prevent additional infection by avoiding pathogen penetration into the stomata. However, it is premature to draw any conclusions about the role of MA (1) in plant–pathogen inter- action until isolated MA (1) can be evaluated in direct bioassays with B. rhodina, which is currently in progress. 3. Conclusions A HPLC–ESI-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the determination of the limonoid MA (1) in different parts of K. ivorensis plants with and without symptoms of stem cankers caused by B. rhodina. As expected, stem and leaves of symptomatic plants presented a larger concentration of MA suggesting that this limonoid acts as a good barrier for the growth of B. rhodina. These data stimulated an investigation of MA (1) as B. rhodina inhibitor. Experiments on the dose–response of B. rhodina to MA (1) are in progress. 4. Experimental 4.1. General experimental procedures All organic solvents used were of analytical grade and pur- chased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and for LC–APCI–MS/ MS they were HPLC grade purchased from JT Baker (Ecatepec, Mex- ico); prior to use they were ﬁltered through a polytetraﬂuoroethyl- ene (PTFE) membrane Millipore ﬁlter (0.45 m) and degassed by sonication for 15 min. Water puriﬁed (18 M<OMEGA>) by a reverse osmosis Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used for all solutions. All specimens were separately dried in an air circular oven (Tecnal, TE-394/3, Piracicaba, Brazil), powdered using a mill (Tecnal, TE-340, Piracicaba, Brazil) and granular sizes were homog- enized using a granular sieve (75 m; 200 mesh), (Tecnal TE-631, São Paulo, Brazil). Liquid chromatography coupled with atmo- sphere pressure chemical ionization and tandem mass spectrome- try data (LC–APCI–MS/MS) were obtained using an Alliance 2695 liquid chromatography, and mass spectral data were acquired in positive ion mode on a triple quadrupole Micromass Quattro LC spectrometer (Manchester, UK), equipped with a Z-Spray API ion source and a megaﬂow electrospray probe. All MS data were ac- quired and processed using MassLynx V4.1 software (Waters, Cheshire, United Kingdom), with processed charts constructed using Origin 6.0 software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA, USA). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) (1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100 MHz). 4.2. Plant material K. ivorensis plants with and without symptoms of stem cankers, caused by B. rhodina, were collected on October 15th 2006 at the Cacao Research Experimental Unit (CEPLAC), Experimental Forest Station ‘‘Sosthenes de Miranda” (ESOMI), located in São Sebastião da Posse city in Bahia State, Brazil. Plant collection was supervised by Dr. Manfred Willy Müller from CEPLAC (BH4863). 4.3. Extraction procedure Individually, stem bark, stems and leaves of K. ivorensis plants with and without symptoms of stem cankers were powdered and granular sizes were homogenized using a granular sieve (75 m; 200 mesh). From homogenized ground stem bark, stems and leaves 50.0 ± 1.0 mg were ultrasound bath-assisted extracted three times for 10 min using ethanol as extracting solvent. Crude ethanolic ex- tracts were obtained after ﬁltration through a polytetraﬂuoroethyl- ene (PTFE) membrane Millipore ﬁlter (0.45 m). The samples were diluted affording solutions of 1 ppm. Aliquot of 60 lL of each sam- ple was evaporated to dryness by vacuum (Savant SpeedVac Plus CS 10A, São Paulo, Brazil) at 42 �C for two hours, affording the con- centrated extract. The dry residues were reconstituted in MeOH (1 mL) for HPLC–ESI-MS/MS analysis. 4.4. Extraction and isolation of methyl angolensate standard Ground stems (1.4 kg) from healthy K. ivorensis were extracted with hexane, then CH2Cl2 and ﬁnally with MeOH, at room temper- ature, three times. The concentrated hexane extract (30 g) was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel (70– 230 mesh) under vacuum. Elution with hexane–EtOAc gradient yielded four fractions. Puriﬁcation of fraction 4 was carried out Fig. 7.

Reche et al. / Phytochemistry 70 (2009) 2027–2033 2031 by applying it to an ODS (C18) SPE cartridge. The solvent was re- moved from the cartridge under vacuum. The eluent was evapo- rated and re-suspended in MeOH and subjected to Reversed phase-HPLC (H2O–MeOH 28:72; detection, UV 217 nm, ﬂow rate, 4.7 mL min�1, Phenomenex Gemini C18 column, 250 � 10 mm i.d.) yielding MA 1 (24.8 mg) and other limonoids. 4.5. Calibration standard and analytical curves A stock solution of MA (1) at 1000 lg/mL was prepared in HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, Ecatepec, Mexico) and working solutions at 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 ng/mL were prepared by serial dilu- tion. Individually, stem bark, stems and leaves concentrated ex- tract (prepared as described in Section 4.3) were reconstituted in 1 mL of such working solutions for HPLC–ESI-MS/MS analysis. Then, MA (1) in the samples expressed as g/kg of stems, stem bark, or leaves were 0.1, 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, 20.0 g/kg. All calibration standard curves were obtained in triplicate. The dynamic range used was from 5 to 1000 ng/mL (0.1–20 g/kg) for all analyzed curves. Calibration curves were obtained by plotting concentration (ng/mL and g/kg) in axis x per area below SRM peaks (arbitrary units) in axis y. 4.6. HPLC and MS parameters LC–APCI–MS/MS data were acquired using a Luna ODS analyti- cal column (150 � 4.6 mm i.d., 5 m, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), samples (20 lL) were injected into the analytical column un- der a ﬂow rate of 0.4 mL/min, the column was maintained at 20 �C in all runnings; the gradient elution system consisted of the follow- ing steps (H2O, MeOH and iso-PrOH in lines A, B and C respectively, each one supplemented with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid, TFA): a gra- dient elution starting at 70:30:0 (A:B:C) and varying linearly to 10:90:0 (A:B:C) for 25 min; then, a new linear variation was em- ployed varying from 10:90:0 (A:B:C) to 0:100:0 (A:B:C) for 30 min; the column was then washed with a new linear variation from 0:100:0 (A:B:C) to 0:90:10 (A:B:C) for 35 min, and re-condi- tioned with 70:30:0 (A:B:C) for 5 min; a ﬂow rate of 0.4 mL/min was used for the analysis; mass spectral data were acquired in po- sitive ion mode; nitrogen was used for nebulizatioin (12 L h�1) and desolvation (820 L h�1); the capillary voltage was set at 3.27 kV and the sample and the extractor cones at 32 and 5 V respectively; argon (Ar) was used for the product ions experiments (CID-MS). For SRM experiments, the cone voltage was maintained using tune parameters previously optimized for all compounds at 32 V, and three transitions were selected: m/z 471 ? 453 and m/z 471 ? 439 (monitoring) and m/z 471 ? 411 (quantiﬁcation), using a collision energy (CE) of 15 eV. The dwell time was 0.3 s, and the interscan delay was 0.02 s. The collision gas pressure (argon) was set at 1.40 e�3 mbar for all experiments. Software: All MS data were acquired and processed using Mass- Lynx V4.1 software (Waters, Cheshire, United Kingdom). 4.7. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantiﬁcation (LOQ) Individually, stem bark, stems and leaves concentrated extract (prepared as described in Section 4.3) were reconstituted in 1 mL of MeOH and limits of detection (LOD) were performed using the signal-to-noise ratio – 3/1 criterion. Limits of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) were established analyzing the same standard samples with serial diluted solutions, and were considered as the concentration at which the method is able to quantify the substance with accept- able accuracy and precision, i.e. with relative standard deviation (RSDs) and 20% variability. The limits were tested by injecting standard samples replicating each injection at least three times. 4.8. Speciﬁcity, linearity, precision, and accuracy Speciﬁcity was assessed by using three different transitions for quantiﬁcation of MA (1) in the SRM mode. Linearity was achieved by coefﬁcients of determination (r2) of analytical curves prepared as described in Section 4.5. Linearity studies of these curves were also accomplished using homoscedas- ticity test according to Almeida et al. (2002). Precision and accuracy were evaluated by individual analyses of stem bark, stems and leaves concentrated extract (prepared as de- scribed in Section 4.3) reconstituted in 1 mL of working solutions of MA (1) at 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 ng/mL (or expressed as g/kg of stems, stem bark, or leaves: 0.1, 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, 20.0 g/ kg). Each concentration was analyzed on ﬁve non-consecutive days. The results are given in Table 2 and are expressed as Relative Standard Deviations (RSDs). The accuracy evaluated from back cal- culation was determined as the percent deviation between amount found and amount added of standard at the six concentrations examined, but expressed as relative errors in Table 2. 4.9. Recovery A stock solution of MA (1) at 1000 lg/mL was prepared in HPLC grade methanol (JT Baker, Ecatepec, Mexico) and working solutions of 6.0, 600.0 and 900 ng/mL were prepared by serial dilution. Then, aliquots of each solutions (1.0 mL) were added individually to powdered stem bark, stems and leaves (50 ± 1.0 mg) from K. ivor- ensis plant without symptoms of stem cankers, and dried under N2 ﬂow for 2 h. Thereafter, samples were submitted to solvent extraction as described in Section 4.3. Each sample was evaporated to dryness by vacuum (Savant SpeedVac Plus CS 10A, São Paulo, Brazil) at 42 �C for two hours, affording the spiked quality controls (QCs). The dry residues were reconstituted in MeOH (1 mL) for HPLC–ESI-MS/MS analysis. Recoveries were calculated by compar- ing spiked quality controls (QCs) with directly-extracted QCs at same concentrations. SRM areas of each quality control were di- rectly compared with spiked quality controls (ﬁvefold for each one). Concentrations of low (LQC), medium (MQC) and high quality controls (HQC) were set at 6.0 ng/mL (0.16 g/kg), 600 ng/mL (12.0 g/kg) and 900 ng/mL (18.0 g/kg), respectively.
