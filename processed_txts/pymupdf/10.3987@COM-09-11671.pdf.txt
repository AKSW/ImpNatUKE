The structures of these  compounds were identified by IR, UV, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, gHSQC  and gHMBC spectral analysis and comparison of data from the literature.  Conchocarpus gaudichaudianus, a tree, is used by the aboriginal natives in northern Brazil.1 Of the 45  species in the genus Conchocarpus, only C. heterophyllus, C. inopinatus and C. paniculata have been  investigated by spectroscopic analysis. Extracts from leaves of C. heterophyllus and the dichloromethane  fraction of C. inopinatus show in vitro trypanocidal activity2,3 and C. paniculata exhibits molluscicidal  activity.4   Indolopyridoquinazoline type alkaloids, like rutaecarpine isolated from Evodia rutaecarpa, shows a  variety of pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory5 antithrombotic and vasorelaxant effects.6  We report studies on the stems of C. gaudichaudianus, which afforded three new indoloquinazolone  alkaloids (1, 2 and 3) and one 2-quinolone alkaloid (6).  HETEROCYCLES, Vol. 78, No. 8, 2009 2053   The methanol extract from stems of Conchocarpus gaudichaudianus yielded six alkaloids 1 - 6, including  the known N-trans-coumaroyltyramine (4) and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (5).    Figure 1. Compounds from Conchocarpus gaudichaudianus    The molecular formula of compound (1) was established to be C23H21N3O3 by analysis of its HR-MS  (ESI) [m/z: 410.1519 (M+Na)+] and NMR data (Table 1). IR spectrum showed absorption of a tertiary  amide function at 1660 cm-1. The UV results (see Experimental) were also in agreement with a highly  aromatic conjugation system. The 1H NMR spectrum (300 MHz) of 1 showed two symmetrical triplets at  δ 4.13 and δ 3.02, corresponding to protons H-7 and H-8, an NH indolic group at δ 10.44, and six  aromatic hydrogens at δ 6.56 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, H-11); 7.08 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, H-12) and at δ 7.19 (d, J = 8.1 Hz,  H-1); 7.65 (td, J = 8.1 and 1.3 Hz, H-2); 7.21 (t, J = 8.1 Hz, H-3); 7.95 (dd, J = 8.1 and 1.3 Hz, H-4). The  presence of a 2,2-dimethylchromene ring was evidenced by a methyl singlet at δ 1.35 integrating for six  hydrogens and two doublets H-9’ and H-10’ at δ 5.72 (d, J = 9.8 Hz, H-10’) and 7.28 (d, J = 9.8 Hz,  H-9’).  Full assignments of the hydrogens and protonated carbons of alkaloid 1 were attained by 1H-1H gCOSY  and 1H-13C heteronuclear correlated 2D NMR spectra (gHMQC). Also, by a hydrogen detected multiple  bond 1H-13C correlation spectrum (gHMBC) all of the quaternary carbon signals were assigned (Table 1).  Based on the above data and by comparison with data from goshuyuamide-II8 (3a) structure 1 was  4: R1 = H 5: R1 = OMe N O HO H OH  R1 6 5 N O Me OMe HO OH 6 7 8 9 10 2 4 3 1 4a 5 14a 1a 13a 13 7 8 8a 12a 12 10 13' 12' 10' 9' 1: R1 = H 2: R1 = OH 3: R1 = Me N O N N O O H R1 N N N O O H Me 9a 14 3a 1'  5'  4'  2'  10'  6'  2054 HETEROCYCLES, Vol. 78, No. 8, 2009   assigned to 3-(2-(7,7-dimethyl-3,7-dihydropyrano[3,2-e]indol-1-yl)ethyl)-1-hydroxyquinazoline-  2,4(1H,3H)-dione.  Compound (2) was obtained as a yellow oil. The UV spectrum of 2 showed it to be related to 1. In the IR  spectrum, the absorption at 3397 cm-1 indicated the presence of a hydroxyl group. Evidence for a  hydroxyl at N-14 was given by the mass spectrum, which exhibited a fragment at m/z 226 [m/z 404-178  (C15H16NO)] and 179 [m/z 404-225(C8H7N2O3)] and by correlation for a HN-13 at δ10.80 d, J=2.40 Hz  with H13a obtained by  1H-1H gCOSY.  The new alkaloid was therefore identified as  3-(2-(7,7-dimethyl-3,7-dihydropyrano[3,2-e]indol-1-yl)ethyl) -1-hydroxyquinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione.  Compound 3 differed from 1 by the presence of a methyl group at N-14. The correlation for methyl  protons with C-14a and C-1a, which indicated the location of the methyl group shown by the gHSQC and  gHMBC experiments and the signal at δ10.76 d, J=2.40 Hz, HN-13 and obtained by 1H-1H gCOSY. Thus,  the structure of the new alkaloid was characterized as 3-(2-(7,7-dimethyl-3,7-dihydropyrano[3,2-e]indol-  1-yl)ethyl) -1-methylquinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione.  The known N-trans-coumaroyltyramine (4) and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (5) were also isolated and  identified by 1H and 13C NMR, mass spectrometry, and comparison of published spectral data.9,10,11  Compound 6 was obtained as an amorphous yellow solid. The [α]D 0° obtained indicated that this  compound is a raceme mixture. Its UV and IR spectra showed the characteristic absorption of a  2-quinolones.9 The ESI-MSMS mass spectrum indicated the [M+H]+ at m/z 360 (base peak), and the  characteristic fragment ion of the 4-methoxy-1-methyl-2-quinolone alkaloids the [M+H]+ at m/z 203.12  The 1H NMR spectrum revealed the presence of two signals at δ 3.94 s and 3.69 s due to methoxyl and  N-methyl groups (Table 2), four aromatics at δ 7.84, (dd, J=7.8 and 1.5 Hz), 7.27, (td, J=7.8 and 0.9 Hz),  7.55, (td, J=7.8 and 1.5 Hz) and 7.38, (dd, J=7.8 and 0.9 Hz). There were two methyl singlets at δ 1.07,  thus placing an isopropyl group at the end of the side chain, and one signal at δ 1.80, br s, H-10’. The  observed signals for a hydroxyl-tertiary carbon at δ 72.8 and three methyl singlets at δH 1.07 (s, 6H), 1.80  (brs, 3H), a signal at δ 5.30 (td, J=6.6 and 1.1 Hz), 3.37 (d, J=6.6 Hz), in the 13C (Table 2) and 1H NMR,  and complete assignment of chemical shifts for all carbons, confirmed the presence of a  3’,7’-dimethyl-6’,7’dihydroxy-2’-octenyl chain. Using the prenylquinoline alkaloid11 as a model, the  structure of this new alkaloid was established as (E)-3-(6,7-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyloct-2-enyl)-4-  methoxy-1-methylquinolin-2(1H)-one.    EXPERIMENTAL    General  HETEROCYCLES, Vol. 78, No. 8, 2009 2055   The NMR spectra were obtained in BRUKER DRX400 (9.4 T) and VARIAN GEMINI300 (7.05 T)  spectrophotometers, using TMS as the internal standard. For gHMBC the coupling constants were  optimized for 4, 6, 8 and 12 Hz. IR: film NaCl plates; High-resolution ESI-MS were recorded on a  Micromass Q-Tof mass spectrometer, ESI-MSMS: low resolution on a triple quadrupole were recorded  on a Micromass Quattro LC instrument equipped with a “Z-spray” ion source, and EI-MS on a  CG/EM-SHIMADZU QP 2000 A. CC: silica gel 60 (70-230 and 230-400 mesh); TLC: silica gel plates  F254 (0.25 mm in thickness).    Plant Material  The aerial parts of Conchocarpus gaudichaudianus subsp. bahiensis were collected in Itacaré, Bahia,  Brazil, in February 1993. The specimen was identified by Dr. Jose Pirani from the Department of Botany  of the University of São Paulo, Brazil, and the voucher herbarium specimen was deposited in this  University.    Extraction and Isolation  The stems (200 g) from Conchocarpus gaudichaudianus were exhaustively extracted with MeOH at rt,  and the extract was evaporated in vacuo to yield 3.8 g. The extract was submitted to vacuum  chromatography over a silica gel support and eluted with n-hexane, n-hexane-CHCl3 (1:1), CHCl3,  CHCl3-EtOAc (1:1), EtOAc, and MeOH, giving 11 fractions. Fraction 8 (480 mg) was chromatographed  over a gel filtration Sephadex LH-20 column using MeOH and MeOH-CHCl3 (1:1) successively to give 1  (1.0 mg), 2 (4.8 mg) and 3 (1.2 mg). Fraction 9 (520 mg) was twice chromatographed (Sephadex LH-20  MeOH and MeOH-CHCl3 (1:1); then silica gel, hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient) to give  compounds 1 (2.8 mg), 4 (5.3 mg) and 5 (6.8 mg). Fraction 2 (1.82 g) was chromatographed on silica gel  columns (hexane-CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH gradient solvents) to yield Fr 89 (540 mg), and was purified by  Sephadex LH-20 eluting with MeOH and MeOH-CHCl3 (1:1) respectively to yield the majority  compound 6 (340 mg).    3-(2-(7,7-Dimethyl-3,7-dihydropyrano[3,2-e]indol-1-yl)ethyl)quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (1).
