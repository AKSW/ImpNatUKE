Research Article Enantioselective analysis of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol by CE with application to biotransformation studies employing endophytic fungi A CE method is described for the enantioselective analysis of propranolol (Prop) and 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH-Prop) in liquid Czapek medium with application in the study of the enantioselective biotransformation of Prop by endophytic fungi. The elec- trophoretic conditions previously optimized were as follows: an uncoated fused-silica capillary, 4% w/v carboxymethyl-b-CD in 25 mmol/L triethylamine/phosphoric acid (H3PO4) buffer at pH 9 as running electrolyte and 17 kV of voltage. UV detection was carried out at 208 nm. Liquid–liquid extraction using diethyl ether: ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v) as extractor solvent was employed for sample preparation. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 0.25–10.0 mg/mL for each 4-OH-Prop enantiomer and 0.10–10.0 mg/mL for each Prop enantiomer (rZ0.995). Within-day and between-day relative standard deviations and relative errors for precision and accuracy were lower than 15% for all the enantiomers. Finally, the validated method was used to evaluate Prop biotransformation in its mammalian metabolite 4-OH-Prop by some selected endophytic fungi. The screening of ﬁve strains of endophytic fungi was performed and all of them could biotransform Prop to some extent. Speciﬁcally, Glomerella cingulata (VA1) biotransformed 47.8% of (�)-(S)-Prop to (�)-(S)-4-OH-Prop with no formation of (1)-(R)- 4-OH-Prop in 72 h of incubation.

Furthermore, Prop is consumed in sports as a doping agent. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic proprieties of Prop enantiomers are quite different with the b-blocking activity predominantly related to (�)-(S)-Prop, which is about 100 times more potent than (1)-(R)-Prop [1, 2]. The major phase I mammalian metabolites of Prop include 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH-Prop), which also has equipo- tent b-receptor blocking action to the parent compound, N-desisopropylpropranolol, 1-naphthoxylactic acid and propranolol glycol [3]. In addition, Prop and its metabolites are known to undergo conjugation, producing mainly sulfates and partially glucuronide derivatives [4, 5] such as propranolol glucoronide and 4-hydroxypropranolol glucur- onide, which are the major phase II products [6–8]. Recently there has been a growing body of information about the use of biocatalysis for selective transformations of synthetic and natural products. The most important advantages of using biocatalysis in biotransformation processes are the relatively mild conditions of the proce- dures, environmental safety, and especially high selectivity. Many mammalian phase I and phase II metabolic reactions including hydroxylation, O and N dealkylation, dehy- drogenation, and glucuronide and sulfate conjugation also occur in microbial models [9]. So, the utilization of micro- bial systems as biomimetic models to predict the metabo- lism of drugs in humans and animals have received considerable attention [10–13]. Endophytic fungi are proliﬁc producers of natural products, since they live inside the health plant tissues Keyller Bastos Borges1 Moˆ nica Tallarico Pupo2 Pierina Sueli Bonato1 1Department of Physics and Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeira˜o Preto, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Ribeira˜o Preto, Brazil 2Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeira˜o Preto, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Ribeira˜o Preto, Brazil Received April 1, 2009 Revised June 4, 2009 Accepted June 4, 2009 Abbreviations: 4-OH-Prop, 4-hydroxypropranolol; Acet, acetaminophen; CM-b-CD, carboxymethyl-b-cyclodextrin; I.S., internal standard; Prop, propranolol; TEA, triethylamine Correspondence: Dr. Pierina Sueli Bonato, Faculty of Pharma- ceutical Sciences of Ribeira˜o Preto, University of Sa˜o Paulo, Ribeira˜o Preto 14040-903, Brazil E-mail: psbonato@fcfrp.usp.br Fax: 155-16-3602-4880 & 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Endophytes have also been successfully used in the biotransformation of some compounds [16–22]. In addition, chemo-, region- and stereo- selective reactions employing fungi have been studied [23–26]. Since 4-OH-Prop is also biologically active, the study of its production by endophytic fungi can be useful to obtain gram quantities of Prop metabolites in the enantiomerically pure form via routine fermentation techniques [27, 28] and further accomplishment of clinical and/or toxicological studies. The purpose of the present study was to validate an enantioselective CE method for the simultaneous analysis of Prop and 4-OH-Prop in liquid Czapek medium to verify if some endophytic fungi might enantioselectivelly biotrans- form Prop to 4-OH-Prop. The enantioselective analysis of Prop in biological matrices by CE has been described in several papers using carboxymethyl-b-CD (CM-b-CD) [29, 30], other b-CD derivatives [31–33] or mixture of chiral selectors [34]. However, the simultaneous resolution of Prop and 4-OH-Prop has been described in only two papers [35, 36], one of them carried out recently by our group, using chemometric design to optimize the resolution of these drugs in standard solutions [36]. In addition, the simulta- neous determination of Prop and 4-OH-Prop enantiomers by CE to study the Prop biotransformation by endophytic fungi has not been reported. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Standard solutions and chemicals Prop (99%) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and 4-OH-Prop (98%) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Canada). Acet- aminophen (Acet, 98%) obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis) was used as internal standard (I.S.). Stock standard solutions of Prop and 4-OH-Prop were prepared in methanol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at concentrations of 8, 20, 40, 80, 160, 200, 400 and 800 mg/mL. The stock solution of I.S. was used at the concentration of 100.0 mg/mL. The standard solutions were stored at �201C in the absence of light. CM-b-CD was obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Triethylamine (TEA) was purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85% in water) was obtained from Labsynth (Diadema, Brazil). Sodium hydroxide was purchased from Nuclear (Diadema, Brazil). Diethyl ether was purchased from Mallinckrodt Baker (Paris, France) and ethyl acetate from Tedia (Fairﬁeld, OH, USA). Except for ethyl acetate and methanol which were HPLC grade, all other chemicals were of analytical grade in the highest purity available. Water was distilled and puriﬁed using a Millipore Milli-Q Plus system (Bedford, MA, USA). 2.2 Instrumentation and CE conditions Analyses were performed on an Agilent Technologies CE system (Waldbronn, Germany) model G1600A consisting of an analyzer, an automatic sampler and a diode array detector operating at 208 nm. Agilent ChemStation Software was used for data acquisition. An uncoated fused-silica capillary obtained from MicroSolv Technology Corporation (Eatontown, NJ, USA) of 50 mm id, 50.0 cm in total length, and 41.5 cm in effective length was used. Before the ﬁrst use, the capillary was conditioned by rinsing with 1.0 mol/L NaOH for 30 min, followed by water for 30 min at 251C. At the beginning of each working day, the capillary was rinsed with 0.1 mol/L NaOH for 10 min followed by water for 10 min. The capillary was rinsed with 1.0 mol/L NaOH for 0.5 min, 0.1 mol/L NaOH for 1.5 min, water for 1 min and running buffer for 2 min between consecutive analyses. After daily use, the capillary was washed with 0.1 mol/L NaOH for 10 min followed by water for 10 min. When not in use, the capillary was stored in water. The electrophoretic conditions previously optimized by Box-Behnken design [36] were as follows: 4% w/v CM-b-CD in 25 mmol/L TEA/ H3PO4 buffer at pH 9 as running electrolyte and 17 kV of voltage. UV detection was carried out at 208 nm. Sample injections were performed hydrodynamically at a pressure of 50 mbar for 20 s and the capillary temperature was set at 251C. All solutions used as CE running buffer and in CE Figure 1. Molecular structures of Prop. and 4-hydroxypropra- nolol enantiomers and aceta- minophen (internal standard).

KGaA, Weinheim www.electrophoresis-journal.com rinse cycle procedure were ﬁltered through a Millex-HA 0.45 mm disk ﬁlter from Millipore and degassed by ultrasound for 5 min. 2.3 Sample preparation Aliquots of 1 mL of liquid Czapek medium spiked with 25 mL of standard solutions of Prop, 4-OH-Prop and I.S. or samples obtained in the biotransformation process were alkalinized with 200 mL 2 mol/L NaOH solution and extracted with 4 mL diethyl ether: ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v). The tubes were capped and submitted to vortex mixing using a Vibrax VXR agitator (IKA, Staufen, Germany) for 10 min and then centrifuged at 1800 � g for 3 min. This liquid–liquid extraction system allowed up to 36 extractions at the same time. The upper organic phases (3 mL) were transferred to conical tubes and evaporated under compressed air. The residues were dissolved in 25 mL of the running buffer diluted 1:10 (running buffer with CD:puriﬁed water) and analyzed by CE. 2.4 Method validation To determine the extraction recovery, liquid Czapek medium samples (1 mL) were spiked with Prop and 4-OH- Prop enantiomers to obtain the concentrations of 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL for each enantiomer (n 5 3) and submitted to the extraction procedure. Another set of samples were prepared extracting 1 mL aliquots of liquid Czapek medium and then spiking the extract with the same amount of Prop and 4-OH-Prop enantiomers. Both samples were extracted, but only one was spiked before extraction. The recovery was determined by comparing both areas obtained. Calibrations curves were obtained by spiking aliquots of 1 mL liquid Czapek medium with standard solutions of rac-Prop and rac-4-OH-Prop to obtain enantiomer concen- trations in the range of 0.10–10.0 mg/mL and 0.25–10.0 mg/ mL, respectively. The I.S. was used in the concentration of 100 mg/mL. Enantiomer/I.S. peak area ratios were plotted against the drug concentrations to obtain the respective calibration graph. The data were then subjected to regres- sion analysis by the least-squares method to calculate the calibration equation and correlation coefﬁcient (r). The limit of quantiﬁcation of the method, deﬁned as the lowest enantiomer concentration that could be determined with accuracy and precision below 20% over six analytical runs, was obtained using liquid Czapek medium samples (1 mL, n 5 6) spiked at concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL of each Prop enantiomer and at concentrations of 0.25 mg/mL of each 4-OH-Prop enantiomer. The precision and accuracy of the method were eval- uated by within-day (n 5 6) and between-day (n 5 3) assays using liquid Czapek medium samples spiked with Prop and 4-OH-Prop at the concentrations of 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg/mL of each enantiomer. Precision and accuracy results obtained were expressed in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD, %) and relative error (E, %). The stability test of Prop and 4-OH-Prop was evaluated by studying the inﬂuence of freeze (�201C) and thaw (22721C) cycles, short-term room temperature (24 h on the bench-top) and 48 h stored at �201C. These periods corre- sponds to the maximum time that the samples were kept on the bench-top or frozen, respectively. Six replicates (n 5 6) of spiked liquid Czapek medium at the low (1.0 mg/mL) and high concentration (5.0 mg/mL) were prepared to perform the stability test. The peak areas obtained from the stability tests were compared to the peak areas obtained with freshly prepared samples. One-way ANOVA test was applied, with the level of signiﬁcance set at p-valuer0.05. The selectivity of the method was evaluated by analyzing sterile medium, sterile medium added of N,N-dimethyl- formamide and endophytic fungal mycelium under the conditions previously established. 2.5 Endophytic fungi isolation and maintenance The endophytic fungi used in the present study were previously isolated from the plants Tithonia diversifolia, Viguiera robusta and V. arenaria (Asteraceae). An initial screening of ﬁve strains was performed to evaluate if they were able to produce the 4-OH-Prop metabolite. The selected strains were Phomopsis sp. (TD2) isolated from T. diversifolia, Glomerella cingulata (VA1) isolated from V. arenaria, Penicillium crustosum (VR4), Chaetomium globosum (VR10) and Aspergillus fumigatus (VR12) isolated from V. robusta. All the fungi studied were isolated and identiﬁed by rDNA sequences as previously described [37, 38]. The fungi have been maintained as agar plugs in sterile water, in silica gel (six to 12 mesh, grade 40, desiccant activated) at 101C, and on potato dextrose agar slants and stored at 41C. The strains have been deposited in the Academic Laboratory of Industrial Enzimology of Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Ribeira˜o Preto (University de Sa˜o Paulo, Ribeira˜o Preto, Brazil). 2.6 Prop enantioselective biotransformation Three discs of 0.5 cm of diameter containing the fungal mycelia were aseptically transferred to 9.0 cm diameter Petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar and allowed to grow for 7 days at 251C. Three uniform discs of 0.5 cm mycelial diameter of each endophytic fungus studied were cut with a transfer tube (Fischer Scientiﬁc, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and then inoculated in 50 mL Falcon tubes containing 10 mL of pre-fermentative medium (10.0 g malt extract, 10.0 g dextrose, 5.0 g triptone and 3.0 g yeast extract and distilled water to 1 L and pH adjusted to 6.270.2 with a solution of 0.5 mol/L HCl), used for the growth of the microorganism. After three days the mycelium was completely transferred to 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing 100 mL of modiﬁed Electrophoresis 2009, 30, 3910–3917 3912 K. B. Borges et al. & 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.electrophoresis-journal.com Czapek medium (25.0 g sucrose, 2.0 g NaNO3, 1.0 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g MgSO4 � 7H2O, 0.5 g KCl, 0.01 g FeSO4 � 7H2O, and distilled water to 1.0 L, pH adjusted to 5.0 with a solution of 1.0 mol/L HCl). rac-Prop was added at this point using a stock solution in N,N-dimethylformamide that was ﬁlter-sterilized with a disposable 0.22 mm membrane ﬁlter Millipore (Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) and whose exact concentration was determined using the CE method. Quantiﬁcation was necessary due to drug loss by adsorption onto the ﬁlter matrix. The cultures were incubated for 72 h at 301C with shaking at 120 rpm in the darkness. Aliquots were ﬁltered through a Millipore membrane ﬁlter (0.45 mm) Millipore and then 1 mL of ﬁltrate was submitted to extraction procedure and analyzed by the method described in this paper. Control tubes consisted of culture broth without Prop and fungi, sterile medium with N,N-dimethylformamide, sterile medium with N,N-dimethylformamide and Prop, sterile medium with N,N-dimethylformamide and endo- phytic fungal mycelium (each endophytic fungus studied). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Method development and validation Box-Behnken design was previously applied in the optimi- zation of the simultaneous resolution of Prop and 4-OH- Prop, using a single chiral selector. The migration order was also previously established [36]. The enantioseparation was performed using an uncoated fused-silica capillary, 4% w/v CM-b-CD in 25 mmol/L TEA/H3PO4 buffer at pH 9 as running electrolyte and 17 kV of voltage. UV detection was carried out at 208 nm. The other conditions employed were hydrodynamic injections at a pressure of 50 mbar for 20 s and capillary temperature at 251C. The pairs of enantiomers and I.S. were well separated under the electrophoretic conditions employed, with Acet (I.S.) migrating at 12.6 min, (�)-(S)-4-OH-Prop at 13.3 min, (1)-(R)-4-OH-Prop at 13.7 min, (�)-(S)-Prop at 14.5 min and (1)-(R)-Prop at 14.9 min. Figure 2 shows the electro- pherograms of blank liquid Czapek medium (Fig. 2A) and liquid Czapek medium control spiked with Prop, 4-OH-Prop enantiomers and I.S. (Fig. 2B). Various solvents or mixture of solvents at different compositions were evaluated to extract the Prop and its metabolite from liquid Czapek medium employing LLE and the selected one was diethyl ether: ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v). Recoveries of (�)-(S)-4-OH-Prop and (1)-(R)-4-OH-Prop were approximately 67 and 68%, respectively. The recoveries for (�)-(S)-Prop and (1)-(R)-Prop were higher with values approximately of 87% for both enantiomers. The RSD for the enantiomers of both analytes were lower than 15%. Results are summarized in Table 1. Response ratio of peak areas between the corresponding enantiomer and the I.S. versus theoretical enantiomer concentrations was ﬁtted by a least-square linear regression. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 0.25–10.0 mg/mL for 4-OH-Prop enantiomers and Figure 2.

The correlation coefﬁcients for all analytes were (r)Z0.995 (Table 2). The lowest concentrations quantiﬁed by the validated method are presented in Table 2. The RSD (%) and E (%) were lower than 15%. Precision of a quantitative method is the degree of agreement among individual test results when the proce- dure is applied repeatedly to multiple samplings. It is measured by injecting repeatedly a ready-made sample pool and expressed as RSD (%) of the results. In addition, the accuracy of the method is deﬁned as the degree of agree- ment of test results generated by the method to the true value. Within-day (n 5 6) and between-day (n 5 3) precision and accuracy presented RSD (%) and E (%) lower than 15%. These results are shown in Table 3. To perform the stability test, spiked liquid Czapek medium were prepared in six replicates (n 5 6) at the low (1.00 mg/mL) and high concentration (5.00 mg/mL). These samples were analyzed freshly, after 24 h at room temperature (22721C), after 48 h frozen at �201C or after freeze/thaw cycles. As can be seen from the values, there were no statistically signiﬁcant loss since all p-values were 40.05 (one-way ANOVA, NS). Stability data are summar- ized in Table 4. The stability of Prop under the biotrans- formation conditions was evaluated by the analysis of a control tube consisting of sterile medium with N,N-dime- thylformamide and Prop. No degradation of Prop could be observed up to 72 h of incubation. All studied fungi did not produce any secondary meta- bolites that presented retention times close to those of Prop and 4-OH-Prop enantiomers (Fig. 3). 3.2 Enantioselective biotransformation of Prop by endophytic fungi In human liver microsomes, the ring hydroxylation of Prop is mediated by CYP2D6, whereas desisopropylation is mediated mainly by CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 [39]. Of these metabolites, the ring-hydroxylated products are of particular importance. 4-OH-Prop has been demonstrated to be equipotent to Prop as a b-receptor antagonist [40] and is believed to contribute to the bioactivity of Prop in humans [41]. The enantiomers of 4-OH-Prop, which were not present in the controls, were detected in the extracts of endophytic fungi culture medium obtained 72 h after the addition of Prop. Identiﬁcation of Prop and 4-OH-Prop enantiomers was made by comparison of CE migration times and diode array detection spectra with those of authentic reference compounds. The screening of ﬁve strains of endophytic fungi Phomopsis sp. (TD2), G. cingulata (VA1), P. crustosum (VR4), C. globosum (VR10) and A. fumigatus (VR12) were performed and all of them could biotransform Prop to Figure 3.

The concentrations of analytes were calculated considering the calibration curves for each enantiomer studied. The cultures were incubated for 72 h and the concentrations (and percentage of formation) of 4-OH-Prop enantiomers for each endophytic fungus studied are presented in Table 5. As can be seen the fungus G. cingulata (VA1) biotransformed 47.8% of (�)-(S)-Prop to (�)-(S)- 4-OH-Prop, the more active metabolite with no formation of (1)-(R)-4-OH-Prop metabolite in 72 h of incu- bation. Figure 4 shows the electropherograms of all endo- phytic fungi studied after 72 h of incubation. In general, (�)-(S)-4-OH-Prop was the metabolite preferentially formed by all endophytic fungi studied. Therefore, the production of a speciﬁc metabolite Prop in enantiomeric pure form could be assigned by selecting the appropriate fungus. 4 Concluding remarks A simple and suitable CE method was validated for the enantioselective determination of Prop and 4-OH-Prop simultaneously in liquid Czapek medium. All parameters evaluated are in accordance with the conﬁdence criteria established in the literature. This method was successfully employed to study the Prop biotransformation by endophytic fungi, proving that these microorganisms are a promising source of microorganisms that could be used to obtain 4-OH-Prop active metabolite in enantiomeri- cally pure form. The results reported here could be further used to obtain speciﬁc metabolites in higher quantities for pharmacodynamic, toxicological or other studies.
