SUMMARY:  Two new rosane diterpenes,  epoxicorcovadin  and epoxivellozin,  have been isolated from Vellozia candida Mikan: their structures  were  stablished by spectroscopic  data and chemical transformations.  Vellozia candida Mikan grows on the hillside of Corcovado mountain  and on the rocky mountains  of the coast of State of Rio de Janeiro.  We  have previously  reported the isolation of velloziolide  (1)' and of  three  rosane diterpenes'  from the hexane extract of the stem, roots and  leaf  sheaths of this plant.  The present paper describes  the structural  eluci-  dation of two new diterpenoids,  epoxicorcovadin  (2a) and epoxivellozin  (&),  -  isolated as minor components  from the same plant.  Epoxicorcovadin  (2a) was purified and characterized  as its acetate  -  derivative  (Zb).  2b CC  --  22H3804; m-p. 168-69Oc, [a]; 2 0.00 (c = 1.00 CHC13)13  possesses  as a characteristic  feature an a,?+unsaturated  ketone  moiety  (vc= 0 at 1668cm-' and A:,"$" at 253 nm).  The 'H NMR spectrum,  in  CDC13,  showed signals for four tertiary methyl groups  (0.98, 1.10, 1.18 and. 1.26 ppm),  a methyl group of an acetate  (2.09 ppm)  and one  tertiary vinyl group  at  5.67 ppm ( UT, dd., J=17 and 10 Hz).  The multiplet  signal (3H) between at 4.98  and 5.31 ppm (CH2, m) corresponds  to the methylene of the vinyl residue and  the acetyl carbinolic  proton.  Two doublets at 5.9 (lH, J=9 Hz)  and  7.45  ppm (lH, J=9 Hz) are due to the two olefinic protons u,3-conjugated  to the  carbonyl group, with the 3carbon  linked to a quaternary  carbon.  Double  irradiation  experiments  demonstrated  that these two protons are  mutually  spin coupled.  The absence of absorptions  in the IR spectrum for  hydroxyl  groups and the presence of two singlet signals at  64.3 and 68.4 ppm  in  13C NMR spectrum of 2b indicated that the remaining oxygen atom belongs to  -  an epoxide function.  These data, in combination  with the  comparative  analysis of the proton noise decoupled and single frequence  off-resonance  decoupled  13C NMR spectrum  (Table l), allowed expansion  of  the molecular  formula C22H3004  A  t0  (CO-CH=CH~)  (CHOAC) (--cH=cH~) (c  - --)  (cj3 (CH) (CH~)~  (CH~)~ and to deduce the structure  2&,  which was confirmed  by  chemical  5043  5044  transformation.  Thus, epoxidation of 4'  - with m-CPBA at 10°C, in CH2Cl2,  afforded the 5a,lOe.-epoxide 2 as the main product by attack of the bulky  reagent from the less hindered u-face. Stereochemical assignment of the  epoxy ring of 5 can be made by comparative 13  -  C NMR analysis of 2 and 4.  -  Thus in 2&, c-8 appears at a more shielded position(32.7 ppn) than in 4  (37.7 ppm, Table 1). This can be explained by a shielding effect due to  the "y-gauche like" relaticnship between the C-~-H and the5u,lOcr-oxirane  ring in 2. Treatment of epoxide 5 with LDA and phenylselenyl bromide4  in dry THF at -78Oc followed by addition of hydrogen peroxide at  room  temp, furnished a product that upon acetylation was identical  in  all  aspects with natural 2.  Epoxivellozin [i: C20H28C4; m.p. 142-4%; [c]F = + 14.9 (c= 0.77 CHC13)  ]  revealed in the IR spectrum the presence of a conjugated ketone  (1630  -1  cm , broad band), hydroxyl (3420cm -1 , broad band), and vinyl (900 cm -3  groups. The UV spectrum presented bands at Xmax  EtoH 228 and 291 nm, which  EtOH  were shifted to Xmax 229 and 338 nm after addition of one drop a NaOH  solution, indicating the presence of a diosphenol chromophore.'  Table 2 lists the 1 H NMR spectral data of 3b assigned to the cor-  -  responding protons by integration, multiplicity and  nuclear  magnetic  double resonance techniques. The smaller value of the coupling constant  of one of th'a protons at C-14 (J= 2.5Hz) indicatesits equatorial position  (W-type coupling with Heq-12). The presence of two hydroxyl group  was  confirmed by acetylation of 3a (Ac20/DMAP) to yield a diacetyl derivative  -  3b showing two methyl singlets at 2.02 and 2.24 ppm (acetyl groups) and  -  a double doublet at 5.24 ppm which corresponds to a carbinolic  proton  deshielded _by acetylation (4.04 ppm in 3). The UV spectrum of 3b showed  -  -  XEtOH  max  at 252 nm. The hypsochromic shift observed in the conversion of  3a to 3b confirmed the presence of the diosphenol chromophore  in 3a.5  -  --  The re-naining oxygen atom in 3a was assigned to a tetrasubstituted  epoxide moiety on the basis of 13 -  c NMR peaks observed  at 66.9 (s) and  72.3 (s) ppm. Reduction of 3b with NaBH4 in MeOH at room temp gave mono  -  acetate (3~) (XzizH 228 and 291 nm). The l3 C NMR spectral data of 3a  -  -  and 3b (Table 2) in combination with biogenetic considerations  allowed  -  postulation of structure 3a for epoxivellozin.  -  The fact that compound 3a occurs in the sameplantwith velloziolide  -  1 allows US  to consider s as a possible biogenetic precursor  for the  former diterpenoid.  5045  Table 1  Carbon  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  70°  CH3  Table 2  Heq-1:  Hax-1:  2H-2  2H-3  Hax-11:  Heq-12:  Hax-12:  Heq-14:  Hax-14:  H-15:  H-16:  H-16:  CH3-17  CH3 -18  CH3-19  CH3-20  13 C n.m.r. spectral data(& 1 for compounds &,  &,  3&, 4  and 2, (TMS as internal standard,in  CDC13)  2b  -  145.4  128.4  201.0  48.2  64.3  23.0  3a  -  28.1  17.9  37.7  3b  -  28.2  17.7  31.8  72.3  189.7  30.0  140.2  128.9  23.9  45.3  66.9  70.9  44.0  38.0  33.3  143.6  112.9  36.7  29.9  31.9  70.4  186.9  23.4  138.7  143.8  45.4  68.5  72.5  39.0  37.5  33.3  142.5  113.9  4  -  25.1  37.1  216.0  47.6  133.1  24.9  27.4  37.7  42.9  136.4  72.9  43.6  37.3  40.5  146.6  112.1  31.1  25.8  23.0  11.6  5  -  22.4  33.7  213.0  48.9  66.9  22.4  23.1  31.8  42.0  23.5  32.7  39.9  68.4  74.7  40.2  38.0  37.0  146.5  113.5  31.1  17.3  24.3  11.2  169.7  21.6  26.2  17.3  26 .O  19.3  169.1 167.8  20.2  21.5  68.9  JO.8  43.4  37.4  40.1  145.9  112.3  30.9  18.7  22.4  8.9  1 H n.m.r. spectral data (6)  including decoupling  experiments  for vellozioepoxi  3b (430MHz,  TMS as internal  standard, in  -  CDC13)  2.60 (dt, J= 15 and 4Hz)  1.97  (ddd, J= 15,ll and 5Hz)  1.70-1.20  4.05 (dd,  J= 11 and 4.4Hz)  1.78 (ddd, J= 13, 4.4 and 2.5Hz)-_  1.68 (dd,  J= 13 and 11Hz)  3.02 (dd,  J=  1.92 (d,  J= 15Hz)-_  *  15 and 2.5Hz  5.60 (dd, J= 18.0 and L1.3Hz)  5.02 (d,  J= 18Hz)  4.98 (d,  J= 11.3IIz)  1.09 (s)  1.30 (s)  1.22 (S)  1.34 (s)  5046  2a=H  2b=Ac  5  3a=&&H  3b=&&Ac  3c&=H,  &Ac  We are grateful to Profa.
