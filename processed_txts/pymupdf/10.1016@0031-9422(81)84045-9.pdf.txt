Abstract--A re-examination of the trunk wood of Licaria armeniaca led to the isolation of 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin,  1,2,3-trimethoxy-7-oxoaporphine  (tri-O-methylmoschatoline),  2e-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-6e-(3,4-dimethoxy-  phenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo [3.3.0]octan (magnolin) and a novel neolignan (7S,8R, l'S,2'S, YS)-2'-acetoxy-l'-allyl-3',5'-  dimethoxy-8-methyl-7-piperonyl-bicyclo [3.2.1 ]-oct-5'- en-4'-one.  INTRODUCTION  A previous study of the trunk wood of the Amazonian  Lauraceae species Licaria armeniaca (Nees) Kosterm.  revealed the presence of 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin and of  two porosin-type neolignans [2]. The species is rather  widespread and seemingly prone to chemical variation.  Indeed, the study of another specimen indicated 6,7-  dimethoxycoumarin and the oxoaporphine tri-O-  methylmoschatoline [3] to be accompanied by the  furofuran lignan magnolin [4] and a novel neolignan. For  reasons stated in a previous paper of this series [5],  nomenclature and numbering of neolignans follow the  rules outlined in a recent review [6 ].  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The neolignan, C23H2sO ~ by C and H NMR counts  associated with a mass spectrometric molecular weight  determination,  was assigned  structure  la  upon  l  comparison with lb [6 ] and 2 [7 ] by IR, H NMR (Table  1), 13C NMR (Table 2) and ORD (Table 3) data. Indeed  the H-9 (6 0.92 _+ 0.02) and H-6' (6 5.65 + 0.05) signals of  la and lb are similar and differ significantly from the H-9  (6 1.23) and H-6' (6 6.10) signals of 2. As expected, the t3C  NMR signals for C-9 (6 13.9) and C-6' (6 124.1) of la  (endo-Me-8) occur at a higher field than the signals for C-9  (6 17.4) and C-6' (6 126.8) of 2 (exo-Me-8), in view of the  reciprocal y-effects felt by these carbons in the former  compound.  The significant spectral differences between la and lh  are due to the existence of piperonyl and acetoxyl in lavs  3-methoxypiperonyl and hydroxyl in lb. This was  confirmed respectively by MS, which cleaves la into the  typical [CH20 2 . C6H 3 . CH=CH.

Hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl to  the MeO-3' oxygen impels the MeO-methyl to such a  position as to exert y-effects on C-2' of le (+5 78.2 vs 84.5 for  C-2' in 3) and on C-7 of 3 (6 55.6 vs 57.0 for C-7 of lc). As  the natural compound la is recovered upon acetylation of  le, the configuration of its aeetoxy is confirmed.  An independent confirmation of the spatial vicinity vs  distance  of hydroxyl  and  aryl  was  achieved by  measurement of the CsDsN-induced solvent shifts for the  Table 2. ~ 3C NMR chemical shifts (6 values from TMS) of neolignan (in  CDC13) signals  la  le  3  2  Position  (20 MHz)  (25.2 MHz)  (25.2 MHz)  (20 MHz)  C-1  131.0  131.4  132.2  133.3  C-2  107.7  107.6  107.9  108.2  C-3  147.5  147.4  147.5  148.0  C-4  146.5  146.3  146.4  147.8  C-5  110.6  110.8  109.6  108.7  C-6  119.5  120.3  119.4  121.4  C-7  57.5  57.0  55.6  53.1  C-8  49.4  48.6  46.3  47.4  C-9  13.9  13.9  13.4  17.4  C-1'  50.8  51.4  48.1  51.8  C-2'  77.6  78.2  84.5  80.9  C-3'  90.2  90.8  90.2  64.9  C-4'  193.6  194.6  195.8  185.8  C-5'  152.1  151.4  151.2  153.0  C-6'  124.1  123.8  123.0  126.8  C-7'  37.1  36.6  38.1  34.6  C-8'  133.9  134.4  132.4  134.3  C-9'  118.6  117.9  117.9  118.2  OMe-3'  54.8  54.5  53.5  OMe-5'  55.5  55.4  55.4  55.3  O2CH 2  100.9  100.8  100.8  100.9  OAc  21.0  169.1  Lignans and neolignans from Licaria armeniaca  1965  epimeric alcohols.

The powdered wood (5kg) was  percolated successively with C6H 6 and EtOH. The solvents were  evapd and the residues submitted to chromatographic  fractionation employing solvent (C6He, CHCI3, EtOAc, MeOH)  mixtures of gradually increasing polarity. The C6H e extract (16 g  on 480g Si gel) gave, in order, sitosterol (lg), 6,7-  dimethoxycoumarin (30rag), la (130rag) and a mixture.  Purification of the mixture by prep. TLC (Si gel, CeHe-Me2CO ,  4:1) gave tri-O-methylmoschatoline (16mg). The EtOH extract  (10g on 350g Si gel) gave, in order, sitosterol (0.3g), tri-O-  mcthylmoschatoline (82g)and magnolin (14mg).  Identifications. Sitosterol, 6,7-dimethoxyeoumarin [2] and tri-  O-methylmoschatoline [3 ] were identified by direct comparison  with authentic samples. Magnolin was identified by comparison  of 1H NMR and MS with the analogous data reported in the lit.  [4].  (7S, 8R, I'S, 2'S, 3'R)-Aa'-!',2',3',4'-Tetrahydro-4'-oxo -  7.3'.8.1'-neolignan (la).
