Abstract-Three  new ent-kaurene diterpenes have been isolated  from the roots and stem of Vellozia caput-ardeae.  Their structures  were elucidated  by spectroscopic  methods  as ent-9/3-hydroxy  kaur-16-ene,  ent-1 lu-hydroxy  kaur-16-  ene and ent-9/?,lla-dihydroxy  kaur-16-ene.  INTRODUCTION  In previous  papers [l, 21 we described  two  kaurene  diterpenes  and one seco-kaurene  from  Vellozia caput-  ardeae. In the present  communication  we report  the  isolation  and structural  determination  of three hydroxy-  lated kaurenes  from the same species.  RESULTS ANDDISCUSSION  The molecular formulae of the isomeric alcohols  la and  2a (C,,H,,O)  and the diol 3a (C20H3202)  were de-  termined  by high-resolution  mass  spectrometry.  The  ‘H NMR  spectra  of each of the three compounds  con-  tained resonances  assigned to three tertiary methyl groups  and an exocyclic  methylene  which suggested  that they  were tetracyclic diterpenes,  probably  of the kaurene class.  la R=H, uOH  lb R=H, aOAc  1~ R=O  2a  i  ’ fl  k\  ‘.  2b  3a R=H, OOH  3b R =H, aOAc  3C R=O  The oxygen-containing  functional  group  of la was  shown  to  be  a secondary  hydroxyl  group  by  IR  (vki;crn-‘:  3450 and 1060) and by the presence of a triple  doublet at 6 4.28 (lH, J = 10,8 and 8 Hz)in the ‘H NMR  spectrum. This signal was shifted downfield to 6 5.37 upon  acetylation  of la to lb. The multiplicity  of this signal (ddd)  indicated  the vicinity of methine  and methylene  units.  This limited the possible positions  for the hydroxyl group  to C-6 or C-11. The C-6 position  was eliminated  by  analysis  of the  13C NMR  spectra  (Table  1). In the  spectrum  for kaurene, the triplets for C-2, C-6 and C-l 1  are found near 6 20 while the triplets for C-7 and C-12  appear  near  6 40 and  30, respectively[3].  As  the  “C NMR spectrum of la exhibited only two triplets near  6 20 and absence of a triplet near 30, it was clear that C-l 1  was oxygenated.  This was further  corroborated  by the  spectroscopic  properties  of the ketone lc derived from la.  The 13C NMR  signals  for C-9 and C-12 showed  the  expected downfield  shifts (Table 1) for lc compared  to la.  Compound  la  was,  thus,  identified  as  ent-lla-  hydroxykaur-16-ene.  Compound  2a was found to be a tertiary alcohol: IR  v,a,cm-l:  3500; 13C NMR  singlet  at 677.6, and the  absence in the ‘H NMR spectrum  of signals which could  be assigned  to a carbinolic  proton.  Further evidence for the location of the hydroxyl group  at C-9 was the dehydration  product  2b of 2a, whose  ‘H NMR  spectrum  exhibited  a triplet at 6 5.14 (lH, J  = 4 Hz) [4]. Comparison  of the 13C NMR spectra of 2a  and kaurene [3] confirmed the above deductions. The C-9  hydroxyl  group in 2a caused  an up-field  shift in the  resonances  assigned  to C-l, C-5, C-7 and C-15 through  the strong  y-effects within the cyclic system[5,6].  The  chemical  shift of C-20, as expected,  was unaltered  in  comparison  to the model  compound.  This data  also  confirmed  the stereochemistry  assigned to 2a. Compound  2a was, therefore,  identified  as ent-9,G’-hydroxy-kaur-16-  ene.  The ‘H NMR spectrum  of compound  3a showed two  signals at 6 1.62 and 2.10 (both exchangeable  with D20).  This data determined  that 3a was a diol. One of the  hydroxyl  groups  was secondary,  as shown  by a double  doublet  at 6 3.96 (lH, J = 10 and 8 Hz) which moved  downfield  to 4.94 upon acetylation  of 3a to 3b. The  2017  2018  A. C.

The  position  of the  tertiary  hydroxyl  group  was  determined  to be at C-9, from the 13C NMR chemical  shifts of C-l, C-5, C-7 and C-15 in comparison  with the  spectrum  of 2a.  The multiplicity  of the signal assigned to the carbinolic  proton,  a double  doublet,  limited  the location  of the  secondary  hydroxyl group to C-l, C-7 or C-l 1. Positions  C-l and C-7 were eliminated  by analysis of the “C NMR  spectra  of compounds  3a-3c.  As regards  the stereochemistry  of two substances,  la  and 3a, the magnitude  of the coupling  constants  for the  carbinolic  proton  at C-11 in these substances  and their  derivatives  (lb and 3b) made it obvious that this hydroxyl  group was equatorial.  Compound  3a was. thus, shown to  be ent-9p,l la-dihydroxy-kaur-16-ene.  EXPERIMENTAL  Mps are uncorr.
