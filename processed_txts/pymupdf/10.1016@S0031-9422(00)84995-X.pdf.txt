INTRODUCTION  Ocotea aaphylla, a lauraceous  tree popularly  known  as  canelaamarela,  ranges  in central  Brazil  from  Minas  Gerais and Espirito  Santa to Santa Catarina.  Its heart-  wood resists termites and is used for flooring  [2].

The three bicyclo[3.2.l]octanoids  1 (canellin-  A), 2a and 2b (S-methoxyguianin)  have been isolated from  &aria  canella 133, Ocotea catharinensrs [4] and kziba  afinrs [S], respectively,  and were identified  by direct  comparison  with authentic  samples. The neolignan  3a was  identified with ferrearin-B  previously  isolated from Aniba  ferrea [6]. Compound  3b proved  to be novel and was  designated  ferrearin-C.

The  close correspondence  of the ‘H and ‘%NMR  signals  assigned to the cyclohexenone  part of the structures  indicates that the difference resides in the configuration of  C-2 or C-3. Indeed, the compounds differ only in the 2,3-  CIS (3a) and 2,3-rrans (3b) arrangement of the aryl/methyl  substituents, as shown by the ‘HNMR  Me-doublets (J  = 8 Hz) at 60.77 versus 0.96, respectively. The sole other  conspicuous difference in these spectra refers to the H-2  doublets (J = 10 Hz) at 65.40 versus 4.67, respectively.  This indicates the association of H-2 with the oxygen  atom of HO-7a only m 3a which thus must sustain both  substituents m the syn-configuration;  in contradistinction  to 3b where H-2 and HO-7a occupy opposite sides of the  molecule. As 1s consequently to be expected, the ’ 3C NMR  spectrum reveals hydroxyl-7a to contribute y-effects on C-  2 (681.7) and C-3 (644.3) of 3a, but not on C-2 (688.7) of  3b. However, the configurations  of C-3 in both com-  pounds are identical and it is less easy to rationalize the  fact that as C-2, C-3 (6 50.3) of 3b also does not feel the y-  effect due to hydroxyl-7a. The H-2, H-3 coupling const-  ants for both compounds are rather large (ca 10 Hz) and  the H-2-H-3 dihedral angle thus must be close to 0” in 3a  and close to 180” in 3b. Models of the compounds,  constructed considering also this conformational  infor-  mation, indicate the possible existence of a hydrogen  bridge between the oxygen at C-7a and the aryl at C-2.  This preferential orientation of the hydroxyl towards the  aryl in 3b impedes the transmission of the y-effect from its  oxygen to C-3.  The allylic methylene carbons of 3a and 3b are shielded  (640.1, 39.6, respectively) in comparison with the analog-  ous group of the model compound 4 (643.9) [7] and thus  occur most probably  in a syn-relationship  with the  methyls at C-3. Indeed these substituents  appear to be  shielded reciprocally if 3a and 3b (6 10.6,9.4, respectively)  are again compared with the model compound 4 (6 12.0)  m  The relative stereochemistries  which thus result for  ferrearin-B (3a) and C (3b) differ from those originally  proposed  for ferrearin-A  (Sa) and B (5b) [6]. The  structures of the two latter compounds  thus must be  revised respectively to 3c and 3a.

The ferrearms are devoid of oxygenation at one of the  two ring-carbons  pura related to a C-3 substituent. As for  other neolignan types which share this biosynthetically  interesting feature [6] their genesis from propenyl- and  allylphenol derived radicals (7 and 8, respectively) might  thus involve an allylic rearrangement  (9 -B 10; Scheme 1).

THOMSON*  Department  of Chemistry, NagarJuna University, Nagarjunanagar  522510, India; *Department  of Chemistry, University of  Aberdeen, Meston Walk, Old Aberdeen AB9 ZUE, Scotland  (Received 2 March 1984)  Key Word Index--Yentilugo  calyculata; Rhamnaceae; anthraqumones.  Abstract-Two  new anthraquinones  have been isolated from the root bark of Ventilugo calyculata and their structures  shown to be 2,4,8-trihydroxy-1-methoxy-3-methylanthraquinone  and  2,4,8-trihydroxy-1,6dimethoxy-3-methyl-  anthraquinone.  INTRODUCTION  The genus Venttlugo 1s a rich source of anthraqumones  [l-4]. Further investigation of the root bark of Ventilngo  calyculata afforded two more new anthraquinones,  2 and  4, in addition  to the eleven anthraquinones  reported  previously [2].  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Pigment  2, C16H1206, gives a positive reduction test  with Na2S204, indicating its anthraquinone  nature, and  forms a trimethyl ether. It is soluble in aqueous sodium  carbonate suggesting the presence of a fl-hydroxyl group,  and as there is only one IR carbonyl band, at 1630 cm- ‘,  the remaining two hydroxyl groups are in a-positions, and  from the visible spectrum (A_ 443 nm) it must be a 1,5 or  1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone.  The ‘H NMR  spectrum  confirms the presence of a fi-hydroxyl and two peri-  hydroxyl groups, and shows signals for a methoxyl and a  b-methyl group. In addition an ABC pattern for three  aromatic protons at 67.26 (d, J = 8 Hz), 7.63 (t, J = 8 Hz)  and 7.79 (d, .I = 8 Hz) indicated that one ring carries only  a peri-substituent.  Hydrolysis of the methoxyl group with  80 % H2S04 indicates that it is located at a peri position,  and as the product was 2-hydroxylslandicin  1 the new  pigment must be either 2 or 3. The latter was excluded on  the basis of a negative zirconium nitrate test, and the  absence of a shift in the visible spectrum on addltlon of  NaOAc-H,BOJ  (for alizarin the shift 1s 22 nm) thus  demonstrating  the absence of a vicinal dihydroxy system.  Hence the pigment has structure 2. The trimethyl ether of  2 was identical with the tetramethyl ether of 2-hydroxy-  islandicin (1).  The second new pigment  4, C,7H1407r shows all the  features of 2 except that the ‘HNMR  spectrum reveals  the presence of a second methoxyl group and the ABC  system 1s replaced by two meta protons.
