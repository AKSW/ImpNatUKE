Several species of Cassia are widely used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial, laxative, antiulcerogenic, analgesic and anti-inﬂammatory properties, which could be correlated with the accumulation of phenolic compounds in their bioactive extracts.1—5) In previous investigations, we re- ported the isolation, the structural elucidation and the bioac- tivity proﬁle of (�)-spectaline and other related piperidine alkaloids from Cassia spectabilis (sin. Senna spectabilis).6,7) More recently we have identiﬁed (�)-spectaline (LASSBio- 754, Chart 1) as a potent antinociceptive agent in the April 2008 407 Antinociceptive Proﬁle of 2,3,6-Trisubstituted Piperidine Alkaloids:  3-O-Acetyl-spectaline and Semi-synthetic Derivatives of (�)-Spectaline Cláudio VIEGAS, Jr.,a Magna Suzana ALEXANDRE-MOREIRA,b Carlos Alberto Manssour FRAGA,c Eliezer Jesus BARREIRO,c Vanderlan da Silva BOLZANI,d and Ana Luísa Palhares de MIRANDA*,c a Laboratório de Fitoquímica e Química Medicinal, Departamento de Ciências Exatas, Universidade Federal de Alfenas; 37130–000, Alfenas, MG, Brazil: b Laboratório de Farmacologia e Imunidade, Departamento de Fisiologia, Centro de Ciências Biológicas, Universidade Federal de Alagoas; Maceió, Al, Brazil: c Laboratório de Avaliação e Síntese de Substâncias Bioativas, Departamento de Fármacos, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; 21941–902, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil: and d Núcleo de Bioensaios, Biossíntese e Ecoﬁsiologia de Produtos Naturais, Instituto de Química, Universidade Estadual Paulista; 14800–900, Araraquara, SP, Brazil. Received July 2, 2007; accepted January 24, 2008; published online January 28, 2008 In early studies, we have reported the antinociceptive proﬁle of (�)-spectaline, a piperidine alkaloid from Cassia spectabilis. The present study describes the synthesis, the antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory activities of a series of 2,3,6-trialkyl-piperidine alkaloids: the natural (�)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) and ten semi-synthetic spectaline derivatives. Structure–activity relationship (SARs) studies were performed. The struc- tures of all synthesized derivatives were conﬁrmed by means of nuclear magnetic resonance. Compounds were evaluated for their analgesic (acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constrictions, hot-plate test, formalin-in- duced pain test) and some of them for the anti-inﬂammatory activities (carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test). The pharmacological results showed that several of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 mmol/kg signiﬁcantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than (�)-spectaline. LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. In the formalin-induced pain only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the in- ﬂammatory phase, (�)-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity. In the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, only (�)-spectaline exhibited an anti-inﬂammatory proﬁle, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 mmol/kg. Our results suggest different mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio-776 (3-O-Boc- spectaline), LASSBio-755 (3-O-acetyl-spectaline) and (�)-spectaline (LASSBio-754). The antinociceptive proﬁle of some of the semi-synthetic spectaline derivatives extends our research concerning the chemical and pharmaco- logical optimization of isolated natural products in the search of new drug candidates from brazilian biodiver- sity.

Design Concept of the New 2,3,6-Trisubstituted Piperidine Derivatives writhing test (ED50�48.5 mmol/kg) and capsaicin induced pain (ED50�20.8 mmol/kg).8) Extending our research program concerning the bio- prospection of natural products and its derivatives, we have selected, to conclude this investigation, another abundant piperidine alkaloid, (�)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio- 755, Chart 1) and synthesized other 10 semi-synthetic deriva- tives prepared from natural (�)-spectaline, i.e. a series of 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine alkaloids. The present study was focused on the synthesis, evaluation of antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory properties and structure–activity rela- tionship (SAR) analysis of these new derivatives in order to verify the stereoelectronic contributions and requirements of the pharmacophoric groups A, B and C for the antinocicep- tive and anti-inﬂammatory activities (Chart 1). Results and Discussion The antinociceptive proﬁle of all new 2,3,6-trisubstituted piperidine derivatives developed herein was initially evalu- ated using classical acetic acid-induced mouse abdominal constriction test,9) with indomethacin as standard. The results are disclosed in Fig. 1. Some of the new compounds given orally at a dose of 100 mmol/kg signiﬁcantly inhibited the acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions, but they were less active than (�)-spectaline and indomethacin. Among them, the natural acetate derivative (LASSBio-755) and its O-Boc analogue (LASSBio-776) were the most actives with 37% and 31.7% of inhibition. Based on these results some preliminary structure–activity relationships were analysed. Comparing the inhibitory proﬁle of compounds LASSBio- 782, LASSBio-821 and LASSBio-775 with LASSBio-776 and LASSBio-755 indicates that the presence of groups that blocked the hydrogen bond donnor character of the piperi- dine nitrogen seems to be deletery for the analgesic activity. On the other hand, the antinociceptive activity showed to be inversely dependent of the volume of the groups at C-3 (OR1 group) once that the inhibition of the constrictions follows the order R1�H�Ac�Boc. The introduction of more polar and hydrogen bond-donating hydroxy groups at C-13� in the alcohol or oxime derivatives, i.e. LASSBio-781, LASSBio- 820 and LASSBio-784, did not result in a increase of the an- tinociceptive activity but indicated through the direct com- parison of the bioproﬁle of compounds LASSBio-781 and LASSBio-820 that the stereochemistry at C-3 seems to be a pharmacophoric requirement for an adequate ﬁt in the target receptor. Additionally, the introduction of an acetyl group at C-3 of LASSBio-755 modify drastically the toxicological as- pect of these alkaloids, once that it did not show any sign of toxicity when administered at a single dose of 500 mmol/kg (data not shown) in contrast with (�)-spectaline (LASSBio- 754).8) Considering the signiﬁcant antinociceptive activity ob- served for LASSBio-755 and its analogue LASSBio-776 we decided to investigate its effects on other models of pain and compare the results with that showed by (�)-spectaline (LASSBio-754).8) In the formalin-induced pain10) only LASSBio-776 was able to inhibit by 34.4% the paw licking response of the inﬂammatory phase, (�)-spectaline and LASSBio-755 did show any activity (Fig. 2). Indomethacin and other nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the later phase without interfering on the earlier one in the formalin-induced pain test.11) These results on the for- malin test led us to investigate the anti-inﬂammatory proﬁle of these same compounds on the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema.9) LASSBio-755 and, unexpectedly, LASSBio- 776 did not show an anti-inﬂammatory activity at the dose used. Only (�)-spectaline was able to inhibit the edema for- mation, showing an ED50 value of 56.6 mmol/kg (Fig. 3). The same order of potency was observed for both antinociceptive (ED50�48.5 mmol/kg)8) and anti-inﬂammatory (ED50�56.6 mmol/kg) (Fig. 3) activities of (�)-spectaline (LASSBio- 754), indicating a common pathway of action. Despite the absence of effect on the neurogenic phase of the formalin test at the dose used, LASSBio-755 and LASS- Bio-776 showed a signiﬁcant increase in the latency time in the hot-plate test,12) similar to morphine, while (�)-spec- taline (LASSBio-754), even at a dose of 300 mmol/kg, was inactive (Fig. 4). The hot-plate and formalin test differs in some aspects. Hot-plate test is based on the use of a short-duration nocicep- tive thermal stimulus (phasic pain) while formalin use a long-duration chemical stimulus (tonic pain). Tissue injury leads to a persistent afferent input in the latter. The nocicep- tive response in the ﬁrst phase of formalin and hot-plate models seems to result from direct activation of nociceptors and is inhibited by drugs which act mainly at central sites.13,14) Centrally acting analgesics are also effective in the second phase.10) This phase is attributed mainly to the devel- opment of an inﬂammatory reaction at the site of injection and increased synaptic transmission in the spinal cord.13) 408 Vol. 56, No. 4 Fig. 1.

Considering the central activity observed for LASSBio-755 and LASSBio-776 in the hot-plate test, it was expected to observe some activity in the earlier phase of the formalin that could be dependent of the magnitude of the dose. The ﬁrst phase of formalin is brief and occurs in the ﬁrst 5 min. The ﬁrst measure in the hot-plate test was at 30 min and only LASSBio-755 showed a signiﬁcant activity. LASSBio-776 showed a signiﬁcant activity from 60 min. Since the com- pounds were administered orally and the dose used was the same in both tests, the lack of activity on the neurogenic phase could be related with the pharmacokinetics proﬁle of the compounds and somewhat with the mechanisms of the pain processing in these different models. Recently, searching for new candidates compounds useful for treating Alzheimer’s disease, the chloride analogues of some of these semi-synthetic piperidine alkaloid derivatives were described as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.15) The cholinergic system was involved in the transmission of noci- ceptive information and cholinergic drugs, such as mus- carinic and nicotinic agonists, and also acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were described to induce antinociception.16—18) The acetylcholine-induced constriction test has been used for screening analgesic compounds.19) In this model (�)-spec- taline and LASSBio-776 similarly inhibited the constrictions by 44.7% and 47.9%, respectively, while LASSBio-755 showed a more important antinociceptive effect, inhibiting the constrictions by 82% (Fig. 5). These results in addition with the hot-plate test and the acetylcholinesterase in- hibition15) suggest the involvement of the cholinergic system in the antinociceptive response elicited by LASSBio-776 and LASSBio-755. Taken together these results suggest differents mechanisms of action for the analgesic activity observed for LASSBio- 776 (3-O-Boc-spectaline) and LASSBio-755 (3-O-acetyl- spectaline), acting mainly by modulation of receptors located at central nervous system, and for (�)-spectaline (LASSBio- 754) that showed to be a peripheral analgesic and anti-in- ﬂammatory agent. In conclusion, this study revealed new analgesic com- pounds derived from (�)-spectaline without apparent toxic- ity and gave support to the strategy of modiﬁcations of iso- lated natural products from brazilian biodiversity seeking the optimization of the biological activities in the search of new drug candidates. Experimental Chemistry The natural alkaloids (�)-spectaline (LASSBio-754) and (�)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (LASSBio-755) were obtained from the ethanolic extract of ﬂowers of Cassia spectabilis (DC.) IRWIN et BARN (Leguminosae), as previously described. 6,7) For the preparation of the target derivatives from (�)-spectaline (LASS- Bio-754) the reaction sequences outlined in Chart 2 were followed. Reaction of LASSBio-754 with HCl under anhydrous conditions in CH2Cl2 yielded the hidrochloride LASSBio-768. Carbamate LASSBio-775 and carbonate LASSBio-776 were prepared, as a 1 : 2 mixture, by reaction of LASSBio- 754 with (BOC)2O/Et3N in CH2Cl2.20—22) Silyl ether LASSBio-777 was  obtained by reaction of LASSBio-754 with tert-butyl dimethyl silyl triﬂate (TBSOTf)/2,6-lutidine in CH2Cl2.23,24) Treatment of carbonate LASSBio- 776 with BzCl/4-DMAP/Et3N25,26) and MsCl/Et3N in CH2Cl2 afforded N- benzoyl carbonate LASSBio-782 and N-methanesulfonyl carbonate LASS- Bio-821, respectively. Oxidation of LASSBio-754 under Jones conditions yielded the diketone LASSBio-766, that was subsequently reduced with LiAlH4 in THF to afford LASSBio-820. Reduction of LASSBio-754 with NaBH4 in MeOH furnished LASSBio-781, that differs from LASSBio-820 at the absolute conﬁguration on C-3. Finally, LASSBio-754 was converted into the oxime LASSBio-784 by reaction with NH2OH·HCl in pyridine/ EtOH.27,28) Melting points were determined with a Microquimica MQAPF-301 melt- ing point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were April 2008 409 Fig. 3.

Pharmacology Experiments were carried out in albino swiss mice (20—25 g) and rats (150—200 g) of both sexes from LASSBio (Faculty of Pharmacy, UFRJ, Brazil) breeding unit. All animals were kept in standard- ized conditions, maintained only with water ad libitum for 12 h before the experiment. Animal experiments were performed according to the “Princi- ples of Laboratory Animal Care and Use in Research” (Colégio Brasileiro de Experimentação Animal-COBEA/Instituto Brasileiro Carlos Chagas Filho-IBCCFO, Brazil), based on international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and ethical guidelines for investigation of experi- mental pain in conscious animals.29) All compounds were administered orally (0.1 ml/20 g) as a suspension in arabic gum (0.5% in saline) (vehicle) 1 h before the noxius stimulus. In- domethacin was used as standard. Results are expressed as mean�S.E.M. of “n” animals per group and the activities expressed as percentage of inhibi- tion when compared with the vehicle control group. The data were statisti- cally analyzed by the Student’s t test for a signiﬁcance level of ∗ p�0.05. When appropriated, the ED50 values (i.e. the dose able to elicit 50% of the maximum effect observed) were determined by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software. Acetic Acid-Induced Abdominal Constriction in Mice The antinoci- ceptive activity was determined in vivo using the mouse abdominal constric- tion test induced by acetic acid 0.6% (0.1 ml/10 g; i.p.).9) Compounds and in- domethacin were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. Ten minutes after i.p. injection of the acetic acid the number of constrictions per animal was recorded for 20 min. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle. Acetylcholine-Induced Abdominal Constriction in Mice Constric- tions were induced by acetylcholine (4.0 mg/kg; i.p.) and the number of con- strictions per animal was recorded for 10 min.30) (�)-Spectaline, LASSBio- 755 and LASSBio-776 were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. Control animals received an equal volume of vehicle. Formalin-Induced Pain in Mice The formalin-induced pain test was carried out as described by Hunskaar and Hole.10) Animals were injected subplantarly with 20 ml of 2.5% formalin in hind paw. (�)-Spectaline, LASSBio-755, LASSBio-776, indomethacin were administered at a dose of 100 mmol/kg. The time that mice spent licking or biting the injected paw or leg was recorded. Two distinct periods of intensive licking activity were identiﬁed and scored separately unless otherwise stated. The ﬁrst period (earlier or neurogenic phase) was recorded 0—5 min after formalin injection and the second period (later or inﬂammatory phase) was recorded 15— 30 min after injection. Anti-inﬂammatory Activity The anti-inﬂammatory activity was deter- mined in vivo using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test as previ- ously described.9) (�)-Spectaline and indomethacin were administered at a range dose of 10—300 mmol/kg and 0.3—100 mmol/kg respectively, LASS- Bio-755 and LASSBio-776 at 100 mmol/kg. Animals were then injected subplantarly with either 0.1 ml of 1% carrageenan solution in saline (0.1 mg/paw) or sterile saline (NaCl 0.9%) into one of the hind paw, respec- tively. The paw volumes were measured using a glass plethysmometer cou- pled to a peristaltic pump, 3 h after the subplantar injection. The edema was calculated as the volume difference between the carrageenan and saline- treated paw. Hot-Plate Test Central analgesic activity was investigated using the hot plate test as described earlier.12) In these experiments, the hot plate apparatus (Ugo Basile, Model-DS 37) was maintained at 56�1 °C. Mice were placed on the heated surface and the time between placement and the ﬁrst sign of paw licking or jumping was recorded as latency. Latency was recorded at  0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after oral administration of vehicle, morphine (39.5 mmol/kg, used as positive control) or compounds (100 mmol/kg). The basal latencies were found to be 6—10 s. A cut-off time of 30 s was followed to prevent any injury to the paws.
