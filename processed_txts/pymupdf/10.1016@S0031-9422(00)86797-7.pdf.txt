258  N. C. FRANCA, 0. R. GOITLIEB and D. T. COXON  GC-MS and shown to be a mixture of dimethyl axelate  (Sa N 40 yd and dimethyl sebacate (Sh, = 60 %). At this  stage two possible constitutions,  la or 6, could be con-  sidered for rubrenolide. The 1,2-dial system or the vinyl  group could occupy either terminal of the C,,-chain,  but the C1 branch must correspond to the carboxy group  of the y-lactone. Both of these structures could give rise  to axelaic and sebacic acid on vigorous oxidation. On  mild oxidation  with chromic oxide in aqueous acetic  acid at room temperature, however, rubrenolide gave a  vinylic acid, C,,H,,O*  (2c, v,, 1645,990,910,1760  and  1695 cm-‘). The NMR spectrum of this acid showed  two signals at r 7.05 (lH, dd, J 17.5 and 3.5 Hz) and 7.49  (lH, dd, J 17.5 and 8.5 Hz), absent from the analogous  Rl+yAR3  (la) RI = R2 = H, R3 = CH=CH,  (lb) R’ = RZ = H, R3 = CECH  (lc) R’ = RZ = H, R3 = CH,Me  (Id) R’ = R* = AC, R3 = CH=CH,  (le) R1 = R2 = AC, R3 = CSCH  (lf) R’ = RZ = Ac, R3 = CH,Me  (Ig) R’ = R2 = SiMe,, R3 = CH=CH,  (lb) R’ = RZ = SiMe,, R3 = CSCH  (li) R’-R2 = CMe,, R3 = CH=CH,  (I]) R’-R2 = CMe,, R” = CECH  (lk) R’-R2 = CMe,, R3 = CH,Me  (11) R’ = R2 = Me, R3 = CH=CH,  (1m)R’ = Me, RZ = H, R3 = CH=CH,  (4a) R = CH=CH,  (4b) R = CH,Me  (6)  spectrum of rubrenolide.  These signals were assigned  to a methylene group (geminal coupling constant  17.5  Hz) flanked on one side by an oxidatively generated  carboxyl group and on the other by a methine. The  formation of this product required the constitution  of  rubrenolide to be represented by the formula la.  Structure of rubrenolide  and rubrynolide  The constitutions  of rubrenolide  (la), rubrynolide (lb)  and dihydrorubrenolide  (lc) are compatible  with the  detailed interpretation  of their IR and NMR spectra, as  well as the high resolution examination  of their MS frag-  mentation  patterns (Scheme 1).

Constitution of principal MS fragment ions of rubrenolide (la, R = VH=CH,),  rubrynolide (lb, R = CSX-I)  and dihydrorubrenolide  (lc, R = CH,CH,)  Rubrenolide and rubrynolide  259  61. Other fragment ions have masses whose differences  are due to dizferential constitution  of the R-substituents  of la, lb and le. The NMR spectrum ~~hydro~br~~  lide (1~) is more informative than that of rubrenolide (la)  or rub~noli~  (lb) due to the absence of signals from  either allylic or propargylic methylene protons. In the  220 MHz spectrum of dihydrorubrenolide  (lc), seven  distinct  one proton  multiple@ are observed between  T 5-8, in addition to a broad methylene signal with a peak  at T 8.70 and a terminal methyl triplet (.7 6.5 Hz) at r 9.14.  Double resonance  experiments  at 100 MHz revealed  that the methine H-4 (T 5.54) was spin coupled (.I 5.5 Hz)  with H-3a (z 7.45) and the methme of the secondary  alcohol (r 6.28) was spin coupled (J 10 Hz) with one of  the protons of the methylene at C-2 (r 8.02), in agreement  with the assignments  given. Two one proton signals,  those due to H-3/? and the other proton at C-2, were  obscured by the broad methylene band which extended  down to T 8.2. The position and exact nature of the reson-  ance due to H-38 was of particular interest with regard  to the configuration  and conformation  of the lactone  ring. This seemed an ideal problem for solution by the  LIS method with a suitable derivative. Indeed, addition  of Eu(dpm),  [7j to the monoalcohol  2h, prepared by  borohydride reduction of 2a, gave NMR spectra in which  the chemical shift of H-3/I was assignable  by extra-  polation  to 0%  complexing  agent. The signal was  expected to appear as a double double doublet, since H-3fi  is coupled to H-3= (J,  125 Hz), H-2 and H-4, but the  signal observed was an apparent quartet of approximate  intensity ratio 1:3 :3 : 1 and of width 36 Hz This suggested  that the vicinal coupling constants Jz, 38 and Jsa,4 were  of the same order (11-12 Hz) as the geminal coupling  constant.  Further  derivatives  which proved useful for NMR  study were the methyl esters 2d and 2e derived from the  acid 2c. The 220 MHz NMR spectrum of the ester 2e  clearly showed signals due to H-3a and H-3/? at z 7.42  and 8.40, respectively. H-3a appeared as a ddd (J 12.5,  8.5 and 5.5 Hz) partly obscured by the double doublet  (J 17.5 and 8.5 Hz) due to one of the protons of C-2 at  T 7.51; and H-38 appeared as an approximately  sym-  metrical 1:3:3: 1 quartet of width 35 Hz,. ‘Spin tickling’  at z 5.61, corresponding  to H-4, caused the collapse of  both of these multiplets, whereas all other signals in the  spectrum remained apparently unchanged.  The complete assignment of all proton resonances and  coupling constants associated with the y-k&one showed  rubrenolide to possess the 2,4-trans conflguration. Com-  parison with analogous data given by some model cis (7)  and trans (8) 2,4disubstituted  y-butyrolactones  (Table  l), specially synthesized for this purpose [S], yielded  unequivocal proof of this fact.  Rubrenolide  and its derivatives  were all optically  active. ORD curves were determined on rubrenolide (la),  rubrynolide  (lb) and the two tetra-ols 3s and 3b obtained  by respective aluminium  hydride reduction. The curves  for rubrenolide  and rubrynolide  were very similar,  showing a positive Cotton effect and a peak maximum  (b, + 1700) at 226 nm The two tetra-01s gave plain posi-  tive curves of very low amplitude.  Application  of the  modified Hudson Lactone Rule [9] therefore enabled the  assignment of the R-configuration to the chiral centre at  C-4. C-2 must, consequently, possess the S-conSguration.  This allows both substituents of the la&one ring to be in  quasi-equatorial position (9).  A priori it could be imagined that hydrolysis of the  lactone moiety in rubrenolide  and relactonization  with  the alternative  y-hydroxyl of the ~,3’d~y~ox~ropyl  group should be a facile reaction. In spite of several trials,  such a reaction was not observed, rubrenolide  being  recovered as the sole lactonic product in all experiments.  This may indicate that C-2’ of the 2’,3’-dihydroxypropyl  group does not exist in the R-configuration  which would  allow both substituents of the hypothetical lactone again  to occupy q~~i-equators  co~g~ation~  In order to  understand  lack of formation, this alternative  lactone  must be less stable, and it can be implied that C-2’ exists  in the S-contiguration.  Indeed,  as expected,  when  Horeau’s method [lOI was applied to rubrenolide,  or  more precisely to its monomethyl  ether lm in order to  avoid esterification of the primary hydroxyf, d-a-phenyl-  butyric acid was obtained in 31.3 % optical yield.
