In the present work, the cytotoxicity of pristimerin was eval- uated in human tumor cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This work also examined the eﬀects of pri- stimerin (0.4; 0.8 and 1.7 lM) in HL-60 cells, after 6, 12 and 24 h of exposure. Pristimerin reduced the number of viable cells and increased number of non-viable cells in a concentration-dependent manner by tripan blue test showing morphological changes consistent with apoptosis. Nevertheless, pristimerin was not selective to cancer cells, since it inhibited PBMC proliferation with an IC50 of 0.88 lM. DNA synthesis inhibition assessed by 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in HL-60 cells was 70% and 83% for the concen- trations of 0.4 and 0.8 lM, respectively. Pristimerin (10 and 20 lM) was not able to inhibit topoisomerase I. In AO/EB (acridine orange/ ethidium bromide) staining, all tested concentrations reduced the number of HL-60 viable cells, with the occurrence of necrosis and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, results in agreement with trypan blue exclusion ﬁndings. The analysis of membrane integrity and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by ﬂow cytometry in the presence of pristimerin indicated that treated cells under- went apoptosis. The present data point to the importance of pristimerin as representative of an emerging class of potential anticancer chemicals, exhibiting an antiproliferative eﬀect by inhibiting DNA synthesis and triggering apoptosis. � 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite many therapeutic advances, mortality is still unacceptably high (Reddy et al., 2003). Most of the drugs used today in the clinic were ﬁrst discovered from plants and microorganisms (Mann, 2002). Thus, natural products continue to perform an essential role in the search for new anti-cancer molecules. Chemical studies carried out on Celastraceae species have revealed the occurrence of phenolic metabolites, such as condensed tannins (Gonzalez et al., 1982), ﬂavonoids (Corsino et al., 2003) and quinonemethide triterpenes (Cor- sino et al., 2000; Buﬀa Filho et al., 2002a,b; Carvalho et al., 2005). The quinonemethide triterpenoids of the Celastra- ceae family have a variety of biological activities, such as 0887-2333/$ - see front matter � 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Maytenus ilicifolia Martius (Celastraceae) is popularly known as ‘‘espinheira santa”, being well known for allevi- ating stomach pain, nausea and treating ulcers and gastritis (Camparoto et al., 2002). In vivo studies have proved the eﬀectiveness of M. ilicifolia in ethanol- and/or indometha- cin-induced gastric lesion models (Bersani-Amado et al., 2000). Pristimerin (Fig. 1) (20a-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-24-nor-frie- dela-1-10,3,5,7-tetraen-carboxylic acid-29-methylester) is a quinonemethide triterpenoid, which in nature is restricted to the Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families (Dirsch et al., 1997). Dirsch et al. (1997) demonstrated that pristim- erin inhibits the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by a mechanism that involves inhibition of NFKB activation, thereby contributing to its anti-inﬂammatory activity. It is also known that pristimerin exhibits cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines (Chang et al., 2003). However, the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic eﬀect of pristimerin has not been completely explored. In 2005, Wu et al. (2005), observed that human breast cancer cells (MDA/ MB-231) treated with pristimerin showed the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and a decrease of mito- chondrial membrane potential leading to apoptosis. More recently, Yang et al. (2008) demonstrated that pristimerin induces death of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) by its potent proteasomal inhibition. Although this compound has a variety of reported bio- logical activities, the eﬀect of pristimerin on human leuke- mia cell lines and the underlying mechanism of action have never been investigated. In this way, the aim of the present work was to determine the antiproliferative eﬀects of pri- stimerin on diﬀerent human cancer cell lines and in periph- eral blood monocluear cells (PBMC). Its mechanism of action was also evaluated in leukemia cancer cell line HL-60. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Extraction and isolation of pristimerin Dried and powdered root bark of M. ilicifolia (900.0 g) was extracted with EtOH. The resulting EtOH extract was ﬁltered and concentrated in vacuo to aﬀord a brown gum (606.0 g), which was submitted to liquid-liquid partition- ing. The CH2Cl2 soluble part of the EtOH extract was con- centrated in vacuo (121.0 g), submitted to a silica gel column chromatography (700 g, 70–230 mesh) with hex- ane/EtOAc gradient elution, yielding 43 fractions (A1– A43). Fraction A10–A14 (2.88 g) was submitted to ﬂash sil- ica gel column chromatography (230–400 mesh) with hex- ane/EtOAc gradient elution, resulting in 38 fractions (B1–B38). Fraction B12–B14 (0.609 g) was submitted to preparatory reverse phase HPLC [MeOH:H2O (7:3), c = 420 nm, 10 mL/min] to aﬀord pristimerin (retention time = 21.0 min; 0.310 g; MW = 464.6). 2.2. Cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines The cytotoxic potential of pristimerin was evaluated by the MTT assay (Mosmann, 1983), against ﬁve human tumor cell lines: HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), K-562 (chronic myelocytic leukemia), SF-295 (glyoblastoma), HCT-8 (colon cancer) and MDA/MB-435 (melanoma), all obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 lg/mL streptomycin, at 37 �C with 5% CO2. Tumor cell growth was quantiﬁed by the ability of living cells to reduce the yel- low dye 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetra- zolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product (Mosmann, 1983). Brieﬂy, cells were plated in 96-well plates (0.7 � 105 cells/well for adherent cells and 0.3 � 105 cells/well for suspended cells) and pristimerin (0.08–53.7 lM) dissolved in DMSO 1% was added to each well. After 69 h of incubation, the supernatant was replaced by fresh medium containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL). Three hours later, the MTT formazan product was dis- solved in 150 lL DMSO, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (DTX-880, Beckman Coulter�). Doxorubicin was used as positive control. The cytotoxicity of pristimer- in was also evaluated after 24 h of incubation in order to establish the concentrations for the studies in HL-60 cells. 2.3. Inhibition of PBMC proliferation – Alamar Blue assay In order to investigate the selectivity of pristimerin toward a normal proliferating cell, the Alamar Blue assay was performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 72 h drug exposure. Heparinized blood (from healthy, non-smoker donors who had not taken any drug at least 15 days prior to sampling) was collected and O H O CH3 C H3 CH3 CH3 CH3 C H3 O O CH3 H Fig. 1. Structure of pristimerin isolated from M. ilicifolia. P.M. Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 855 PBMC were isolated by a standard method of density-gra- dient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque. PBMC were washed and resuspended at a concentration of 3 � 105 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 lg/mL streptomycin at 37 �C with 5% CO2. Phytohemagglutinin (3%) was added at the beginning of culture. After 24 h, the compound (0.08–53.7 lM) dis- solved in DMSO 1% were added to each well and incu- bated for 72 h. Doxorubicin (0.02–8.6 lM) was used as positive control. Control groups received the same amount of DMSO. Twenty-four hours before the end of the incuba- tion, 10 lL of stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of the Alamar Blue (Resazurin, Sigma–Aldrich Co) was added to each well. The absorbance was measured using a multiplate reader (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter�) and the drug eﬀect was quantiﬁed as the percentage of con- trol absorbance at 570 nm and 595 nm. The absorbance of Alamar Blue in culture medium is measured at a higher wavelength and a lower wavelength. The absorbance of the medium is also measured at the higher and lower wave- lengths. The absorbance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absorbance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the higher wavelength. This value is called AOHW. The absor- bance of the medium alone is subtracted from the absor- bance of medium plus Alamar Blue at the lower wavelength. This value is called AOLW. A correction factor R0 can be calculated from AOHW and AOLW, where R0 = AOLW/AOHW. The percent Alamar Blue reduced then is expressed as follows: % reduced = ALW�(AHW � R0) � 100. 2.4. Study of the mechanism involved in the leukemia cell (HL-60) cytotoxicity The following experiments were performed in order to investigate the mechanism involved in the cytotoxic eﬀect of pristimerin against HL-60 cells using a 24 h exposure. Pristimerin dissolved in sterilized DMSO (vehicle control) was added to cell cultures of HL-60 cells (3 � 105 cells/ mL) to obtain ﬁnal concentrations of 0.4, 0.8 and 1.7 lM, corresponding to IC50/2, IC50 and two times IC50 values obtained by the MTT assay after 24 h of incubation. Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) was used as a positive control. 2.4.1. Trypan blue exclusion Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test (Renzi et al., 1993) after incubation of HL- 60 cells with pristimerin. Aliquots from wells were removed from cultures after 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation and cells were scored in a Neubauer chamber. 2.4.2. Inhibition of DNA synthesis HL-60 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (2 mL/well) and treated with pristimerin. Before the end of a 24 h drug exposure, 20 lL of 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 mM) was added to each well and incubated for 3 h at 37 �C. To determine the amount of BrdU incorpo- rated into DNA (Pera et al., 1977), cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, and allowed to dry for 2 h at room temperature. Cells that had incorporated BrdU were labeled by direct peroxidase immunocytochemistry, using the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and covers- lipped. The determination of BrdU positivity was per- formed by light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Two hundred cells were counted per sample to determine the percentage of BrdU-positive cells. 2.4.3. DNA relaxation assay The inhibitory eﬀects of pristimerin (10 and 20 lM) on human Topo I were measured using Topo I Drug Screen- ing Kit (TopoGEN, Inc.). Supercoiled (Form I) plasmid DNA (250 ng) was incubated with human Topo I (4 units) at 37 �C for 30 min in relaxation buﬀer (10 mM Tris buﬀer pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 mM spermidine and 5% glycerol) in the absence or presence of 10 and 20 lM pristimerin (ﬁnal 20 lL). Campothecin (0.1 mM) was used as positive control. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10% SDS (2 lL). Proteinase K (50 lg/mL) was added and incubated at 37 �C for 30 min. DNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel for 120 min at room temperature, and visual- ized with ethidium bromide. 2.4.4. Analysis of morphological changes Untreated or pristimerin-treated HL-60 cells were exam- ined for morphological changes by light microscopy (Metr- impex Hungary/PZO-Labimex Modelo Studar lab�). To evaluate morphology, cells were harvested, transferred to cytospin slides, ﬁxed with ethanol for 1 min and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H/E). Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) was used as a positive control. 2.4.5. Morphological analysis with ﬂuorescence microscopy Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining (McGahon et al., 1995) of HL-60 cells was performed to evaluate the cell death pattern induced by increasing con- centrations of pristimerin. Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) was used as a positive control. After 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation, cells were pelleted and each sample was mixed with 1 lL of aqueous AO/EB solution (100 lg/mL of AO in PBS; 100 lg/mL EB in PBS) just prior to ﬂuorescence micros- copy and quantiﬁcation (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Three hundred cells were counted per sample and scored as fol- lows: viable cells, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells (Geng et al., 2003; Cury-Boaventura et al., 2004). 2.4.6. Flow cytometry analysis 2.4.6.1. Cell membrane integrity. HL-60 cell membrane integrity was evaluated by the exclusion of propidium iodide (50 lg/mL). Cell ﬂuorescence was then determined by ﬂow cytometry in a Guava EasyCyte Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were 856 P.M. Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 evaluated per experiment and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis. 2.4.6.2. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. HL-60 cells were incubated at 25 �C for 30 min, in the dark, in a lysis solution containing 0.1% citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 lg/mL propidium iodide. Cell ﬂuorescence was then determined by ﬂow cytometry in a Guava EasyCyte Mine using Guava Express Plus software. Five thousand events were evaluated per experiment and cellular debris was omitted from the analysis. 2.5. Statistical analysis For cytotoxicity assays, the IC50 values and their 95% conﬁdence intervals were obtained by nonlinear regression using the Graphpad program (Intuitive Software for Sci- ence, San Diego, CA). In order to determine diﬀerences, data were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman–Keuls test (P < 0.01). 3. Results 3.1. Cytotoxicity assays The MTT analysis showed that pristimerin exhibited cytotoxic activity against all ﬁve cancer cell lines. Based on data collected from two independent experiments car- ried out in triplicate, the IC50 values ranged from 0.55 to 3.2 lM in MDA/MB-435 and K-562, respectively, after 72 h of incubation with pristimerin (Table 1). The IC50 val- ues obtained in PBMC for pristimerin and doxorubicin were 0.88 (0.75–1.03) and 1.66 (0.89–3.10) lM, respec- tively, also after 72 h of incubation. All subsequent experiments were conducted on HL-60 cell lines to determine the mechanism of action of pristim- erin in this cell line. 3.2. Pristimerin reduces cell viability and inhibits DNA synthesis Pristimerin produced a signiﬁcant decrease (P < 0.01) in cell viability and increased number of non-viable cells as soon as 6 h exposure, which occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and B). To further under- stand the antiproliferative activity, the incorporation of the nucleoside BrdU into DNA was measured by direct perox- idase immunocytochemistry assay. In Fig. 3, we can see that HL-60 cells treated by pristimerin showed about 30% and 17% of BrdU incorporation at the concentrations of 0.4 and 0.8 lM, respectively (P < 0.01), while doxorubi- cin (0.6 lM) lead to 24% of incorporation. BrdU positive cells in control correspond to 65%. Since pristimerin was able to inhibit DNA synthesis, it could be a suitable candi- date to cause inhibition of topoisomerase. However, pri- stimerin (10 and 20 lM) did not show any eﬀect in the DNA relaxation assay (data not shown). 3.3. Pristimerin alters cell morphology Analysis by H/E of HL-60 treated and untreated cells revealed several drug-induced morphological changes. Con- trol cells exhibited a typical non-adherent and vacuolization round morphology after 24 h in culture (Fig. 4A). The cells treated at all concentrations showed a progressive DNA fragmentation, a reduction in cell volume and destabiliza- tion of the plasma membrane, indicating an increasing pro- gression toward cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C–E). Pyknotic nuclei were observed at higher doses as early as 6 h of treatment. Doxorubicin (0.6 lM) also induced reduction in cell volume, besides nuclear fragmenta- tion and destabilization of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). 3.4. Pristimerin induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells To further determine whether the growth-inhibitory eﬀect of pristimerin was related to the induction of apopto- sis and/or necrosis, treated cells were analyzed using AO/ EB staining by ﬂuorescence microscopy and the numbers of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells were determined. After treatment with the compound, a decreasing number of viable cells (Fig. 5A) and an increasing number of apop- totic cells (Fig. 5B) were observed in a dose-dependent manner. As early as 6 h of pristimerin (0.4 lM) exposure (P < 0.01), apoptosis was observed. Regarding necrosis, a signiﬁcant increase was seen at 0.8 lM after 6 h of treat- ment (Fig. 5C), while extensive cell damage indicative of necrosis occurred only at 1.7 lM after 24 h (P < 0.01). 3.5. Pristimerin disrupts cell membrane integrity The propidium iodide intercalation test showed that pri- stimerin caused disruption of the cell membrane in HL-60 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). The results revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in cell viability starting at 0.8 lM Table 1 Cytotoxic activity of pristimerin in tumor cell lines Substance CI50 (lg/ml (lM))a HL-60 K-562 MDA/MB- 435 SF-295 HCT-8 Doxorubicin 0.02 (0.04) 0.14 (0.24) 0.48 (0.83) 0.23 (0.40) 0.01 (0.02) 0.01–02 0.09–23 0.34–0.66 0.19– 0.25 0.01– 0.02 Pristimerin 0.61 (1.31) 1.49 (3.20) 0.26 (0.55) 0.57 (1.22) 0.69 (1.48) 0.56– 0.67 1.17– 1.90 0.20–0.34 0.38– 0.85 0.59– 0.82 a Data are presented as IC50 values and 95% conﬁdence intervals for leukemia (HL-60, K562), breast (MDA/MB-435), glyoblastoma (SF-295) and colon (HCT-8) human cancer cells. Doxorubicin was used as positive control. Experiments were performed in triplicate. P.M. Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 857 after 12 h and 24 h exposure with percent inhibition values of 18% and 25%, respectively. This activity was also shown to be dependent on time exposure (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). 3.6. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was examined by ﬂow cytometry in HL-60 cells. All DNA that was sub-dip- loid in size was considered fragmented. All concentrations of pristimerin tested led to a signiﬁcant increase in DNA fragmentation (P < 0.01) in a time- and dose-dependent way. After 12 h of exposure, pristimerin at all concentra- tions produced a peak of DNA fragmentation (38.43%, 68.23% and 79% for 0.4, 0.8 and 1.7 lM, respectively) (Fig. 6B). 4. Discussion Various compounds derived from plant secondary metabolites are commonly used in cancer chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, camptothecin and tenoposide. Chemo- therapy has been improved over the past years, but until now, many cancer patients fail chemotherapy, mainly because of side eﬀects or multi-drug resistance. Moreover, it is important to ﬁnd new molecules with activity against cancer with more speciﬁc eﬀects (Kamb, 2005). In this con- text, many researches have found bioactive metabolites in plants of the Celastraceae family with antitumor (quinon- emethide triterpens) and cytotoxic (triterpene dimers) activities (Shirota et al., 1994), which makes these com- pounds promising new anti-cancer drug candidates. In this work, we investigated the eﬀect of pristimerin iso- lated from M. ilicifolia in ﬁve human tumor cell lines (HL- 60, HCT-8, SF-295, MDA/MB-435 and K-562) and in nor- mal proliferating PBMC.

Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 action of pristimerin was further evaluated in the promyel- ocitic leukemia cell line HL-60. In the ﬁrst part of this study, pristimerin showed high cytotoxicity against all cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.55 lM (MDA/MB- 435) to 3.2 lM (K-562) after 72 h. Gonc�alves de Lima et al. (1971) and Setzer et al. (1998) also demonstrated that quinonemethide triterpenoids isolated from the Celastraceae family inhibits cell growth. Our study also corroborates the ﬁndings of Wu et al. (2005) showing that pristimerin inhibits cell growth of cancer cell lines: A-549 (lung), MCF-7 (breast), HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma) and Hep3B (liver) with IC50 values ranging from 0.42 to 0.61 lM. In the present work, we also demonstrated that pristimerin was cytotoxic to PBMC in the same concentration range than to leukemia cells, suggesting a poor selectivity of this compound. When considering the chemotherapy side eﬀects, it is very impor- tant to verify whether the drug shows a harmful eﬀect against normal dividing cells such as proliferating lymphocytes (Zuco et al., 2002; Anazetti et al., 2003). Mammalian cells provide an excellent tool for study- ing cytotoxic substances, where the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line is one of the most often used model for this purpose (Collins, 1987; Milita˜o et al., 2006). In try- ing to identify the mechanism of action involved in the Fig. 4.

Magniﬁcation, 400�. P.M. Costa et al. / Toxicology in Vitro 22 (2008) 854–863 859 antiproliferative eﬀects of pristimerin, we assessed changes in cell viability and morphology (induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis) and inhibition of DNA synthesis and topoisomerase activity. First, the antiproliferative action was conﬁrmed by the trypan blue exclusion assay, which is a suitable and useful test to determine eﬀects on cell proliferation and viability (Renzi et al., 1993). At all concentrations tested, pristimer- in reduced the number of viable cells, which was more evi- dent at higher concentrations (0.8 and 1.7 lM). These results are consistent with the MTT ﬁndings and ﬂow cytometry. The antiproliferative eﬀects were further investigated to determine the mechanism underlying pristimerin cytotoxic- ity. DNA synthesis was aﬀected by treatment with pristim- erin at all concentrations in a dose-dependent way, with extensive cell destruction at 1.7 lM, which made quantiﬁ- cation diﬃcult. Current cancer chemotherapy drugs such as intercalating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors can inhibit DNA synthesis. This inhibition can be due to sev- eral cellular processes such as DNA topology state. More- over, topoisomerase plays an important role by altering the topological state of DNA in events such as overwinding, underwinding, and catenation, and it is involved in prolif- erative processes such as DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and chromosome segregation. We investi- gated the eﬀect of pristimerin on topoisomerase I activity, since this enzyme can be a primordial target for the action 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 Pristimerin (μM) * * * * * * * * * * * Number of viable cells 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 Pristimerin (μM) * * * * * * * * * * * Number of apoptotic cells 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 6 12 24 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 Pristimerin (μM) * * * * * * Number of necrotic cells Fig. 5.

However, pristimerin was not able to inhibit human topo- isomerase I activity indicating that the antiproliferative mechanism of pristimerin is probably due to alterations in another pathway. In order to determine the mechanism of cell death, alter- ations in cell morphology were examined. Some authors have considered the distinction between apoptosis and necrosis diﬃcult and controversial. According to Masque- lier et al. (2004), the morphological deﬁnition is commonly based on membrane integrity. Dartsch et al. (2002) and Schultz and Harrington (2003) considered crucial points for distinguishing apoptosis from necrosis: an early occur- rence of nuclear and DNA fragmentation concomitant with membrane integrity, showing apoptotic bodies, phos- phatidylserine externalization, reduction of nuclear volume and chromatin condensation. Generally, induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is a great beneﬁt for cancer chemo- therapy (Reddy et al., 2003). In the morphological studies, appreciable DNA frag- mentation was observed at the all doses, with highest one revealing signs of extensive destabilization of the plasma membrane with loss of integrity, reduction of cell volume and pyknotic nuclei typical of necrotic processes (Hannun, 1997; Desoize and Sen, 1992). As seen in cytometry analy- sis, pristimerin induced an increase in sub-G1 population cells, which was concentration and time-dependent, sug- gesting that cells underwent DNA fragmentation, an important hallmark of apoptosis. Moreover, in AO/EB ﬂuorescence experiments, pristimerin treated cells dis- played characteristics of apoptosis as fragmented and con- densed nuclei and a brilliant intense green ﬂuorescence, with exception of 24 h exposure at 1.7 lM, which revealed necrosis as probably the result of late apoptosis. These ﬁndings are in agreement with those reported by Wu et al. (2005) who showed that pristimerin causes apoptosis induction in MDA/MB-231 cells triggering a rapid and time-dependent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria within 0.5 h and activation of caspase-3, acting by the intrinsic pathway. In conclusion, the present data point to the importance of pristimerin, a quinonemethide triterpenoid, as representa- C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 0 20 40 60 80 100 6h 12h 24h Pristimerin * * * * * * Viable Cells (%) C D 0.4 0.8 1.7 0 20 40 60 80 100 6h 12h 24h (μM) (μM) Pristimerin * * * * * * * * * * DNA fragmentation (%) Fig. 6.
