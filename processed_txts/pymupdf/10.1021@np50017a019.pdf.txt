From 21 different Croto?i species studied, we have  selected nine to report on in this work: C. soiideriiiitiis, C. esseqiiiboensis, C. iirggrophyl-  loides, C. iifiiiis iniicroiiifoliiis, C .  riiciijiii$oliiis, C. ?iepetiiefoliirs, C. jiicobineiisis, C. viiccins  and C. zeiintiieri; in the latter species at least two varieties were detected as far as  the cliemical composition is concerned.  The isolated oils were analyzed by gcims  with open tubular glass column coripled to a data processing system. Library search  programs for identification of essential oils constituents were developed; algorithms  were used for computation of chromatographic retention times (Kovat's indexes)  and simplified mass spectra (msj. Confirmations were made by comparison of full  ms or other spectroscopic data with that of standard samples w-henever available.  Library search programs rising mass spectral data and Kovat's indexes were found to be  an elficient method for identification of chemical constituents in essential oil analysis.  Before 19'73 very little information was available about odoriferous flora of  northeastern Brazil. At the present time over t\vo hundred essential oils from  different plants are under pharmacological and chemical screening as n-ell as  botanical investigation.  In the Euphorbiaceae family, the genus Crototz, due to high incidence and  species dispersion, contains by far the largest number of essential oil producing  plants in the Brazilian northeast.  This communication describes library search programs based on gas chroma-  t,ography (gc) and mass spectrometric data developed for essential oil analysis  and its application to the investigation of ten samples ext'racted from Brazilian  Euphorbiaceae genus Croton ; C. argyroplzylloirles Muell.

Among several works (5-11) dealing ivith retention index coupled to mass  spectral data in library search programs, only one is concerned with identificat,ions  of lower terpenoids and sesquiterpenoids and uses 12-heptyl acetate (= 1.OUO) as  internal standard to calculate retention times (10).  After creating a library of 200 ent,ries and developing a library search program  based on mass spectral data for identificat'ion of components in essential oils (12),  we found it necessary to improve the program with the inclusion of retention  indexes.  To minimize the standard deviation arising from employing a sole subst'ance  as internal standard, we decided to employ a retention index, namely, Kovat's  Index (13) obtained by use of a mixture of the essential oil with eight n-alkanes  ((28, Cg, (310,  (311, C12, C,,  (316 and (218) as internal standards. This approach  greatly improved the identification, especially for those compounds with very  similar fragmentation patterns.

The mixture u-as then injected in a gc ms equipped with an  open tubular glass column and a data processing system. For comparision  purposes. separated runs of ti-alkanes and the essential oil were made.  Reconstructed mass chromatograms of the ti-alkanes were obtained by use of  the ion m z 85 (11). The computer reconstructed gc of t,he essential oil was  obtained by mas chromatography with ion m z 91, which was always present  in terpenes. sesqu terpenes, their oxygenated derivatives, and aromatic compounds  commonlp found in the essential oils (12). The relative intensity of ion m z 91  in these substances never fell below 30% of the base peak.  Alas:; chromatography of the ions m z S5 and m, z 91 made it possible to  obtain, with a single injection of the essential oil plus n-alkanes, information  usually obtained with more than two injections, such as:  the computer plot of the total ion current of the mixture (see fig. 1 as an  example).

EXTRACTION.-Essential  oil extraction was carried out by steam distillation of finely  ground plant material (16). The yields (volume/volume) are reported in the text. Each  essential oil, after separation, was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and sealed in  glass vials under nitrogen atmosphere.  AxaYsIs.-The  fresh oils were analyzed on a FINKIGAN 3300 quadrupole mass spec-  trometer coupled to a gas chromatograph with an open tubular glass column (30m x 0.25mm id)  with SP 2100 as the stationary phase with helium as the carrier gas. On line mass chroma-  tography computations were made on a 6115 Finnigan data processing system with 32 K con-  figurations v.-ith the aid of 3 megabite disk, magnetic tapes and the library search programs  described here (17).  The nmr data were obtained in a I‘arian EM 360 and Varian XL 100 nmr instruments.
