The simultaneous resolution of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO diastereoisomers was performed on a CHIRALPAK® AS column using a mobile phase of hexane:ethanol:methanol (92:6:2, v/v/v) + 0.5% diethylamine; UV detection was carried out at 262 nm. Diethyl ether was used as extractor solvent. The validated method was used to evaluate the biotransformation of THD by 12 endophytic fungi isolated from Tithonia diversifolia, Viguiera arenaria and Viguiera robusta. Among the 12 fungi evaluated, 4 of them deserve prominence for presenting an evidenced stereoselective biotransfor- mation potential: Phomopsis sp. (TD2) presented greater mono-2-sulfoxidation to the form (S)-(SE) (12.1%); Glomerella cingulata (VA1) presented greater mono-5-sulfoxidation to the forms (S)-(SE) + (R)-(FE) (10.5%); Diaporthe phaseolorum (VR4) presented greater mono-2-sulfoxidation to the forms (S)-(SE) and (R)-(FE) (84.4% and 82.5%, respectively) and Aspergillus fumigatus (VR12) presented greater mono-2-sulfoxidation to the forms (S)-(SE) and (R)-(SE) (31.5% and 34.4%, respectively). © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction Microorganisms have been used to produce chemicals, pharmaceuticals and perfumes for decades [1,2] and also for pollutants degradation and recovery of the environment contaminated by chemicals [3]. The use of microorganisms can simplify or in some instances even enable the produc- tion process of complex chemicals and drug intermediates. In addition, they can add stereospeciﬁcity to the process, eliminating the need for complicated separation and puriﬁ- cation steps. However, the use of microorganisms by the industry to obtain interesting compounds is still modest, con- ∗ Corresponding author. Tel.: +55 16 3602 4261; fax: +55 16 3602 4880.

Another interesting use of microorganisms is for studying biotransformation of drugs and other chemicals such as pesti- cides. The microbial biotransformation system is very similar to the mammalian phase I metabolic reactions. Therefore, these in vitro models can be an attractive alternative for tests of new drugs, making possible the production of metabolites in high amounts, facilitating the structural elucidation and toxicological tests [4]. Smith and Rosazza, in the early 1970’s, established the use of microbial models for mammalian metabolism [5,6]. It has been demonstrated that some fungi can generate a similar metabolic proﬁle to mammalian and that the metabolism is also stere- oselective [7]. Since them some studies have been reported 0731-7085/$ – see front matter © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jpba.2007.05.018 946 K.B. Borges et al. / Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis 46 (2008) 945–952 describing the use of fungi for the biotransformation of drugs [8–10]. A special kind of fungi are the endophytic fungi, microorgan- isms that colonize and grow asymptomatically within internal plant tissues without causing harm to their host [11]. To present date, there are few studies using endophytic fungi in stere- oselective biotransformation. Agusta et al. [12] reported the stereoselective oxidation at C-4 of ﬂavans by the endophytic fungus Diaporthe sp. isolated from a tea plant Camelia sinen- sis. Thioridazine (THD), a phenothiazine neuroleptic drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric dis- orders, is commercially available as a racemic mixture of the enantiomers (−)-(S) and (+)-(R). It is extensively metabolized by S-oxidation to thioridazine-5-sulfoxide (THD-5-SO) and thioridazine-2-sulfoxide (THD-2-SO) which is further oxidized to thioridazine-2-sulfone (THD-2-SO2) [13,14,15]. THD-2-SO and THD-2-SO2 are metabolites considered pharmacologically active while THD-5-SO contributes to the cardio toxicity of the drug [16,17]. A summary of rac-thioridazine’s metabolic proﬁle in humans is demonstrated in Fig. 1. THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO exist as two diastereoisomeric pairs, referred to fast-eluting (FE) THD-2-SO and slow-eluting (SE) THD-2-SO, and fast-eluting THD-5-SO and slow-eluting THD-5-SO, respectively, based on their chromatography properties [18,19]. The (R) and (S) con- ﬁgurations of THD and their metabolites are related to the chiral carbon at position 2 in the piperidyl ring [19]. Considering that THD metabolites are also therapeutically active, but with undesirable side effects that can be attributed to speciﬁcstereoisomers,thestudyofitsmetabolismbyendophytic fungi can be useful to obtain THD metabolites in the enantiomer- ically pure form and further accomplishment of clinical and/or toxicological studies. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to develop a method for the stereoselective analysis of THD-2-SO and THD- 5-SO in culture medium and to study the biotransformation of rac-thioridazine (THD) by some endophytic fungi. Although the stereoselective analyses of THD and/or its metabolites have already been described in the literature, none of the methods reported allows the simultaneous resolution of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO stereoisomers [18,20–22]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Standard solutions and chemicals rac-thioridazine, thioridazine-2-sulfoxide and thioridazine- 5-sulfoxide were kindly supplied by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland). Stock standard solutions were prepared in methanol at concentrations of 2.00, 4.00, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 80.0, 200 and 400 �g mL−1 and were stored at −20 ◦C in the absence of light. It is important to mention that the drugs used in the present work consist of the FE pair of enantiomers for THD-2-SO (racemic mixture of (R)-THD-2-SO (FE) and (S)-THD-2-SO (FE)) and of the SE pair of enantiomers for THD-5-SO (racemic mixture of (R)-THD-5-SO (SE) and (S)- THD-5-SO (SE)). HPLC-grade hexane, methanol, diethyl ether were purchased from Mallinckrodt Baker Inc. (Paris, France) and ethanol from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All other chem- icals were of analytical-grade in the highest purity available. Water was distilled and puriﬁed using a Millipore Milli Q Plus system (Bedford, USA). 2.2. Instrumentation and analytical conditions The analyses were carried out using a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) HPLC system, consisting of a LC 10 AS model solvent pump, a Rheodyne model 7125 injector with a 50 �L loop, a SPD-10 A UV–vis detector operating at 262 nm and a CR6-A modelintegrator.ThesimultaneousresolutionofTHD-2-SOand THD-5-SO stereoisomers was performed on a CHIRALPAK® AS column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, i.d., 10 �m particle size, Chiral Technologies, Exton, USA), protected with a 4 mm × 4 mm RP- 8 endcapped guard column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), using a mobile phase consisting of hexane:ethanol:methanol (92:6:2, v/v/v) and 0.5% diethylamine at a ﬂow rate of 1.4 mL min−1. Fig. 1. Molecular structure of thioridazine, thioridazine-2-sulfoxide and thioridazine-5-sulfoxide (the chiral centers are indicated by an asterisk). K.B. Borges et al. / Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis 46 (2008) 945–952 947 The analyses were carried out in an acclimatized room with the temperature set at 23 (±2) ◦C. 2.3. Extraction procedure Duringtheextractionprocedure,somespecialcarewastaken: the solutions were protected from light sources by maintaining windows blinds closed to prevent photo degradation [20,21,22] and the room temperature was set at 20 ◦C in order to pre- vent solvent evaporation during sample preparation. Aliquots of 1 mL of medium (see 2.6 item) spiked with 25 �L of standard solutions of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO (or samples obtained in the biotransformation process) were alkalinized with 200 �L 4 mol L−1 sodium hydroxide solution and extracted with 3 mL diethyl ether. The tubes were capped and submitted to vortex mixing for 2 min and then centrifuged at 1800 × g for 5 min. The upper organic phases (2 mL) were transferred to conical tubes and evaporated under nitrogen. The residues were dissolved in 100 �L of the mobile phase and 50 �L were chromatographed. 2.4. Method validation Calibrations curves were obtained by spiking aliquots of 1 mL medium with standard solutions of rac-THD-2-SO (FE) and rac-THD-5-SO (SE), prepared in methanol, in the range of 2.00–400 �g mL−1, resulting in concentrations of 25.0–5000 ng mL−1 for each enantiomer. No internal standard was used in this method. To determine the extraction recovery, medium samples (1 mL) were spiked with THD-2-SO (FE) and THD-5-SO (SE) enantiomers in the concentrations of 125, 500 and 2500 ng mL−1 for each enantiomer (n = 3) and submitted to the extractor pro- cedure. Another set of samples were prepared extracting 1 mL aliquots of medium and them spiking the extract with the same amount of THD-2-SO (FE) and THD-5-SO (SE) enantiomers. The recovery was determined by comparing the areas obtained before and after extraction and was expressed as percentage of the amount extracted. The detectability of the method was evaluated by determining the quantiﬁcation limit (LOQ). The LOQ was deﬁned as the lowest stereoisomer concentration that could be determined with accuracy and precision below 20% [23] over ﬁve analytical run and it was obtained using medium samples (1 mL, n = 5) spiked with concentrations of 25.0 ng mL−1 of each enantiomer. The precision and accuracy of the method were evaluated by within-day (n = 5) and between-day (n = 3) assays using medium samples spiked with THD-2-SO (FE) and THD-5-SO (SE) at the concentrations of 125, 500 and 2500 ng mL−1 of each stereoisomer. The results obtained were expressed as coefﬁcient of variation (CV, %) and relative error (E, %). Theselectivityofthemethodwasevaluatedbyanalyzingster- ile medium, sterile medium added of N,N-dimethylformamide and endophytic fungal mycelium under the conditions pre- viously established. We have already studied the stability of thioridazine and its metabolites in previous studies [20,21,22]. Among the parameters studied (pH, temperature and light), the exposition to light was the only one that resulted in epimeriza- tion of THD-5-SO and THD-2-SO. So in the present study, all experiments were carried out in the light absence. 2.5. Elution order for THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO enantiomers The elution order for THD-2-SO (FE) and THD-5-SO (SE) stereoisomers was established based on the method reported by Eap et al. [18,24]. Twenty-ﬁve microliters of standard methanol solutions of THD-2-SO (FE) and THD-5-SO (SE) were trans- ferred to tubes, the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen and the residues were dissolved in the mobile phase and analyzed by HPLC. To obtain the other stereoisomers (THD-2-SO (SE) and THD-5-SO (FE)), the tubes with standard methanol solu- tions of THD-2-SO (FE) and THD-5-SO (SE) were exposed to UV light (254 nm) during 4 h [20,21,22]. A CHIRALPAK® AS column and a mobile phase consisting of hexane:ethanol (81:19, v/v) containing 0.2% diethylamine, at ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 [18,24] were used for the resolution of THD- 2-SO (FE) stereoisomers. For THD-5-SO (SE) stereoisomers, a Chiralcel OD column and a mobile phase consisting of hex- ane:ethanol (85:15, v/v) and 0.05% diethylamine, at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 were used [18]. The separated stereoisomers of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO were collected at the end of the columns, the solvent was evaporated and the residues were ana- lyzed according to the conditions described in the present paper. 2.6. Endophytic fungi isolation and THD biotransformation The fungi utilized in these experiments were previously isolated as endophytes from the plants Tithonia diversifolia, Viguiera robusta and Viguiera arenaria (Asteraceae). Cultures of endophytes were maintained on potato dextrose agar slants and store at 4 ◦C. The strains have been deposited in the “Lab- orat´orio de Enzimologia Industrial—FCFRP/USP”. An initial screening of twelve strains of endophytic fungi was performed to evaluate if they were able to produce mammalian metabo- lites of THD, allowing us to select four of them were selected for this study. The selected strains were Phomopsis sp. (TD2), isolated from T. diversifolia, Glomerella cingulata (VA1), iso- lated from V. arenaria, Diaporthe phaseolorum (VR4) and Aspergillus fumigatus (VR12) both isolated from V. robusta. All fungi were identiﬁed utilizing molecular biology techniques (data not shown). The fungi were cultured using a two-step process. First, suspension mycelium was aseptically inoculated into 125 mL Erlenmeyers ﬂasks containing 25 mL of seed medium [25]. The ﬂasks were incubated for 2 days (48 h) at 30 ◦C on a rotary shaker (New Brunswick Scientiﬁc Co., Inc., model INNOVATM 4300, New Jersey, USA) operating at 120 rpm (preculture). The resulting mycelia were harvested, rinsed and transferred into 125 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 50 mL of Czapek medium [26] adjusted to pH 5.0 and then 1 mg of THD dis- solved in 100 �L of N,N-dimethylformamide was added to each ﬂask. Control ﬂasks consisted of culture broth without THD and fungi, only sterile medium with N,N-dimethylformamide, sterile medium with N,N-dimethylformamide and THD, sterile 948 K.B. Borges et al. / Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis 46 (2008) 945–952 medium with N,N-dimethylformamide and endophytic fungal mycelium (each endophytic fungus studied). Biotransformation experiments were carried out at 30 ◦C, with shaking at 120 rpm for additional 48 h in light absence. Aliquots of the ﬁltrates (1 mL) were submitted to extraction procedure and analyzed by chiral HPLC. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Method validation The chiral resolution of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO has already been studied by our group. De Gaitani et al. [21] reported a method for the stereoselective analysis of THD-5-SO in human plasma by capillary electrophoresis using hydroxypropyl-β- cyclodextrin and sulfated-β-cyclodextrin as chiral selectors. Further, the degradation and epimerization THD-2-SO in human plasma, buffer and methanolic solutions were studied using an enantioselective HPLC method with a Chiralpak AD [22]. Unfortunately, these methods are suitable only for the resolu- tion of the isolated metabolites. The analysis of THD and/or its metabolites has also been discussed by other groups, using sequential achiral and chiral separations, with the peaks manu- ally collected [18,27,28]. We have also observed that among the several chiral stationary phases based on polysaccharide derivatives, the amylose derived phases resulted in better reso- lution for THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO stereoisomers [18,24,29]. So, a CHIRALPAK® AS column, an amylose-based chiral sta- tionary phase (tris ((S)-�-methylbenzylcarbamate derivative of amylose)), was evaluated for the simultaneous resolution of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO stereoisomers. The optimized chro- matographic conditions are described on Table 1 as well as the obtained chromatographic parameters. Under these chro- matographic conditions THD elutes at 2.0 min and THD-2-SO2, another THD metabolite, elutes at 13.4 min and do not interfere with the analysis of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO stereoisomers. Fig. 2A shows the chromatograms referring to the separation of THD-2-SO (FE) and THD-5-SO (SE). Fig. 2B shows the chromatograms referring to the separation of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO exposed to UV light. In addition, the chromatogram of THD-5-SO stereoisomers in the chiral column showed only three peaks due to coelution of (R)-THD-5-SO (SE) and (S)- THD-5-SO (FE). The validation of the method was performed only for THD- 2-SO (FE) and THD-5-SO (SE) enantiomers because the other pairs of enantiomers (THD-2-SO (SE) and THD-5-SO (FE)) were not available. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 25.0–5000 ng mL−1 for (R)-THD-2-SO (FE), (S)-THD-2-SO (FE), (R)-THD-5-SO (SE) and (S)-THD- 5-SO (SE), with correlation coefﬁcients (r) ≥0.9998 (Table 2). The lowest concentration quantiﬁed by the validated method was 25.0 ng mL−1 with coefﬁcient of variation and relative errors lower than 10% and 15%, respectively (Table 2). Recoveries were around 100% for THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO stereoiso- mers with coefﬁcients of variation lower than 15% (Table 3). Within-day (n = 5) and between-day (n = 3) precision and accu- racy presented coefﬁcients of variation and relative errors lower than 10%, respectively (Table 4). In spite of not using an internal standard, the precision results were acceptable. All fungi eval- uated did not produce any secondary metabolites that presented retention times close to those of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO stereoisomers (Fig. 3). 3.2. Biotransformation of THD in mammalian metabolites by endophytic fungi The percentage of metabolites production was calculated considering that 1 mg of THD was added in 50 mL of cul- ture medium (20,000 ng mL−1), resulting in 10,000 ng mL−1 of each enantiomer, (R)-THD and (S)-THD. As mentioned pre- viously, the validation of the method was carried out only for the THD-2-SO (FE) and THD-5-SO (SE) enantiomers pairs. The concentrations for the forms THD-2-SO (SE) and THD- 5-SO (FE) were based on the linear equation of the adjacent peaks. So, the concentration of (R)-THD-2-SO (SE) (peak 2) was determined using the calibration curve of (S)-THD-2-SO (FE) (peak 1) and for the quantiﬁcation of (S)-THD-2-SO (SE) (peak 3), the calibration curve of (R)-THD-2-SO (FE) (peak 4) was used. For THD-5-SO (SE), the calibration curve of (R)- THD-5-SO (SE) (peak 5) was used to quantify (R)-THD-5-SO Table 1 Chromatographic parameters for the chiral separation of THD-2-SO and THD-5-SO stereoisomers on CHIRALPAK® AS column; mobile phase: hexane:ethanol:methanol (92:6:2, v/v/v) + 0.5% DEA; ﬂow rate of 1.4 mL min−1; detection at 262 nm Rs, resolution; k, retention factor for the ﬁrst eluted stereoisomer (tM = 1.94 min, deﬁned as the ﬁrst signiﬁcant baseline disturbance, corresponding to the retention time of a non-retained solute); α, separation factor.

As the method does not discriminate these forms, we are denoting them as (R)-THD-5-SO (SE) + (S)- THD-5-SO(FE).Finally,thecalibrationcurveof(S)-THD-5-SO (SE) (peak 6) was used to quantify (R)-THD-5-SO (FE) (peak 7). The endophytes Phomopsis sp. (TD2), G. cingulata (VA1), D. phaseolorum (VR4) and A. fumigatus (VR12) were able to biotransform THD into the major human metabolites THD-2- SO and THD-5-SO (Fig. 4) by oxidating the sulphur atom in the lateral chain (position 2) or in the phenothiazine ring (position 5). However, the mono-2-sulfoxidation occurred with higher frequency. In addition, (R)-(+)- and (S)-(−)-THD were metab- olized in different patterns. Phomopsis sp. (TD2) presented greater mono-2-sulfoxidation to the forms (S)-(SE) (12.1%); G. cingulata (VA1) presented greater mono-5-sulfoxidation to the forms (S)-(SE) + (R)-(FE) (10.5%); D. phaseolorum (VR4) presented greater mono-2-sulfoxidation to the forms (S)-(SE) and (R)-(FE) (84.4% and 82.5%, respectively) and A. fumi- gatus (VR12) presented greater mono-2-sulfoxidation to the forms (S)-(SE) and (R)-(SE) (31.5% and 34.4%, respectively). The results of the analyses of medium samples are shown on Table 5. Aspergillus sp., Glomerella sp. and Diaporthe sp. have already been used for biotransformation of some other compounds showing high potential for stereoselective oxi- dations. Aspergillus niger converted (−)-menthol to 1-, 2-, 6-, 7- and 9-hydroxymenthol and the mosquito repellent- active 8-hydroxymenthol, whereas (+)-menthol was converted to 7-hydroxymenthol. Aspergillus cellulose biotransformed (−)- menthol speciﬁcally to 4-hydroxymenthol [30]. Miyazawa and Hashimoto [31] reported the resolution of (±)-2- endo-acetoxy-1,8-cineole by G. cingulata resulting (+)-2- endo-acetoxy-1,8-cineole and (−)-2-endo-hydroxy-1,8-cineole in enantiomerically pure form (yield 50%; e.e. 100%). Agusta et al. [12] reported the use of the endophytic fungus Diaporthe sp., isolated from a tea plant C. sinen- sis, for the stereoselective oxidation of (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin.

Conclusions A suitable high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed and validated for the stereoselective determi- nation of thioridazine-2-sulfoxide and thioridazine-5-sulfoxide simultaneously in a fermentative medium. This method was used to study the biotransformation of thior- idazine by endophytic fungi, showing that different metabolites could be obtained by using different types of fungi and that metabolite production was stereoselective. The results reported here could be further used to obtain speciﬁc metabolites for pharmacodynamic, toxicological or other kind of studies. For example, the fungus D. phaseolorum (VR4) can be used to obtain the forms (S)-(SE) and (R)-(FE) (84.4% and 82.5%, respectively) of THD-2-SO.
