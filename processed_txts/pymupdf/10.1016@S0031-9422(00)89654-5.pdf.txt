Abstract--A  new oleanane,  3/?,19z,23,24-tetrahydroxy-12-oleanen-28-oic  acid, was isolated together  with nine known  triterpene  compounds  from the leaves of Alibertia  edulis,  Rubiaceae.  INTRODUCTION  The species of the Rubiaceae  family contain  many iri-  doids,  alkaloids  and  triterpenes,  notably  ursane  and  oleanane  derivatives,  and  their  occurrence  in species  growing  in the Brazilian  ‘Cerrado’  has been reported  [l-33.  AIiberfia  edulis  A. Rich, commonly  known  as  ‘marmel5o’  is a small tree widely spread  in the Go&,  Mato Gross0 and SBo Paula states, in which its ripe fruits  are greatly  appreciated  by their delicious  sweet taste.  Recently,  other  Aliherria  species have been investigated  yielding  iridoids  [4] and  triterpenes  [3]. This paper  describes  the occurrence  of a new oleanane  derivative  from A. edulis  leaves in addition  to nine known  triter-  penes.  RFSULTSANDDISCUSSION  The crude ethanol  extract from Alibertia  edulis leaves  was partitioned  between  hexane,  chloroform  and n-bu-  tanol.  The hexane  extract  was fractionated  by usual  chromatographic  procedures  to afford r-amyrin  (1) and  fi-amyrin  (2). The chloroform  fraction chromatographed  on a silica gel column  afforded  complex  mixtures  of  alcoholic and acidic triterpenes.  The acidic fractions  were  treated with diazomethane  and a mixture of uvaol(3) [5]  and erythrodiol  (4) [6], and a mixture of ursolic (5) and  oleanolic  (6) acid methyl  esters  was isolated  by pre-  parative  TLC. The remaining  fractions  were combined  and submitted  to preparative  TLC furnishing  a mixture  of 23-hydroxyursolic  acid  methyl  ester  (7) and  23-  hydroxyoleanolic  acid methyl ester (methyl-hederaginin,  8) and another  mixture  of 9 and 10. This mixture  after  acetylation  and preparative  reversed-phase  HPLC  gave  9a and lOa, a derivative  of a new triterpene.  *Author to whom correspondence  should be addressed.  Compound  9a was characterized  by its physical  and  spectral  data. This compound  was first isolated  from  CIethra barbinerois,  a Clethraceae  species [7].  The ‘HNMR  spectrum  of 1Oa (Table 1) when com-  pared with the data of 9a showed  very similar spectral  features: two multiplet  signals at S5.00 and 5.42 due to H-  3 and H-12, respectively;  the AB doublets  attributed  to  CH,-23  and CH,-24  were observed  at 64.06 (lH), 4.17  (2H) and 4.26 (1 H). The lowfield region of the spectrum  of  10a showed, besides the above signals, two more at 63.34  and 3.15. These  signals  corresponded  to two coupled  protons  as shown  by a ‘H-‘H  COSY  spectrum.

Values may be reversed  4  proton  with a signal at 6 1.65. The H-18 of oleanolic  acid  occurs approximately  at 63.0, so the signal at 63.15 was  attributed  to this proton  and the one at 63.34 to H-19.  The hydroxyl  at C-19 can be assigned  only IO an axial  position  to justify  both  the small  coupling  observed  between  H-18 and H-19, and the long range coupling  of  H-19 with H-21 (equatorial).  The hindered  C-19 hydroxyl  is in agreement  with the acctylation  of only three hydrox-  yl groups  in 10a.  The ‘“CNMR  spectrum  of 1Oa also showed  a close  structural  resemblance  to 9a when the carbons  of the A  and  B rings  were analysed.  The assignments  of the  remaining  chemical  shifts were achieved  by comparison  with the data of olcanolic  acid methyl ester [8]. In fact, a  /I-deshiclding  effect was observed  for C- 18, C-20 and for  C- I2 and C- 16, due to C- I9 hydroxyl &effects. A strong y-  shielding  effect was observed  for C-29, C-21 and C-13  (Table 1). The molecular  formula, C,,H,,O,  for 1Oa was  supported  by the mass spectral  data.  The presence of oleanolic  and ursolic triterpenes  in the  extracts  of leaves of A. edulis is in agreement  with the  placement  of Aliherria  in the Gardenieae  tribe of the  Rubiaceae  family [9].  EXPERIMENTAL  Plant  material.  AIihertia  edulis A. Rich was collected in  Campo  Grande,  Mato Gross0  do Sul, Brazil in August  1990. A voucher  specimen  (number  10) has been depos-  ited in the herbarium  of the Departamento  de Quimica da  Universidadc  Federal do Mato Gross0 do Sul.  Extraction  and isolation  of the constituents.  Dried and  powdered  leaves (1.5 kg) of A. edulis  were successively  extracted  with hexane. EtOH and EtOH  Hz0 (6:4). The  crude hcxanc extract (I 3.5 g) was fractionated  by silica gel  column  chromatography  yielding  z-  and  P-amyrin  (120 mg), cis- and truns-phytol(80  mg) and fatty material.  The crude ethanolic  extract  (I IO g) was solubilized  in  EtOH- H,O  (9: 1) and partitioned  into hexane  (I2 g).  CHCI, (17.0 g) and n-BuOH (36.5 g). The CHCI,-soluble  part  was submitted  to CC on silica gel eluted  with  CH,CI,  with increasing  amounts  of MeOH.  After TLC,  some frs were combined  and mcthylated  with CH,N,.  Further  CC on silica gel and prep. TLC eluted  with  CH,CI,-  AcOEt (85: 15) and CHCI,-MeOH  (98:2) gave  4 mixts of triterpencs:  3 and 4 (72 mg), 5 and 6 (100 mg), 7  and 8 (32 mg), 9 and 10 (61 mg). The mixt. 9 and 10 was  acetylated  with pyridine--AC,0  at room temp. giving 9a  and  1Oa. The mixt. was submitted  to reversed-phase  HPLC. using McOH  H,O (X:2) as eluent. affording  9a  (22 mg) and 10a (6 mg).  Compound  1Oa.
