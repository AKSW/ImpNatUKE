Abstract-The wood of Platymiscium praecox Mart. (Leguminosae-Lotoideae)  contains sitosterol, 4,2’,4’-  trihydroxychalcone,  (2R)-7_hydroxyflavanone,  (&)-7,4’-dihydroxytlavanone,  (2S,  3S)-3,7-dihydroxy-  flavanone,  3,7_dihydroxyflavone,  3,7,4’-trihydroxyflavone,  6,7-dihydroxy-4’-methoxyisoflavone  and 6 7-  dimethoxycoumarin.  It also contains  three novel compounds:  7-hydroxy-4.methoxy-5-methylcoumarin,  7-U-glucosyloxy4methoxy-5-methylcoumarin  and 7-hydroxy4,8-dimethoxy-5-methylcoumarin.  Platymiscium praecox Mart. (Leguminosae-Lotoideae)  is an arboreous species which occurs  near Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Its trunkwood yielded a series of crystal-  line compounds which were classified by their spectra as a chalcone, three flavanones, two  flavones, an isoflavone and four coumarins.  The chalcone and one of the flavanones were identified with the well known 4,2’,4’-  trihydroxychalcone  (isoliquiritigenin)  and ( f)-7,4’-dihydroxyflavanone  (liquiritigenin)3  through direct comparison with synthetic samples.4*5 The spectral characterization  of the  second flavanone as (2R)-7-hydroxyflavanone  was consubstantiated  by direct comparison  with synthetic ( i)-7-hydroxyflavanone.6-s  The PMR spectrum of the third flavanone included the pair of doublets typical of the  AB system of vicinal protons at positions 2 and 3 of 3-hydroxyflavanones.g  The B part of  this signal was shifted paramagnetically  by l-2 ppm upon acetylation of the compound,  confirming the existence of a secondary carbinol. The remaining features of the PMR  spectrum defined the substitution pattern of the aromatic rings and, in conjunction with  * Part XXXVIII in the series “The Chemistry of Brazilian Leguminosae”.

Only  SYn-  thetic  (-J-)-3,7-dihydroxyflavanone  has been described  previously.”  The  flavones  were  identified  as 3,7_dihydroxyflavone  and  3,7,4’-trihydroxyflavone  by  spectral  means.  The  data  obtained  for  these  isolates  and  for  the derived  acetates  are in  agreement  with the data reported  for synthetic  3,7-dihydroxyflavone,12,13  as well as for  synthetic’”  and natural’5  3,7,4’-trihydroxyflavone.  The PMR  spectrum  of its diacetate  identified  the isoflavone  unequivocally  with 6,7-  dihydroxy-4’“methoxyisofl  atone  (texasin),  previously  detected in Baprisia australis by PC.”  The isolate has a m.p. and gave UV and TR spectra as required by the literature  for synthetic  specimens.‘7-19  One of the four coumarins  of P. praecox was identified  with 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin  (aesculetin  dimethyl  ether) isolated  previously  from plants. 20*Z1 The remaining  three com-  pounds  were immediately  recognized  as unusual : their PMR spectra indicated  in each case  the presence  of a C-methyl  group. This fact, combined  uith elementary,  mass spectral and  functional  analyses,  led to the formula  C9H303 .CH, .0H.0CH3  for one of them. The  hydroxyi  must be placed at a position  such as C-7, conjugated  with the carbonyl,  since upon  methylation  and upon acetylation  a shift of the IR carbonyl  stretching  band from 1700 to  1725 cm-’  was observed.  Two of the three undefined  hydrogens  in the formula  must be  mefa-related  and both vicinal  to the hydroxyl.  In the acetate  they give rise to a pair of  doublets  (J 2.5 HZ) at a significantly  lower field (7 3.10 and 3.25) than in the methyl ether  (2 proton  singlet,  T 3.40). The third hydrogen  was placed at the 3 position  of the hetero-  cycle, in view of the relatively  small chemical  shift of its PMR signal  [s, T 4-50 (methyl  ether), 4.40 (acetate)].  At t.his point two structural  alternatives  (I and Ilb) had to be con-  sidered  for the methyl ether.

Most sig-  nificantly,  the PMR signal due to the C-methyi  group of the synthetic  compound  appeared  as a doublet  (T 7.48, J I.5 Hz) and the vicinal olefinic proton  gave a quartet  (T 4.06, J l-5  Hz), as in other coumarins  and chromones  of this type.
