Abstract-In  the wood  of A&scat&us  ~uusci~oru.s six known  alkaloids  ~-methoxy-2-quinolone,  I-methyl-4-  methoxy-2-quinolone,  dictamine,  skimmianine,  y-fagarine  and  N-methylflindersinc  and  two new dihydro-  cinnamic  acids 3-[2’,6’-dimethoxy-6”,6”-dimethylpyrano(2”,3”:4’,3’)phenyl]-propi~~nic  acid and its methyl  ester  were identified.  The structures  of the dihydrocinnamic  acid derivatives  were confirmed  by “C NMR.  Adiscanthus  fusciflorus  Ducke.  an arboreous  Rutaceae  species  from the Amazon  region,  contains  in a section  of its trunk (bark included)  4-methoxy-2-quinolone,  I-  methyl-4-methoxy-2-quinolone,  dictamine  and skim-  mianine  [3], y-fagarine  [4] and N-methylfiindersine.  All these  alkaloids  have  been  separated  previously  from other  rutaceous  species,  the first four inclusively  from  another  Amazonian  species,  Hortia  longifolia  Spr. ex Engl. [3], and the last one by N-methylation  of  natural  flindersine  [.5]. Their  identification  was based  on  spectra  and  direct  comparison  with  authentic  samples.  Two additional  constituents,  isolated  from the same  extract  of A. fusciporus,  were  the  dihydrocinnamic  acid  derivatives  la and  lb,  which,  jointly  with  dihydrocinnamyl  alcohols  such  as lc 161, had been  previously  found  in Hortia  badinii  M.A. Lisboa.  The  structural  elucidation  of these  natural  products  had  been  based  chiefly  on the interpretation  of ‘H NMR  spectra.  Their re-isolation  was therefore  an opportun-  ity to test the proposed  formulae  by ‘“CNMR.  la R’ = CO,Me,  RZ = OMe  lb R’ = CO,H,  RZ = OMe  lc R’ = CH,OH, RZ = H  The phloroglucinol  type substitution  for la can be  safely  accepted  from  ‘HNMR  evidence  for the sole  aromatic  proton  (6 6.18).

The  signals  due  to the  corresponding  ipso-carbons  (C-  6’ 6 158.5. C-2’ 8 154.9) can be easily assigned  due to  their complex  secondary  splitting  in the fully proton-  coupled  C spectrum.  In this same spectrum,  signals of  the ipso-carbons  C--2” and C-3” show a contrastingly  simpler  splitting  pattern  which  can be eliminated  by  decoupling  respectively  at the resonance  frequencies  of H-4” (double  irradiation  at S 6.48) and H-S” (dou-  ble irradiation  at ii 5.45).  These  decoupling  experi-  ments  were  additionally  very useful in the coniirma-  tion of the respective  assignment  of signals to C-4” and  C,5” since the first order  C-H  couplings  are elimi-  nated.  Finally.  double  irradiation  at the frequency  of  the gem-dimethyl  protons  (6 1.38) collapsed  the fine  splitting  of the C-5” signal, confirming  the vicinality  of  this carbon  and CMe,.  At this stage, since correlation  of signals  to carbons  of the propionic  acid moiety  is  trivial, only the signals at 6 113.7 and 75.5 remained  to be assigned,  a task performed  by comparison  with  model  compounds  2 [7] and 3 [ri]. respectively.  OMe  The  spectrum  of la served  as the  basis  in the  interpretation  of the spectra  of lb, dihydro-lb  and le.  The suppression  of the 4”,5’‘-double  bond  of lb in  dihydro-lb  caused  a paramagnetic  shift of the C-2”  signal  (a8 4.4),  an  expression  of  the  endocyclic  homoallylic  effect  [Yl.

Adiscanthus  fuscifiorus  Ducke  was collected  near  Manaus,  AM  and  identified  by W. A.  Rodrigues,  botanist,  Instituto  National  de  Pesquisas  da  AmazBnia.  Powdered  trunkwood  and bark  (2 kg) were  ex-  tracted  with  EtOH.  The  extract  (20 g) was  suspended  in  hexane,  filtered,  the  hexane  evapd  and  the  residue  (7 g)  submitted  to dry column  chromatography  (Si gel deactivated  with  10%  H,O,  C$H,-CHCI,,  9: 1). The  column  was ex-  truded  and  divided  into  8 equal  parts  which  gave  from  bottom  to top 8 fractions.  Fraction  4 was purified  by TLC (Si  gel, C,H,-EtOAc,  7 : 3) giving la (30 mg). Fractions  5 and 6  were  washed  with hexane  to give lb (200  mg). Fraction  7  contained  1-methyl-4-methoxy-2-quinolone.  The  hexane  insol.  part  of the extract  was suspended  in CHCl,  and fil-  tered.  The CHCl,  was evapd  and the residue  (6 g) submitted  to  Si gel  (120 g) column  chromatography,  elution  with  CHCl,-MeOH,  100:0  to 95 :5, giving  fractions  A to G.  Fraction  B was purified  by TLC (Si gel, C,H,-EtOAc,  4:l)  to give la (60  mg). Fraction  C was separated  by TLC (Si gel,  C,H,-EtOAc,  7:3)  into  dictamine  (20 mg) and  y-fagarine  (60 mg). Fraction  D was purified  similarly  to give N-methyl-  flindersine  (50 mg). Fraction  E was separated  by TLC (Si gel,  C,H,-EtOAc,  3:2) into skimmianine  (20 mg) and l-methyl-  4-methoxy-2-quinolone.  Fraction  G was washed  and tryst.  from EtOH  to give 4-methoxy-2-quinolone.  Fractions  A and  F did not lead to pure compounds.
