E-mail: albjcava@iq.unesp.br Contract/grant sponsor: Biota-FAPESP INTRODUCTION Casearia sylvestris is a medicinal plant native to Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia, where it is known as guaçatonga. The leaves of the plant are popularly used as an antiseptic, a topical anaesthetic and an anti-ulcer agent, and also to heal skin wound diseases (Scavone et al., 1979; Basile et al., 1990). Some of these properties were supported by the studies of Borges et al. (2000, 2001), who demonstrated the inhibition of phospholipase A2 by aqueous extracts of the leaves of C. sylvestris. Furthermore, these aqueous extracts were also able to neutralise proteases from snake venoms. A fraction obtained from the dich- loromethane:methanol extract of leaves of the plant was active against Bacillus cereus (Alves et al., 2000), and an ethanolic extract showed anti-ulcerogenic activity and low toxicity (Basile et al., 1990). The anti-ulcerogenic property was further investigated and conﬁrmed by Sertié et al. (2000). Phytochemical investigation of C. sylvestris led to the isolation of clerodane diterpene classes, the casearins and casearvestrins (Fig. 1), identiﬁed as potential anti- tumour agents (Itokawa et al., 1990; Morita et al., 1991; Carvalho et al., 1998; Oberlies et al., 2002). Some of the casearins also exhibited DNA-damaging activity as determined by bioassays involving mutant strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Carvalho et al., 1998). In these studies, casearins were obtained from the n-hexane fraction of the ethanolic extract (Itokawa et al., 1990; Morita et al., 1991) or from the dichloromethane:methanol (2:1, v/v) extract (Carvalho et al., 1998) of the leaves, whilst casearvestrins were obtained from the methanolic extract of the leaves (Oberlies et al., 2002). The efﬁciency of extraction of the bioactive com- ponents from the medicinal herb is clearly of funda- mental importance if the therapeutic properties of this phytomedicine are to be exploited. The present paper deals with the optimisation of different conditions for the maceration and sonication extraction of casearins from leaves of C. sylvestris using response surface methodology, and an evaluation of the stabilisation procedures to be employed with respect to the plant material harvested. Response surface methodology has previously been used to optimise extraction procedures for secondary metabolites from several plants (Costa and Faria, 1998; Del Valle et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2000; Moldão-Martins et al., 2000; Jones et al., 2001). EXPERIMENTAL Materials. Leaves of C. Sylvestris were collected from different locations in the State of São Paulo, including Gaggs Farm in Presidente Venceslau, the State Park Carlos Botelho in São Miguel Arcanjo, the Ecological State Park Juréia-Itatins/Núcleo Arpoador in Peruíbe Beach, and the Campus of São Paulo State University in Araraquara. The authenticities of the collected specimens were veriﬁed by Dr. Inês Cordeiro (IB-SMA/ SP, Brazil).

The maceration and sonication extraction techniques were performed using a 3 × 3 × 3 full factorial design including three acidity conditions, three solvents of different polarities and three extraction times. The yields and selectivities of the extrac- tion of casearins were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by acidity conditions. Taking into account all variables tested, the optimal conditions for maceration extraction were estimated to involve treatment with dichloromethane saturated with ammonium hydroxide for 26 h. Similar yields and selectivities for casearins were determined for sonication extraction using the same solvent but for the much shorter time of 1 h. The best results for stabilisation of the fresh plant material were obtained using leaves that had been oven dried at 40°C for 48 h. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

EXTRACTION OF CASEARINS FROM CASEARIA SYLVESTRIS 169 Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Phytochem. Anal. 17: 168–175 (2006) DOI: 10.1002.pca dried at 40°C for 24 h, ﬁnely ground and stored at 25°C until required for experiments designed to determine the optimal conditions for the extraction of the collected materials. The experimental stabilisation procedures were performed with leaves collected in the University Campus in Araraquara. The fresh leaves were  immediately  submitted  to  the  different stabilisation procedures. All solvents used in the experimental procedures had been glass distilled. For chromatographic analyses, HPLC-grade solvents (J. T. Baker, Xalostoc, Mexico) were employed. Water was puriﬁed immediately prior to use with a Milli Q plus system (Millipore, Milford, MA, USA). Experimental design and statistical analysis. Experi- ments were conducted in order to evaluate a range of extraction times (12, 24 and 36 h for maceration and 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 h for sonication), and solvent polarities (hexane, dichloromethane, methanol and water) at three  acidity  conditions  (pure  solvent,  solvent saturated with formic acid and solvent saturated with ammonium hydroxide), in a 3 × 3 × 3 full factorial design. The values of the variables of the study were coded in order to assist with the construction of the experimental design, to remove factorial units, to adjust variable axes to intermediate values, and to deﬁne a new scale (Table 1). These coded values enabled  facile  computational  manipulation,  and increased  accuracy  in  all  estimated  coefﬁcients (Taqueda et al., 1998). The quadratic response surfaces were  estimated  by  least-square  regression.  The predicted optimal values for the independent variables were determined from the estimated surface at the maximum stationary point. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the statistical signiﬁcance of the ﬁtted surface. Additionally, the best extraction  condition  was  tested  experimentally, and estimated and experimental values were com- pared in order to evaluate the accuracy of the response surface. Extraction protocol and sample clean-up. Dried and ground leaves of C. sylvestris (0.400 g) were extracted by maceration or sonication with 6.0 mL of solvent in a centrifuge tube. Samples were centrifuged in a CELM (Barueri-SP, Brazil) instrument at 1200 g for 10 min. An aliquot (1.5 mL) of the supernatant was evaporated to dryness and weighed in order to determine the yield of crude extract. This extract was then dissolved in 1.0 mL of methanol:water (98:2, v/v) and submitted to further clean-up by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Laboratory-prepared SPE-C18 columns (20 × 9 mm i.d.), dry packed with 1.5 g of LiChroprep® RP18 (40– 63 µm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), were activated with methanol and conditioned with methanol:water (98:2, v/v). Following application of samples, columns were eluted with 5 mL of methanol:water (98:2, v/v), and the eluates ﬁltered through PTFE membranes (0.45 µm; Millipore) prior to HPLC analysis. All samples were prepared in duplicate. HPLC analysis. A Varian (Palo Alto, CA, USA) ProStar liquid chromatograph coupled to a photodiode array detector (PAD) and a ProStar 410 autosampler was used. Instrumental control and data processing were accomplished using a Varian Star chromatography Figure 1 Casearins A-T and casearvestrins A-C previously isolated from Casearia sylvestris. 170 K. F.

An aliquot (20 µL) of sample solution was  injected  onto  a  Supelcosil®  C18  (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm), which was eluted with a mixture of acetonitrile (solvent A) and water (solvent B), initially at 48:52 (A:B), changing by linear gradient to 75:25 over 30 min, and then by linear gradient to 100% A over 20 min, and ﬁnally isocratically with 100% A for 3 min. The solvent ﬂow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Detection was at 235 nm for all samples; peaks of casearins were identiﬁed by analysis of UV spectra, obtained from the PAD detector, with λmax at 235 nm (Fig. 2). In order to provide a relative comparison among the different samples, the sum of the areas of the casearin peaks (in arbitrary units) was considered representa- tive of casearin content. The predominance of casearins in these samples was conﬁrmed from 1H- NMR spectra (measured on a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer) of leaf extracts, which showed prominent signals at δ 5.2 (d, H12), δ 5.6 (dd, H14), δ 5.1– 5.2 (d, H15a and H15b), δ 5.5– 6.4 (H18) and δ 6.5 (s, H19) that are characteristic of casearin-type clerodane diterpenes. The ratio of casearin content to the yield of crude extract obtained was employed as an indicator of extraction selectivity. Stabilisation procedures. The contents of casearins in samples obtained from leaves of a specimen of C. Sylvestris collected at the University Campus in Araraquara were evaluated as a function of the sample preparation procedure. The leaves were collected and immediately submitted to eight different conditions: freezing with liquid nitrogen followed by either oven drying (40°C for 48 h) or lyophilisation, freezing with dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) followed by either oven drying or lyophilisation, freezing with ice followed by either oven drying or lyophilisation, and direct oven drying or air drying at ambient temperature in the shade. In each experimental procedure, 0.400 g of leaves were extracted by sonication with 6.0 mL of dichloromethane saturated with ammonium hydroxide as solvent, followed by centrifugation (1200 g, 10 min). The sample clean-up and HPLC analyses were as described. Statistical signiﬁcances between mean values were evaluated using Student’s t-test at the 95% level. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Effect of extraction parameters Typical HPLC chromatograms of the extracts of the leaves of C. sylvestris obtained by maceration and sonication extraction are presented in Fig. 2. The inﬂu- ence of extraction time, solvent polarity and acidity conditions on the extraction of casearins from the leaves of C. sylvestris were evaluated through the construction of response surfaces. Such surfaces were ﬁtted separately to each acidity condition. Most of the response variables had maximum stationary points and their critical values were within the experimental range (Figs 3 and 4). The yield and selectivity of the ex- traction of casearins were greatly inﬂuenced by acidity conditions, being reduced under acidic conditions and increased under basic conditions in both the macera- tion and sonication methods. These results could be indicative of the presence of acid and/or phenolic compounds besides the casearins, which were not extracted by solvents with low polarity such as dichloromethane in alkaline conditions. Casearin extraction by maceration The maximum point for yield of crude extract was out- side the response surface obtained (Fig. 3), but the response surface of casearin content and extraction selectivity both showed maximum points within the experimental range.

Anal. 17: 168–175 (2006) DOI: 10.1002.pca casearins after just 1 h of sonication would be similar to those available after 26 h of maceration (Table 2). Veriﬁcation of the quadratic response surface model The response surfaces for casearin content and extrac- tion selectivity were statistically signiﬁcant according to the F test at the 95% level (Table 3). In order to verify the accuracy of the response surface model, the opti- mum condition estimated for extraction by sonication was tested. All measured values of the response vari- ables were within the 99% conﬁdence range of pre- dicted values based on quadratic response surface model (Table 4). the extraction of casearins from leaves of C. sylvestris by maceration given by the maximum stationary point (i.e. where the partial derivative of the response surface regression equation is equal to zero) involved 26 h extraction  with  dichloromethane  saturated  with ammonium hydroxide (Table 2). Casearin extraction by sonication As with maceration, dichloromethane saturated with ammonium hydroxide was determined to be the best solvent for the extraction of casearins from leaves of C. sylvestris by sonication (Fig. 4). However, it was predicted that the extraction yield and selectivity of Figure 2 Typical HPLC chromatograms of extracts from leaves of C. sylvestris obtained by (A) maceration, and (B) sonication extraction.

EXTRACTION OF CASEARINS FROM CASEARIA SYLVESTRIS 173 Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Phytochem. Anal. 17: 168–175 (2006) DOI: 10.1002.pca Sample stabilization The yield of crude extract, the casearin content and the extraction selectivity obtained from sonication extrac- tion of leaves of C. sylvestris that had received eight different sample stabilisation procedures are shown (Fig. 5). The extractions were performed under the opti- mal conditions selected from the response surfaces. The highest yield of crude extract was obtained by extraction of leaves that had been frozen with solid carbon dioxide followed by lyophilisation, whilst the highest casearin content and selectivity were obtained by extraction of leaves that had been dried directly in an oven at 40°C. These results reveal that special treat- ments are needed in order to stabilise plant material to obtain maximum yield of casearins from the leaves. This ﬁnding is reinforced by consideration of the casearin content obtained from leaf samples air-dried in the shade, which was around 15% lower than that obtained from oven-dried materials. The response surface methodology was effective in optimising conditions for the extraction of casearins from the leaves of C. sylvestris, and there was a good correlation between the variables tested and the yield of secondary compound obtained. The casearin content and selectivity were dependent on, and greatly inﬂuenced by, polarity and acidity of solvents with the best results obtained following extraction with dichloromethane under alkaline conditions. The ex- tracts obtained by sonication or by maceration under these conditions showed the same chromatographic proﬁles (Fig. 2), which was indicative of the stability of casearins during the extraction protocol. Sonication ex- traction showed the advantage of a very much reduced extraction time compared with maceration extraction.
