THE CHEMISTRY OF BRAZILIAN LEGUMINOSAE. LXI. (+)-METHYL VOUACAPENATE FROM  VOUACAPOUA  PALLID IOR.  Silvia M.C. Dias (*)  J. Guilherme S. Maia (**)  Zenaide S. Ferreira  (***)  Otto R. Gottlieb  (***)  SUMMARY  The wood o{j Vouacapoua ραΙΙίχϋοΛ. [lQ..Qimlnoòan-Ca2J><xíplnÁ.oidnaí)  contaA.no  ( + )-meXhul  vouacapznate..  The genus Vouacapoua Aubl. (family Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae) comprises three  arboreous species found in tropical South America where they are popularly known under  the collective designation "acapu". Their wood is of great durability and has been ex­ ploited in Construction, mostly of flooring and furniture, for so many years that  the  trees are nearing extinction (Rizzini ε Mors, 1976).  V. americana Aubl. and V. macropetala Sandw. have been examined previously  with  respect to thei r chemica 1 const i tuents. Wood samples of both species were found to contaiη  (+)-methyl vouacapenate (Sploelstra, 1930; King et al., 1955).  In continuation of our  work on the chemistry of Leguminosae (for Part LX see Dias et al., 1982), we wish to re  port that the trunk wood of V.pallidior Ducke also contains a substantial quantity  of  the same compound. Methyl vouacapenate is also accesscible through total  synthesis  (Spencer et al., 1 9 7 1 ) .  EXPERIMENTAL  Trunk wood of V.pallidior (voucher INPA herbarium 58-612) was collected at  the  (A)  Instituto Biológico, Secretaria de Agricultura e Abastecimento do Estado de  São  Paulo, 04014 - São Paulo, SP  (**)  Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia - INPA/CNPq - Caixa Postal 478 -69000  Manaus, AM  (***) Instituto de Química, Universidade de São Paulo - 05508- São Paulo, SP  ftCTA AMAZÔNICA 1^(3- 2*) : ^ 5 1 - ^ 5 3 -  1984.  451  Forest Reserve A.

The solution was evaporated and the residue (18 g) was washed sue  cessively with light petrol, benzene and chloroform.  The petrol solution, upon concen­ tration and cooling, gave a precipitate (2g) which was filtered  and crystallized  from  methanol to (+)-methyl vouacapenate, mp 103-104°, ja| D + 120° (c 1.5, C C1^) ; lit.

The benzene solution was  evaporated and the residue (0.9 g) was chromatographed on a silica (10 g) column. Elu- tion with benzene gave fatty material; and elution with benzene - chloroform 1.1  and  chloroform gave fatty material plus sitosterol. All fractions contained small propor - tions of methyl vouacapenate. The chloroform solution was evaporated and the  residue  (0.8 g) was chromatographed on a silica (10 g) column.  Elution with benzene gave again  fatty material, sitosterol plus a trace of methyl vouacapenate; and elution with  ben­ zene-ethyl acetate 1:1 and 3:7 gave additionally another compound. The latter two frac  tions were united and evaporated.  The residue was crystallized from chloroform to the  KR r*  1  compound (1.5 m g ) , mp 187-193°.

The minute amount and low stabili­ ty of the compound obtained precluded further examination.
