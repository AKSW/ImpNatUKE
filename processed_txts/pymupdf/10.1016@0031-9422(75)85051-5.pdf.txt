Abstract-The  wood of the vine Derris  rar&m  (Leguminosae-Lotoideae)  contains  3.5dimethoxy-4-prenylstil-  bene, (2S)-5,7-dihydroxy-6-prenylflavanone  and (2S)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-6-prenylflavanone.  Den-is  rarifbra  (Mart.) Macbr.  (Leguminosae-  Lotoideae),  trivial name “timb6-rana”,  can be  found in vast regions of the Amazon valley, from  the Guianas, the brazilian States of Para and Ama-  zonas to Peru [2].

Fractiona-  tion of the ethanolic wood extract led to 3 novel  compounds, the stilbene (1) and the flavanones (2a)  and (2b). The structure of the stilbene derivative,  C, ,HZ40Z,, was deduced from its PMR and MS.  Oxidation led to benzoic acid, confirming the pres-  ence of the phenyl group. The additional aromatic  ring must be symmetrically substituted since its 2  aromatic and 6 methoxyl protons give rise to PMR  singlets. Double  resonance  experiments  estab-  lished the lack of coupling between the aromatic  and the benzylic methylene protons, eliminating  one of the two symmetrical alternatives in’favour  of la.  The structures of the (2S)-flavanones, CzoHZo04  (2a) and C2 ,HZZ04 (2b), were deduced from ORD,  (1)  fJH,,,,,,O  (20)  R’=CH,CH=CMe,.

Although  treatment  with acid produced  etherification  of the  C-5 hydroxyl  by the side chain. as shown by the IR  carbonyl  frequency  shift (IJ,,,~,~ 1642- 1670 cm- ’ ).  this test was not considered  conclusive  proof for  the orrho-position  of OH and prenyl groups.  In the  tlavanone  series  acid  catalyzed  rearrangcmcnt  could  invalidate  its significance.  Pyridine-induced  solvent  shifts have been advocated  to determine  the location  of hydrogen  or alkyl  substituents  in  the vicinity  of phenolic  hydroxyls  [3]. The quanta-  tive conclusions  of this work  are, however.  not  applicable  to cases in which the hydroxyl  can che-  late with an adjacent  carbonyl.  Thus  the pyridine  shifts for the flavanones  (3) and (4). whose prepara-  tion [4],  separation  and  identification  [S]  have  been  achieved.  are  very  close.  respectively  -  027 ppm  (H-6) and  -0.22  ppm  (H-X)., Absolute  resonance  values  in pyridine.  however,  arc more  significant.  While in CDCl,  the H-6 and H-8 sig-  nals arc very close (2, z 4.04. 4, 7 4.00) in pyridine  the H-6 signal appears  at lower field (T 3.73) than  the H-8 signal (T 3.82). Thus in the pyridine  spec-  trum of 7Gmethylpinocembrin  (2~). the 3.73 sig-  nal must bc attributed  to H-6 and the 3.78 signal  to H-X. The pyridine  spectrum  of the isolate shows  ofcourse  only one of these signals. Since this occurs  at z 3.77, it can be correlated  only with H-8. The  strong pyridine  solvent  shift (A -0.21  ppm) of the  prenylmethylene  resonance  is also consistent  with  the orrho-relationship  of the 5-hydroxyl  and alkql  groups  in ring A of 2b. and, consequently.  also 2a.
