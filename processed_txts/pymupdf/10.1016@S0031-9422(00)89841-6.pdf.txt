Abstract-Fourteen Brosimum species (Moraceae)  contain  either pyranocoumarins  or furocoumarins,  besides 0-prenylbrosiparin  which gives rise to brosiprenin  by a Claisen type rearrangement.  Two BRAZILIAN Brosimum species have so far been examined phytochemically : B. gaudi-  chaudii Trtcul  whose roots were reported to contain psoralen (Ia)” and bergapten (Ib),2*3  and B. rubescens Taubert whose trunk wood contains xanthyletin (IIa), luvangetin (IIb),  7-demethylsuberosin  (IIIa), brosiparin (IIIb) and brosiprenin (IIIc).~ It was considered  thatrthe biosynthesis of 111~ might involve a Claisen type rearrangement,  in spite of the  fact that O-prenylbrosiparin  (IIId) had not been detected in the extract of B. rubescers4  The hypothesis, however, seemed so attractive that a search for the putative precursor IIId  was undertaken in wood samples of 13 Amazonian Brosimum species. As far as TLC com-  parisons of extracts obtained from preserved voucher specimens merit confidence, the  analysis of the results (Table 1) leads to the following comments.

Prenyl-  coumarins are, of course, precursors to both types of compounds, as indicated by the con-  stant quantitative ratio of xanthyletin (IIa) and 7-demethylsuberosin (IIIa) in most extracts,  as well as the co-occurrence of luvangetin (IIb) and brosiparin (IIIb). O-Prenylbrosiparin  (IIId) was detected in the particular species of the pyranocoumarin  section which contains  * Part IV in the series “Plant Chemosystematics  and Phylogeny”.

The biosynthetic  association  of IIIb and 111~ with O-prenylbrosiparin  is thus a reasonable  postulate.  Indeed, both in nature and in the laboratory  through  pyrolysis  of O-prenylbrosiparin  (IIIdJ4  brosiparin  (IIIb)  and brosiprenin  (111~) are formed  in sub-  stantially  equal amounts.  TABLE 1.
