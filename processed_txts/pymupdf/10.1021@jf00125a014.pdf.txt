Zoghbi, Lamar Scott Ramos, Jose Guilherme S. Maia,* Miriam L. da Silva,  and Arnaldo Iran R. Luz  The essential oil from Adenocalymma alliaceum leaves (ca.  0.04%) was investigated with GC and GC-MS.  Of the 13 compounds tentatively identified, 9 are likely to be part of a homologous series. The most  abundant components were diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide, which comprise 62% of the oil.  The garlic bush (Portuguese, cip6 d’alho) is a widespread  plant in Brazil, particularly in the north where the prin-  cipal species is Adenocalymma alliaceum Miers. Upon  the sample handling of the large leaves, a strong odor  exudes, similar to that of garlic (Allium satiuum). Al-  though infusions of the leaves are used in treating colds  and fevers (Pi0 Correa, 1931; Figueiredo, 1979), its prin-  cipal use is in the substitution of garlic, especially in the  interior regions of difficult access.  The ethereal extracts of steam distillates from fresh  leaves of the garlic bush were first studied by Apparao et  al. (1978), using packed column gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry (GC-MS). The principal components of the  extracts to be the diallyl di-, tri-, and tetrasulfides.  Not surprisingly, these are also among the major con-  stituents in garlic (Oaks et al., 1964; Brodnitz et al., 1971).  As part of an ongoing study of the essential oil of amazo-  nian plants, we have characterized the volatile5 of garlic  bush, using capillary column gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry, and we now report the presence of additional  alkenyl sulfides.  EXPERIMENTAL SECTION  Plant material of A. alliaceum was collected in Aurl,  near Belem, state of Parii, and an exsiccate (no. 69 734) has  been placed in the herbarium at the Emilio Goeldi Mu-  seum, in BelBm. The air-dried leaves were subjected to  steam distillation, and the volatile oil obtained was dried  in the presence of sodium sulfate. The yield was 0.04%.  The volatile oil was analyzed with a Carlo Erba 4160 gas  chromatography (FID), with a 30 m X 0.25 mm fused silica  capillary column containing a 0.25 pm film of SE-54.  Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas, adjusted to a linear  velocity of 33 cm/s (measured at 150 “C); the split flow  was adjusted to give a 20:l ratio, and the septum sweep  was a constant 10 cm3/min. Splitless injection of 2 pL,  on a 1:lOOO n-hexane solution, was followed by a delay of  30 s before beginning the purge. Injection was done with  the oven at 50 OC. After a 3-min initial wait, the tem-  perature was programmed at 6 OC/min to 230 OC.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed  on a Finnigan 4021 GC-MS system, which includes on  Incos data system. An identical 30-m SE-54 silica capillary  column was installed in the GC, in a Grob-type injector,  and directly coupled to the ion source of the MS. Helium  was used as carrier gas, and injection and oven-program-  ming temperatures were the same as above except a 4  OC/min gradient was used. The mass spectrometer was  in E1 mode at 70 eV. The quadrupole filter was scanned  from 34 to 434 daltons once every second, and resulting  spectra were stored on computer discs for later recall.  Identifications were based on mass spectra by compar-  ison with those in the data system library and confirmed  by retention data (Kovats, 1958).  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  A gas chromatogram of the essential oil of the garlic bush  is presented in Figure 1. From this GC trace one can see  the simplicity of the mixture and the prominence of two  components, peaks 6 and 13. These were tentatively  confirmed to be the diallyl di- and trisulfides, as reported  by Apparao et al. (1978). Diallyl tetrasulfide (peak 15) was  also found to be present, although not as abundant as  reported. For each of these sulfides, the MS matched  almost perfectly with that given by Apparao et al. (1978).  Several other major peaks were present, most of which  @ 1984 American Chemical Society  1010 J. Agric. Food Chem., Vol. 32, No. 5, 1984  Zoghbi et al.  ‘ I   I ’   LI  ‘1  Figure 1. Gas chromatogram of the essential oil of the garlic bush.  produced fairly unambiguous mass spectra. For example,  peaks 5 and 12 each had molecular weights 2 units higher  than their neighboring peaks, the didyl di- and trisulfides,  respectively. On the basis of their MS fragmentation, these  were determined to be either allyl propyl or propenyl  propyl di- and trisulfides. From a discussion of the relative  stabilities of the 1-propenylthio and allylthio cations  (Nishimura et al., 1971), it was apparent that the two  compounds were, in fact, allyl propyl sulfides. Similarly,  peak 7 presented a mass spectrum that appeared to be a  allyl methyl trisulfide.  The components tentatively  identified are listed in Table I.  All of the sulfides mentioned above with the exception  of diallyl tetrasulfide have been determined in garlic and  onion (Oaks et al., 1964; Brodnitz et al.8 1971; Boelens et  al., 1971). Oaks et al. (1964) showed by means of a log plot  of the relative retention time (RRT) vs. the number of  sulfur atoms that each additional sulfur atom is additive  in its effect on the retention time. By using a similar  strategy, making a normal plot (instead of log, because we  used temperature programming) of RRT and the number  of sulfur atoms (Figure 2), we were able to locate minor  peaks in the chromatogram likely to be part of a homol-  ogous series. Thus, peak 1 was identified as the diallyl  sulfide and peaks 2 and 14 were identified as allyl methyl  di- and tetrasulfides.  Peaks 4 and 8-10 did not produce mass spectra that  were easily interpreted. Bodnitz et al. (1971), in analyzing  garlic extracts, found the principal components to be the  vinyldithienes (peaks 8 and 10) shown in Table I. Di-  thiacyclopentene (peak 4) was detected in the flavor of  cooked asparagus (Tressl et al., 1977), and the mass  spectrum given compares very well with that for our peak.  Peak 9 is the only peak for which we had no confirmatory  mass spectrum. By calculation of isotope ratios, its mo-  lecular formula, based on the apparent molecular ion at  136 daltons, appeared to be C3H4S3. We propose this  compound is trithiacyclohexane, based on the MS frag-  mentation and the presence of dithiacyclopentene, but this  has not yet been confirmed.  The somewhat unpleasant, although characteristic,  aromas of all the plants mentioned are due in large part  to the presence of a combination of these alkenyl sulfides  and the thiosulfonates, coproducts formed from the  0-Diallyl  A-Allyl propyl  0 - A l l y l  methyl  0  I  I  I  I  1  2  3  4  Number of Sulfur Atoms  Figure 2.

Although the leaves of the  garlic bush quickly produce the pungent, garlicky odor  upon handling, the aroma disappears after several days of  drying. As shown by Boelens et al. (1971), the quality (i.e.,  the mixture of alkenyl sulfides) of cut onion is considerably  modified over time. Further studies must be done to de-  termine the viability of the garlic bush as a large-scale  substitute of garlic, in particular, with respect to harvesting  and storage.
