Abstract--From the stem of Cedrela odorata grafted on Toona cil&ta var. austral& were isolated calamenene,  cycloeucalenol, sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, gedunin, 7-deacetylgedunin, 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin,  methylangolensate, febrifugin, azadiradione, 20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone, 3fl-deacetylfissinolide  and, catechin, together with the new limonoid 1 a-methoxy-1,2-dihydrogedunin and the new cycloartane 3fl-O-  fl-D-glucopyranosylcycloeucalenol. The limonoids were of little value to clarify the basis of the induced  resistance in the graft against Hypsipyla grandella. The cycloartanes and catechin could have been translocated  from Toona stock to the Cedrela graft. Copyright © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd  INTRODUCTION  Efforts to establish large-scale homogeneous plan-  tations of native Meliaceae have almost invariably  failed due to larval attacks by the shoot borer Hyp-  sipyla (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The host range of this  oligophagous pantropical genus is limited principally  to the Swietenioideae. Of this subfamily, important  species of the genera Khaya and Entandrophragma in  Africa, Swietenia and Cedrela in Latin America and  Toona in Asia and Australia are attacked. However,  Toona ciliata introduced to Brazil shows excellent  growth and an absence of attacks by H. grandella, in  contrast to the native Cedrela odorata. The latter has  been grafted to stems of T. ciliata and the resistance  has been translocated from the Toona stock to the  Cedrela graft [1]. The natural products of these grafts  have not been previously studied. Thus, we have now  examined the stem of C. odorata grafted on T. ciliata  var. australis, in order to determine if secondary  metabolites present in the latter could be translocated  into the former.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  A dichloromethane-soluble fraction of the meth-  anol extract of the stem of C. odorata graft afforded  *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.  the sesquiterpene calamenene [2], the cycloartane  cycloeucalenol (1) [3], the sterols sitosterol, stigma-  sterol and campesterol, the limonoids gedunin (2)  [4, 5], 7-deacetylgedunin (3) [6], 7-deacetoxy-7-oxoge-  dunin (4) [6], methylangolensate (5) [6], febrifugin (6)  [6] and azadiradione (7) [7], the apotirucallane  20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone (8) [8], as  well as the new limonoid 9.  Compound 9 exhibited similar spectral data to 2 [4,  5]. The ~ H NM R spectrum (Table 1), instead of signals  for a ring-A 1-en-3-one, showed a signal for one meth-  oxyl singlet (6 3.31) and ~H resonances for an ABX  system associated with 2H-2 (6 2.86, J = 16.4, 4.0 and  2.65 Hz; J = 16.4 and 3.0 Hz) and H-l (6 3.34, br t,  J = 3.2 Hz). The smaller coupling constant indicated  that the methoxyl group was attached a to C-1. This  was also supported by NOESY experiments, which  showed correlations of the methoxyl signal with the  signals of H-2~ (6 2.65) and H-9 (6 3.09) and of the  signal of H-1 with the signal of H3-19 (6 1.12). In  addition, the signal of H-7 (6 4.50) showed cross peaks  with the signals of H-6fl (6 1.79), H-6a (6 1.88), H-15  (6 3.51) and H3-30 (6 1.12); this implies that the acetate  is attached a to C-7, as in 2.  The identification of the ring A as a 1-methoxy-3-  one was also supported by comparison of the IH and  J3C NMR spectra (Tables 1 and 2) with those of l~-  methoxy-l,2-dihydroepoxyazadiradione  (10)  [9].  1449  1450  J.

Coupling constants (Hz) in parentheses.  *Data obtained in this study suggest that these resonances were previously incorrectly assigned.  Moreover, the chemical shifts of the ring B-E carbons  were comparable with those reported for 2 (Table 2)  [4, 5]. The new natural product was therefore ident-  ified as 1 ct-methoxy- 1,2-dihydrogedunin.  In order to confirm that 9 is a genuine natural  product and was not derived from addition of meth-  anol to the 1-en-3-one system, a solution of 2 in meth-  anol with a small amount of silica gel added was  stirred for three weeks at room temperature. After  removal of solvent, the ~H NMR  spectrum of the  recovered  material  indicated  that  no  reaction  occurred. This observation, together with the fact that  the stem examined did not give the two possible epi-  mers at C-l, provided conclusive evidence that 9 is  naturally occurring.  The IH-IH COSY, TOCSY, HMQC and HMBC  on 20,21,22,23-tetrahydro-23-oxoazadirone (8) per-  mitted minor corrections to previous IH and 13C NMR  assignments [8]. The signals for H-5 and H-22 (Table  1) and C-4, C-9, C-10, C-16 and C-22 (Table 2) were  reassigned.  An ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the methanol  extract of the stem of C. odorata graft afforded the  limonoids 2, 3fl-deacetylfissinolide (11) [10], the fla-  vonoid catechin [11] and the new cycloartane 12.

Acetylation of 12 with acetic  anhydride in pyridine gave a tetra-acetate (12a). The  1H and 13C NMR spectra of 12a and cycloeucalenol  (1) [3] were very similar. The presence of a 2,3,4,6-  tetra-O-acetyl-fl-glucopyranose linked at C-3fl was  indicated by the proton signal at 6 3.12 (dt, J = 10.5  and 4.8 Hz, H-3ct) and the 13C signal at 6 88.0 (Table  2). The configuration of the anomeric position of the  glucose moiety was assigned to be fl from the coupling  constant of the anomeric proton (6 4.58 d, J = 8.0  Hz). The nature of the sugar was confirmed by a  comparative analysis of the 13C NMR data for 12a  with those of quinovic acid 3fl-O-~-D-glucopyranoside  peracetyl dimethyl ester (13, a dimethyl urs-12-en-  14, ! 7-dioate) [ 12]. Thus, compound 12 was concluded  to be 3fl-O-fl-D-glucopyranosylcycloeucalenol.  As reported previously [13], limonoid biosynthesis  in Cedrela proceeds along only one route, which leads  1452  J.R.

Thus, C. odorata  graft produces a considerable number of limonoids  which are common in Cedrela, but 3, 7, 11 and the  apotirucallane 8 were not previously found from the  latter. Compounds 7 and 8 are typical of the Toona  [13], but they might be the biosynthetic intermediates  to Cedrela limonoids.  Studies of the structure/anti-insect activity relation-  ships for several limonoids have established that aside  from the C-seco-limonoids, the most active com-  pounds appear to be intact apo-euphol limonoids with  a 14,15-epoxide and a 3-oxo-l-ene A ring. Absence of  the 14, 15fl-epoxide results in reduced activity, as with  7 [14]. Thus, the finding of both limonoids 7 and 8 is  of little value to clarify the basis of induced resistance  in the graft.  Stigmasterol and campesterol do not appear to have  been recorded previously from C: odorata and T. cili-  ata. However, they are of widespread distribution and  thus possibly of little chemotaxanomic interest. Rep-  resentatives of the cadinene series of sesquiterpenes  have been reported from the stems of C. odorata and  T. ciliata [2, 15], but calamenene is known only from  the former. Flavonols and 3-glycoside derivatives  were found in leaves ofC. sinensis [16], but not so far in  Components of Cedrela odorata  1453  any other Cedrela. Proanthocyanidins have otherwise  been reported from only a single Toona species (stem  of T. ciliata) [17].  The genus Cedrela has been widely investigated,  but, to date, there are no records of cycloartanes. Our  own investigations of the stem and leaves of T. ciliata  revealed the presence of cycloeucalenol (1) and 12  (unpublished results). Since the latter types and pro-  anthocyanidins have not been found in C. odorata,  the occurrence of both cycloartanes (1 and 12) and  catechin (in great amounts) in the graft suggests that  these constituents could have been translocated from  the Toona stock to the Cedrela graft. However, both  species should be re-examined for condensed tannins  and their precursors (as catechin), and C. odorata for  cycloartanes.

Isolation of compounds. Ground stems (3 kg, 5-year-  old tree and stems worked with a diameter of 30 cm)  were extracted with hexane, then CH2C12 and finally  with MeOH. The concd MeOH extract was par-  titioned into CH2C12, EtOAc and n-BuOH soluble frs.  The concd CH2C12-soluble fr. was subjected to CC  over silica gel. Elution with a CHzCI2-MeOH gradient  afforded 20 frs. Fr. 1 was purified by prep. TLC (silica  gel; hexane) to yield calamenene (9 mg). Frs 3-5 were  flash chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hex-  ane-EtOAc-MeOH (94: 5: 1) affording 2 (490 mg) and  20 new frs. Frs 3/15-16 were recrystallized in MeOH  yielding 1 (19 mg). Frs 7-8 were flash chro-  matographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-  EtOAc-MeOH (69:30:1) affording 10 new frs. Frs  7/2-4 yielded, after crystallization in MeOH, an  amorphous solid characterized by low resolution GC-  MS as a mixt. (78 mg) of sitosterol, campesterol and  stigmasterol. Frs 7/5-6 were flash chromatographed  on silica gel, eluting with CH2CI2-MeOH (49:1)  affording 2 (240 mg). Fr. 7/7 was rechromatographed  as above to afford 2 (260 mg) and 3 (82 mg). Frs 7/9-  10 were recrystallized in MeOH yielding 4 (78 mg)  and fr. 9/1, which was rechromatographed as above,  to afford new frs (9/la and 9/lb). Fr. 9/la (20 rag)  was submitted to R-HPLC (detection UV 2 215 nm)  affording, 5 (3 mg), after recycling x 2, 2 (lst peak, 3  mg) and 9 (2nd peak, 7 mg), after recycling × 3. Fr.  9/lb (20 mg) was submitted to R-HPLC (detection  UV 2 240 nm) affording 8 (2 rag), after recycling x 3,  7 (6 mg), after recycling × 4, and 6 (8 rag), after  recycling x 5.  The concd EtOAc-soluble fr. of the MeOH extract  was subjected to CC over silica gel. Elution with a  CH2C12-MeOH gradient afforded 20 frs. Frs 1-2 were  submitted to CC over silica gel eluting with CH2C12-  MeOH (99: 1) affording 2 (750 rag) and 15 new frs.  Frs 1/12-13 were twice flash chromatographed on sil-  ica gel (CH2CI2-Me2CO, 24:1; hexane-EtOAc-  MeOH, 50:50: 1) yielding 11 (13 mg). Fr. 7 was recrys-  tallized in MeOH yielding 12 (37 mg). Fr. 11 was flash  chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with hexane-  CH2C12-MeOH (3:5:2) affording 12 (3 rag) and cate-  chin (460 mg). Compound 12 was allowed to react  overnight with an excess of Ac20 in pyridine.
