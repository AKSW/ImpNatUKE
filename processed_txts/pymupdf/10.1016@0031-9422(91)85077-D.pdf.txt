Abstract-A  hydroalcoholic  extract  of the leaves of Alibertia  macrophylla afforded  the esters of caffeic acid and  2-phenylethanol  or 2-methyl butane-1,4-diol.  The leaves also contain cafleic acid. The acetone extract of the stems of  A. macrophyllu contain a-amyrin, /?-amyrin, a-amyrenone,  /I-amyrenone, lupeol, lupenone and germanicone. Struc-  tural assignments were taken through spectral data analysis and physical properties. This is the first report on the  chemistry of Alibertia.  INTRODUCTION  The economic  and therapeutic  importance  of many  species of Rubiaceae is well known in Brazil, where this  family includes representatives  belonging to 125 genera  [ 11. The region of Sgo Paulo has ca 204 registered species;  they are herbs, shrubs or trees growing in the forest and  ‘cerrado’ [l J. Alibertia mucrophylla K. Schum was of  interest for phytochemical  studies as the presence of  fungitoxic constituents in a polar extract of its leaves has  been shown [2, 33, also, no previous studies of Alibertia  have been undertaken. We report the isolation of caffeic  acid and two of its esters from the leaves of A. macro-  phylla. We have also examined the stems of this species:  a-amyrin, /?-amyrin, a-amirenone,  /I-amirenone,  lupeol,  lupenone and germanicone  were isolated and identified.  The structural  assignments  for the two new natural  derivatives of caffeic acid are presented and discussed.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The hydroalcoholic extract prepared from the leaves of  A. macrophylla showed, when submitted  to TLC and  bioassay with Cladosporium sphaerospermum, the pres-  ence of three zones of inhibition at R, 0.22,0.36 and 0.65  [43. By a combination  of partition into solvent systems  and chromatographic  methods la-c were isolated from a  40% ethanol extract. The spectral properties of lb and c  showed these substances  as esters of caffeic acid. A  molecular  ion peak at m/z 284 was found for lb  (CI,H,604)  and at m/z 266 for lc (C14H,s05).  The  molecular  formulae  were  also  supported  by  the  “CNMR  data (Table 1). The IR spectra of both com-  pounds showed the presence of a&unsaturated  ester  carbonyl (1695, 1630cn-‘),  aromatic rings (1610 and  1520 cm - ’ and of hydroxyl groups (335&3340 cm - ‘).  The ‘H NMR spectra of la and lb indicated aromatic  protons as an ABX system  (Table 2) and a pattern  similar to that of caffeic acid is suggested. It is significant  that the values summarized  in Table 2 are in good  agreement with those published for calTeic acid and its  derivatives [S-8]. The main differences between lb and c  seem to be related to the alcoholic portion of the esters  and were clearly shown by ‘H and 13CNMR data. For  lb, the presence of a second aromatic  ring bearing a two  carbon lateral chain was suggested:  the ‘H NMR spectra  showed a broad singlet (SH) at 67.24 and two triplets at  62.64 (J = 7.5 Hz) and 3.68 (J = 7.5 Hz) which can respect-  ively be assigned to the benzilic and to the carbinolic  protons of a 2-phenylethoxy  unit. For le. the following  features were deduced from ‘H NMR: the signals at 64.00  and 3.86 were assigned to four carbinolic protons and the  doublet at 1.01 should correspond to the protons of a  Table 1. “YINMR spectral data for compounds la-z at  50.0 MHz’  C  In  lb  IC  1  2  3  4  5  6  I  8  9  1’  2  3’  4  5  6  7  8  127.00 s  114.90 d  149.55 s  146.72 s  115.15d  122.34 d  146.68 d  116.35 d  167.42 s  127.76 s  114.36 d  148.81 s  145.85 s  115.36 d  122.31 d  148.35 d  116.00d  168.21 s  126.56 s  128.71 d  129.83 d  139.00 d  129.83 d  128.71 d  34.32 I  60.82 t  127.20 s  115.35 d  148.81 s  145.01 s  114SOd  122.90 d  148.50 d  116.00 d  168.30 5  68.02 r  37.90 d  39.89 r  60.90 t  19.02 q  -  *Measured in acetone-d,.

Their identifications  were based on the  comparison  of physical  and  spectral  data,  mainly  t3CNMR  6 values, with the values reported  in the  literature for a-amyrin, r-amyrenone,  /3-amyrin, /I?-amyr-  enone,  germanicone,  lupeol  and  htpenone  [l&13]  respectively.  EXPERIMENTAL  Plant material. Alibertia macrophylla was collected in the  Estafio Ecologica e Experimental de Magi-Guacu (SP), by Dr  M. C. M. Young and identified by Dr Z. L. Jung-Mendacolli  (Instituto de Botinica, .Sgo Paulo).  Extraction and isolation of constituents. Dried and powdered  leaves (314g) of A. macrophylla were extracted with 40%  EtOH-HzO.  The extract, dissolved in MeGH-Hz0  (9: 1) was  partitioned  into n-hexane, HCCI, and EtOAc. The EtOAc  solubles (2 g) were resolved by CC (silica gel. HCCI,-MeOH,  increasing polarity) into 22 frs. lb (23 mg) was separated from frs  l-2 by prep. TLC [silica gel, n-hexancEtOAc  (1: l)+O.S%  HOAc]. Fr. 11 submitted to prep. TLC (silica gel, CHCI,-EtzO,  3: 1) yielded la (6.5 mg). Frs 12-18 after prep. TLC [silica gel,  CHCI,-MeOH  (7: 3) + 2% HOAc] afforded lc (12 mg).  The acetone extract of the stems (160 g) of A. macrophylla was  also examined. After partition into the system MeOH-Hz0  (9: I)-n-hexane, the hexane solubles (660 mg) submitted to prep.  TLC (n-hexane_EtOAc, 4:l) led to the separation of: a- and  b-amyrin (2a+Ja,  198 mg), lupeol (4a, 20 mg), lupenone (4b,  80 mg), a-amirenone (2b, 27 mg), /J-amirenone (XI, 23 mg) and  germanicone (Jc, 39 mg).  2-Phenylerhyl cafleoare (lb).
