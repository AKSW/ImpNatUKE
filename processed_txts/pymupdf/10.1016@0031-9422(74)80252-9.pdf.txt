C. Smith) Kosterm. is a tree which grows in the Amazon region.  The trunk wood yielded borneol, nerohdol, elemol, sltosterol and a new compound,  Cz2Hz607, designated macrophyllm.  Functional  analysis, warranting expansion of the  formula to Cl ,H, 4O . OH(OMe),  . 02CHz. suggested this to be a bis-C, . C,-denvatlve.  One of the C, . C,-moieties must have structure 1, since the MS indicates cleavage of the  molecular ion into a fragment, m/e 192 (go%), which, m analogy with the predominant  fragment ions of related bwC, . C3-compounds,  such as gulanin (2),2 canellin-A (3)’ and  canellm-C (4),’ must be represented by 5. The PMR spectrum contams all the required  proton signals and shows that the two aromatlc protons are meta related. It 1s blogenetl-  tally improbable  that they are situated at the alternative  meta-positions,  because this  would require the &-side chain to occupy the para-position  to an unoxygenated  carbon.  The structure of the additional &-moiety  can be deduced from the remaining PMR sig-  nals. These reveal the existence of the three C,-sequences represented m6. The secondary  nature of the carbmol 1s documented by the large paramagnetlc  shift of the oxymethine  PMR singlet at T 5 80 which accompanies  acetylation  of macrophyllin  (A 1.35 ppm). In  addition, this reaction produces  virtually ldentlcal (A 0.08 and 009 ppm) diamagnetic  * Part 27 m the series “The Chemistry  of BrazIlian  Lauraceae”  For Part 26 see Ref  1 Taken  from part of  the M SC thesis submitted  by J G S M to the Umversldade  Federal  Rural do Rio de Janeiro (I 973) Sponsored  by Mmlstirlo  do PIaneJamento  (Flnancladora  de Estudos e ProJetos  S A ) and AssoclaCHo Braslleira  da Indlstria  FarmacCutlca  through  Academia  Brasdetra  de ClCnclas  ’ GILSBKLCHT,  A M , FKANCA,  N  C, GOTTLILB, 0 R and ROCHA,  A I d,t (1974) Phytoch~m~bti y 13, 2285  ’ BULOW, M V VON, FRANCA, N C, GOTTLIEB, 0 R and PUENTES SUAREZ,A M (1973) Phytochrmlstry  12,  1805  2839  2840  N C FKANCA.~ R GOTTLIEBL~ J G S MAIA  shifts of the singlets at T 6.53 and 6 68 attributed  to ahphattc  methoxyls.

This is due to the fact that the aryl group occupies the endo-  face of the molecule and thus, in contradistinction  to the aryl group of the canellms (3,  4), does not help in the discrimination of the methoxyls through differential shielding. Evi-  dence for the endo-arrangement  was seen in the fact that the hydroxyl at C-8 of macrophyl-  lin is as completely acetylated at room temp. as that of guianin (2) while under identical  conditions only monoacetates  are formed from the canellms A (3) and C (4).’ In these  cases, esterification of the hydroxyl at C-8 is incomplete, even at 60”, due, conceivably, to  the steric hindrance exerted by the exo-aryl group. The trans-relationship  of the aryl-  methyl substituents, as shown in the relative spatial representations  of macrophyllm (8 and  9) is based on the large coupling constant which characterizes JH_-6,H_7 (8.7 Hz) and the  normal chemical shift of the C-Me protons (z 9.08). A smaller coupling and a chemical  shift above z 9.3 would be expected for the cis-arrangement.’  OMe  OMe  bMe  dMe  I  b  Me0  HO  OMe  SCHEME I PROBABLEBIOGENETICPATHWAYTOMACROI'HYLLIN  EXPERIMENTAL  Llcana macrophylla Collectton Site Ducke Forest Reserve, Manaus,  Amazonas  Tree 15 m high.
