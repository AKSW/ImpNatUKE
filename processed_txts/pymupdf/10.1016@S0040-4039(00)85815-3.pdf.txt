Summary : With the help of Natural Abundance 13c _ 13 C Coupling Constants , observed  via double quantum coherence , the structural determination  of VELLOZIOLONE  (1) , a  new diterpene , has been carried out.  During the course of a continuing phytochemical  survey of Brazilian Velloziaceae  , we have  examined a sample of Vellozia caput-adeae L.B. Smith & Ayensu , a species occuring in Diaman-  tina , State of Minas Gerais , Brazil , from which a new diterpene , velloziolone  (1) was iso-  lated.With the help of 'INADEQUATE' n.m.r. experiments 1 we establish herein its structure.To  our knowledge , this example is the first application of the two-dimensional  Freeman technique lb  for studying a naturally occurring substance of unknown constitution.  578  The molecular formula of velloziolone  (1) , (C20H3202), m.p. 113-114°C  546  436  365  ,[U]  A  589  240  - 58.5  -60.8  -70.8  -135.2  -276.9  (c 0.83 , CHC13) , was determined by microanalysis  and by mass  spectrometry  [m/e 304.2377 (M+')] .Its 100 MHz  'H n.m.r. spectrum (CDC13) showed  the follo-  ing clearly resolved signals : three methyl singlets at 0.75 , 0.92 and 1.15 ppm and two ole-  finic protons at 4.92 and 5.02 ppm.Based on conventional carbon-13 n.m.r. data (Table) , on the  results given above and on the structure of other compounds isolated from Vellozia species 2 ,  two different seco-ent-kauren-16-eno  structures (1) and (2) were considered as a working hypo-  thesis for the new diterpene.  Carbon-13 n.m.r. spectral analysis of velloziolone was first attempted at 50.31 MHz with a  Bruker WM-200 spectrometer.The  double quantum pulse sequence was used la-This allowed the de-  tection of carbon-carbon  coupling constants at natural abundance with suppression of the strong  signals from molecules with a single carbon-13 nucleus.Although  , a number of matching satellite  pairs were identified from this experiment , the structure of velloziolone  (1) could not be es-  tablished.Ambiguities  were due to the close chemical shift of some resonances (Table) and espe-  cially  to coupled nuclei forming strong AB systems with reduced satellite intensities 3 .There-  fore , the spectral study was attempted again at 100.62 MHz with a Bruker WM-400 spectrometer.  A solution of velloziolone  (1) was prepared in dioxan-d8 [850 mg of (1) in 1 ml solvent] .As a  preliminary experiment , first an APT-type spectrum was measured 4.This defines the multiplicit;,  5267  5268  12  17  I?  2  2  3  3  19  18  19  18  (number of bound protons) for each carbon signal and allows the determination of the maximum  number of carbon connectivities  possible for each carbon atom.Then , the double quantum pulse  sequence was optimized for 'JCC = 44 Hz (Jr = l/4) in order to observe coupling constants  for both sp3-sp3 and sp*-sp3 type linkages with the maximum intensity in one experiment.Data  was accumulated at 95°C overnight using a recycle time of 4.33 sec.The number of data points  was 16K with a frequency range of 6040 Hz giving a digital resolution of 0.75 Hz/point.Reso-  lution enhancement with the Gaussian multiplication  technique was applied 5.  Analysis of the results permitted to recognize 17 one-bond and 1 two-bond matching sa-  tellite pairs (Table and Figure).Although  , this lD-INADEQUATE experiment suggested struc-  ture (1) for velloziolone , 5 one-bond coupling constants (J8 g , J,, g , J13 16 , J15 16  and J16 ,7) were missing from the spectrum based on formula (i).A choice betwien struciures  (1) and'(*) was extremely simple with the help of this powerful new n.m.r. technique.For  ins-  tance the latter structure would imply the 73.69 ppm carbon signal to be coupled with three  methylene type carbon resonances.However  , inspection of the spectral data indicates clearly  that the neighbours of the 73.69 ppm carbon signal are a methine , a methylene and a methyl  type resonance , in agreement with structure (1).  Missing satellites were due to carbon atoms involved in bonds with each of the two car-  bon atoms C-9 and C-16 , expected to have especially long relaxation times.It has been shown  previously that couplings to carbons exhibiting long T, values were suppressed or have given  strongly reduced satellites in intensity if the recycle time used was too short 2b,6 .However,  unambiguous evidence was afforded for the connectivity between C-8/C-9 and C-9/C-11 by the  detection of the two-bond coupling constant J8 ,, (Table).Such coupling constants (*Jcc)  through a ketone have been shown to be of the &der  of 9 - 12 Hz in cyclohexanone  systems  .  6  The lD-INADEQUATE  spectral analysis of terpenic molecules at high magnetic field is often  very difficult.Complications  are due to the similarity of most coupling constants and to the  rather important isotope shifts.Furthermore  , the coupling carbon pairs display AX or only  weak AB systems.  In order to establish the complete connectivity of the molecular framework of vellozio-  lone and to confirm the lD-n.m.r. results , a two-dimensional  study was undertaken on (1) as  described by Freeman lb .The two-dimensional  spectrum was recorded on the sample used in the  lD-INADEQUATE experiment , at 60°C in order to shorten spin-lattice  relaxation times.The data,  5269  carbon  C-l  43.71  42.5  c-2  20.99  20.3  c-3  42.40  42.1  c-4  35.91  35.2  C-5  58.64  57.9  C-6  22.19  21.9  C-l  38.48  38.1  C-8  57.93  57.4  c-9  c-10  c-11  c-12  c-13  c-14  43.84  42.7  c-15  42.38  41.4  C-16  154.17  152.2  c-17  106.28  106.4  C-18  22.07  21.2  c-19  33.19  32.6  c-20  24.18  23.5  TABLE  13 C n.m.r. spectral data for velloziolone (1) a  chemical shift b  95'C in 25'C in  dioxan-da  CDC13  211.93  213.8  73.69  73.9  36.14  35.8  34.07  33.6  43.25  42.3  coupled with  carbon  C  c-2  c-10  c-3  c-4  one-bond  coupling  constant  (Hz)  c-4  33.3  c-5  36.0  C-6  35.0  C-J  38.5  c-9  not measured  c-14  28.5  c-15  32.3  c-5  37.0  c-9  not measured  c-12  31.8  c-12  31.5  C-16  not measured  c-13  32.5  C-16  not measured  c-17  not measured  c-4  35.8  c-4  36.3  c-10  39.5  32.5  37.8  32.8  32.3  Ethe corresponding numbering scheme is given with the structural formula;  chemical shifts were measured in the conventional experiment (in CDCl )  with respect to internal TMS and in the INADEQUATEcexperiment with res ect  %  to dioxan-d  8  (66.5 ppm) and are given for TMS=O ;  coupling constants are  shown only nce for all coupling pairs at that nucleus where the J values  could be the more precisely determined.A two-bond coupling constant of 9.3  Hz was measured for J8 11.  I  optimized for maximum signal intensity with 'J  cc = 44 Hz , were accumulated overnight.Quad-  rature detection in both directions and a relaxation delay of 2.0 set were employed. The  spectral width for F, was 2 17241 Hz and for F2 was 20833 Hz.Directly coupled carbon-13 re-  sonances were identified by the fact that they generate the same double quantum frequency  and thus appear in one row of the two-dimensional  data matrix.  In addition to informations obtained by the lo-experiment , the 2D-INADEQUATE  spectrum  has permitted to determine the relationship of C-16 with respect to its neighbours.However,  the direct evidence for the connectivity of C-8/C-9 was not obtained as both of these qua-  ternary carbons have long T, values.The axial configuration of C-20 of (1) is obvious (23.5  5270  ,  44.0  43.0  ppm  Figure.Section  of C-13 , C-l and C-14 from the 100.62 MHz INADEQUATE 13C n.m.r.  spectrum of (1) recorded in dioxan-d  at 95“C.Maximum signal intensity has been  selected for 3 -44 Hz (Jt 1/4).Sat&lites  due to J  cannot be clearly de-  tected because%  the long T  value of C-16.Satellit&!'!lfie to 3  exhibit a typical strong AB System $J /Ay  0.55); at 50.31 MHz !.$i44A?~y~&!fi'3  (J /AV  1.1) could not be observed  .  ____________________~~~~~~~_______~~~__~_~~~~~~___~~~~~~~~_~~~~~~~~~~~_~~~~~~~~  ppm in CDC13) '.Chemical shifts of C-5 , C-8 and C-13 are in agreement 7 with the stereoche-  mistry shown which is the same in previously isolated related compounds 2a .  The digital resolution in this 2D-study was insufficient to determine precise coupling  Constants-The  latter (Table and Figure) result from the lD-INADEQUATE experiment described  above.It is worth noting that the low values of the coupling constants (Table) corresponding  to J8,14 and J11,12 reflect the o< ,  P  position of these linkages with respect to the C-9  6  ketone.Such an effect has been demonstrated previously on cyclohexanone systems  .  This investigation  illustrates the advantages of high magnetic field for structural  studies based on natural abundance 13c _ 13 C coupling constants.The  study could be completed  in spite of the unfavourable dispersion of the carbon signals , five of which appear in (1)  within 1.46 ppm in the 42 - 44 ppm region.  1.
