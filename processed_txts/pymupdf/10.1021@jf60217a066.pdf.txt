Ten replicate analyses of cotton plant samples with 10%  to 15% TNC gave standard deviations of 0.28 and 0.14,  respectively. The same degree of accuracy was obtained  when analyzing different parts of cotton plants and lyo-  philized cactus pads (Opuntia, s.P.) harvested at different  seasons of the year. These materials ranged from 10% to  70% TNC. The authors’ technique can be conducted for  about one-tenth the cost of other methods in use. A  complete analysis can be performed in 24 h elapsed time,  while other techniques require 3 to 4 days. It should also  be noted that a minimum of glassware is required. This  represents a saving of initial cost and routine glassware-  washing time. It is especially noteworthy that the de-  tergent action of the Teles’ reagent allows effective  cleansing of the Folin tubes by simple rinsing four times  with distilled water. In addition, it also allows the use of  a flow-through curvette. The reduced number of opera-  tions make the technique more accurate and less tedious.  The reagents used, in addition to being less expensive, can  be prepared with distilled water with no need for deionizers  or other water retreatment. The substitution of dini-  trosalicylic acid (Summer and Somer, 1949) for Teles’  reagent gave similar results. One technician easily ana-  lyzed an average of 96 samples in 24-h elapsed time.  In case the laboratory is equipped with only an ordinary  centrifuge (maximum speed ca. 1500 rpm), the use of 4 mL  of a 2% solution of neutral lead acetate (only the neutral  salt) in water instead of 4 mL of distilled water before  centrifugation also gives a clear supernatant. This amount  of lead salt does not interfere with the analysis as was  demonstrated in the course of the experiment with  comparative analyses. The lead precipitation also would  allow aliquot filtration, but the authors avoided this op-  eration since it increases time and cost.

Estragole, the major constituent of the essential oil of Croton aff. zehntneri, family Euphorbiaceae, occurs  together with minor quantities of camphor, anethole, isoborneol, caryophyllene, y-elemene, safrol,  methylisoeugenol, n-heptadecane, and n-eicosane. These compounds are being reported for the first  time in the genus Croton. Fifteen predominant volatile constituents of the oil were analyzed by GC-MS  and identified. The oil has a typical pleasant odor reminiscent of anise (Pimpinella anisum L.)  The genus Croton is largely disperse in the semiarid  lands of Brazilian Northeast and includes many species  that produce essential oils with pleasant odors.  This report deals with the examination of the volatile  constituents of Croton aff. tehntneri (canelinha) family  Euphorbiaceae collected in the state of CearB. The in-  fusion of the leaves is used by local people as a beverage  in place of coffee and as a remedy for stomachache and  insomnia.

No authentic samples available.  equipped with a stainless steel column (3 mm X 1.5 m)  packed with 1.5% OV-101 on Chromosorb W programmed  from 50-250 “C, at a rate of 4 “C/min, using N2 as the  carrier gas.  Preparative GLC was carried out using a modified FID  chromatograph (splitter 1OO:l) with a 9 mm x 6.5 m  aluminum column packed with 20% OV-210 on Chro-  mosorb W.  GC-MS separation was carried out with a glass column  (3 mm X 1.5 m) packed with 3% OV-1 on Chromosorb W  coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer operated at  70 eV.  Infrared spectra were obtained using liquid films.  NMR spectra were run in CCl,, using a 60 MHz in-  strument and TMS as internal standard. Double reso-  nance experiments were realized with the same above  conditions at room temperature.  Extraction of the Oils. The plant was collected in  Araripe-Cearb and transported to the laboratory in an  air-conditioned vehicle. Finely ground material was steam  distilled in a modified steam generator (Craveiro et al.,  1976); the oils were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and  sealed in all-glass vials under Nz.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The essential oils were obtained by steam distillation  of the leaves, stems, and wood in yields of 0.7, 2.5, and  0.273, respectively. The chemical composition of the above  oils is described in Table I.  The separations were performed initially with a GLC  analytical column, followed by analysis with a GC-MS  system. Whenever possible, preparative GLC was used to  allow NMR and IR confirmations. Previous work in the  essential oils of the Euphorbiaceae family, genus Croton  (Guenther, 1950; Bracho and Crowley, 1966; Craveiro et  al., 1976) do not make any reference to the present species  which is native to the Brazilian Northeast.  The presence of estragole, camphor, anethole, isoborneol,  caryophyllene, y-elemene, safrole, methylisoeugenol, n-  heptadecane, and n-eicosane is related for the first time  in the genus as far as we know. Estragole imparts to the  oil the characteristic flavor similar to anise seed oil.  Methyleugenol, a potent anhestesic (Carlini et al., 1976),  should be responsible for the pharmacological activity of  the plant infusions.
