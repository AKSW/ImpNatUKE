Pupo* Pages 1182 and 1183: Structures for 2 and 4 should be cor- rected as shown: Page 1183: In the structure elucidation description for 2 and 4, “On the other hand, the relative conﬁguration of the C8 and C20 positions of the chaetoviridins B (2) and D (4) was suggested to be cis by Takahashi et al.8 on the basis of the magnitude of the coupling constants (10.2 Hz in 2 and 9.7 Hz in 4). A qualitative analysis of the NOE experiments conﬁrmed this disposition. In particular, NOE interactions were detected between H-7CH3, H-8 and H-20, supporting the S-conﬁguration for C8 and C20.” should be corrected to “The relative conﬁguration of the C8 and C20 positions of the chaetoviridins B (2) and D (4) was suggested to be cis by Takahashi et al.8 on the basis of the magnitude of the coupling constants (10.2 Hz in 2 and 9.7 Hz in 4). More recently, structures of chaetoviridins B and D have been revised by Kingsland and Barrow23 that proposed an additional lactone ring in the structures. All the 1H and 13C NMR data for both proposals are coincident. Our HRESIMS data for compounds 2 and 4 conﬁrmed the cyclization of the hydroxyl group at C50 with the carboxylic acid at C1’ in the ﬁrst structures proposed by Takahashi et al.8 Therefore, structures of compounds 2 and 4 are in agreement with those proposed by Kingsland and Barrow.23” Page 1183: The sentence “The absolute conﬁguration of C50 could not be determined by this method as it was not possible to derivatize the secondary alcohol linked to this carbon.” should be removed.

There are two related compounds named as chaetoviridin E,9,23 and our data for 5 are in agreement with the ﬁrst published structure.9 The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused by these errors.
