Croton sonderianus Muell. Arg. is a shrub widespread  in the Brazilian Northeast and known in the region as  "marmeleiro preto". The bark is used in folk medicine for  treatment of gastric diseases. Hexane or benzene extracts  of its heartwood and roots have shown antifungal and  antibacterial activity against Saccharomyces cereuisiae,  Helminthosporium sp., Trichophyton mentagrophytes,  Polyporus sanguineus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus  aureus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. From the benz-  ene extract of the heartwood was isolated a new clerodane  diterpene possessing a spirolactone ring system and named  sonderianin whose structure and stereochemistry were  determined by X-ray crystallography,' a known coumarin,  and two new cleisthantane diterpenes.2  The leaves produce an essential oil which was analyzed  by open tubular glass capillary chromatography coupled  (1) Craveiro, A.

The first substance was deep blue in color and  was easily identified as guayazulene by comparison of its  spectral data (MS, IR, and 'H NMR) with those reported  in the literature.$'  The second was colorless and formed  readily upon treatment with an ethanolic solution of picric  acid a picrate of mp 95-98 "C. The substance, named  marmelerin (I),  -63.0" (c 1.0, CHC13), gave a positive  Erlich test for a furans and showed a characteristic UV  spectrum, XmaxMeoH 222, 255, 279, 289 nm (log e 4.32,4.18,  3.51, 3.42), for benzofuranoid compounds similar to di-  hydropyrocur~erenone.~ The molecular ion at m/z 214  as well as analysis of the 13C NMR spectrum, 15 peaks in  the PND spectrum, suggested CIBHISO for the molecular  formula. With residual coupling (SFORD), the 13C spec-  trum showed seven sp3 (four methyls, two methylenes, and  one methine) and eight sp2 (seven nonprotonated and one  CH) carbons (Table I). The 'H NMR spectrum showed  a sharp singlet at 6 6.90 (1 H, H-4) very similar to the  expected position of a proton located at the ortho position  to the oxygen in a benzofuran system related to pyrocur-  zerenone (4).9 The same spectrum presented a multiplet  centered at 6 3.60 (1 H, J = 7.0 Hz, H-8), one singlet at  6 2.30 (6 H, H-3 and H-lo), and another singlet at 6 2.20  (3 H, H-11) followed by a doublet at 6 1.20 (3 H, J = 7.0  Hz, H-12). Double resonance experiments showed coupling  between the protons located at 6 3.60 and 6 1.20 (Table  I). The absence of any absorption below 6 7.00 eliminated  the possibility of protons located at a positions in a furan  system, suggesting a tetrasubstituted furan ring.  The 13C NMR spectrum of marmelerin displayed a  protonated aromatic carbon absorption at 6 109.1, con-  sistent with an unsubstituted aromatic carbon ortho to an  oxygen substituent. This signal appeared as a double  quartet (J = 159,5.8 Hz) in the fully coupled 13C spectrum,  suggesting the existence of a methyl group attached to the  other ortho position. Selective decoupling by low-field  single-frequency irradiation at the frequency of absorption  of H-4 caused the appearance of C-4 as a single quartet  while irradiation at the methyl hydrogens' absorption  frequency caused the appearance of a C-4 as a doublet.  This establishes the relative position of the aromatic  methyl to the protonated carbon of the benzofuran system.  (5) Stenhagen, E.; Abrahamson, S.; McLafferty, F. W. 'Registry of  (6) Pouchert, J.

Hydrogenation of marmelerin for 56 h over Pt02 in  MeOH yielded a dihydroderivative (3), M+ = 216, with UV  absorptions in agreement with a dihydrobenzofuran. The  I  2  4  13C NMR spectrum shows only the six expected sp2 car-  bons (five singlets and one doublet in the SFORD spec-  trum) and nine sp3 carbons (two additional doublets in the  SFORD spectrum at 6 39.2 and 6 82.9 for the two sp3  carbons of the dihydrobenzofuran). A remarkable de-  shielding effect is seen on the two methyl resonances  (attached to C-1 and (2-2) which appear at 6 15.1 and 6 15.4  (Table I). The 'H NMR of the dihydro derivative dis-  played two new multiplets at 6 4.70 (1 H, H-2) and 6 3.25  (2 H, H-1 and H-8) and the furan methyls now appeared  as doublets at 6 1.30 (3 H, J = 8 Hz, H-9) and 6 1.45 (3 H,  J = 8 Hz, H-10). The aromatic proton, 6 6.50 (1 H, H-4),  now absorbs at a more shielded position. Similar resonance  shift behavior was also observed for the dihydrobenzofuran  analogue prepared from c-caesalpin.lo  From this analysis it was possible to propose two  structures for marmelerin, (1 and Z), where the position  of (2-12 could not be directly inferred from the spectral  data. Structure 1 was supported as the isomer which  follows the isoprene rule, making possible a biogenetic  route for 1 through a normal head-to-tail linkage of the  isoprene units depicted on structure 3.  Structure 1 was confirmed by a two-dimensional  "INADEQUATE" experiment for 13C NMR analysis of  marmelerin where carbon-carbon connectivities were de-  (10) Balmain, A.; Bjamer, K.; Connolly, J.

A connectivity plot was obtained  which is shown in Figure 1. This plot is a contour plot  of the NMR data in which the peaks are viewed from  above. The doublets arising from the spin-coupled nuclei  appear as two pairs of spots on the same horizontal level  at the chemical shift frequencies of the coupled nuclei. All  of the signals are symmetrically located about a diagonal  line through the plot, which aids in distinguishing them  from noise or other artifacts. In a few cases, only one peak  of the doublet was strong enough to detect, but this re-  sulted in no loss of information in view of the symmetry  property described above.  Multiplicities of each of the 15 13C peaks were deter-  mined by the APT te~hnique.'~ Spin-lattice relaxation  times for the carbon atoms without a directly bonded  proton were measured and found to fall in the range from  20 to 30 s. Since this would have required an excessively  long delay between pulses in the connectivity experiment,  a few miligrams of chromium acetyl acetonate were added  to the solution of 250 mg of marmelerin in 1 mL of CDCl,.  Connectivities determined by inspection of Figure 1 are  listed in Table I.  The connectivities, multiplicities, and chemical shifts  not only allow an unequivocal choice between structures  1 and 2 but also completely specify the structure of mar-  melerin as l. The unobserved connectivity c-2 to c-l  cannot represent the position of the heteroatom, since the  chemical shift of C-1 is incompatible with an sp2 carbon  bonded directly to oxygen, while the chemical shifts of C-3a  and C-2 are both compatible with the benzofuranoid  portion of the structure.  As marmelerin is the first natural sesquiterpene con-  taining a tetrasubstituted furan, and thus is the first ex-  ample of a new structural class of sesquiterpenes, we were  concemed that it bad not been generated as a result of the  heating during distillation.

Evaluation of the biological activity of mar-  melerin as an antimicrobial showed that it is lacking in  activity. Work on identification of those substances  present in the extracts with antimicrobial activity con-  tinues.  Experimental Section  'H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian EM-390 spec-  trometer operating in a CW mode, wing CXI3 solution and Me4%  as internal standard. The '3c NMR experiments were recorded  on a JEOL JNM-FXGO (15.03 MHz) or on a Varian XL-300 (75.0  MHz) spectrometer, which were operated in FT mode, using  CDCl, solutions. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million  (ppm) relative to Me4% as internal standard. Proton noise de-  coupled (PND) and f d y  coupled (GATED decoupled: decoupler  off during acquisition time) were obtained with the FX60 by  centering the decuupler frequency 500 Hz below Me,Si with a noise  bandwidth of 1.0 KHz, a pulse angle of 45O, a pulse repetition  of 6.0 s, a sweep width of 4000 Hz, and 8K data points. Single-  frequency off-resonance decoupled (SFORD) spectra were ob-  tained with the proton decoupler set at 1000 Hz downfield from  the signal for Me4%. Law-power selective proton decoupling was  accomplished with a decoupler power of 26 dB. The two-di-  mensional 13C INADEQUATE experiment was performed with  the XL-300 spectrometer at 75 MHz, using 250 mg of marmelerin  in 1.0 mL of CDCI,. A few milligrams of chromium acetyl ace-  tonate was added to the solution to bring the TI  values for the  non-protonated carbons from 20-30 s down into the range of 1-2  a. The solution was placed in a 10-mm sample tube and prevented  from vortexing upon rotation by a Teflon-brand plug. The length  of the liquid column was a good match to the 2-cm length of the  receiver coil. The 13C spectral width was 12 kHz (160 ppm) with  an aquisition time of 0.085 s (2048 data points). Data was ac-  cumulated for 320 repetitions of the pulse sequence, with a 3-8  recovery delay between sequences. After weighting with an ex-  ponential function 6-Hz line broadening), the weighted FID was  Fourier transformed. A total of 128 separate spectra were obtained  in this way with an incremental increase in the delay between  the 90' pulse which created the double quantum coherence and  the 135' pulse which reconverted it to observable magnetization.  The evolution of the double quantum frequency appeared as a  modulation of the two pairs of 13C doublets arising from bonded  13C nuclei and could be observed by Fourier transformation of  the 128-point interferogram formed by each data point in the  spectrum. The resulting two-dimensional array was plotted as  a contour plot (looking down from above) with the 13C chemical  shift as the x axis and the double quantum frequency they axis.  The spectral width in the double quantum dimension was 12 kHz.  For both  and IH NMR spectra, the descriptions ares = singlet,  d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, and m = multiplet. Infrared  spectra were taken on a Perkin-Elmer 281B infrared spectrometer.  Mass spectra were recorded by using a Finnigan 3200 GC/MS  m w  spectrometer coupled tom INCOS data system. CD spectra  were obtained on a JASCO 5-40 automatic recording spectropo-  larimeter using methanol solutions. UV spectra were recorded  on a Beckman spectrometer Acta I11 with methanol solutions.  Specific rotation was obtained on a Perkin-Elmer 141 polarimeter  using chloroform solutions.  Silica gel column chromatography employed MN silica gel 60  (7+270 mesh) or MN silica gel G/UV,, for thin-layer chroma-  tography. TLC analysis was performed by utilizing MN preeoated  plates and detection of compounds was achieved hy spraying with  a prepared solution of EtOHlp-anisaldehydelAcOH (9051) to  which 5% by volume of concentrated H,SO, had been added  immediately before use. All solvents used for chromatography  purposes were A.R. grade or distilled before use. The melting  point of the picrate was determined in a Fisher digital melting  point analyzer Model 355 and was not corrected.  Plant Material. The whole plant was collected in Sobral,  Ceara, Brazil, and identified by Prof. Afranio G. Fernandes. The  voucher specimens representing the collection are deposited at  the herbarium uf the Departamento de Botanica, Universidade  Federal do Ceara, Fortaleza-CE, 60.000, Brazil. The fresh leaves  J. Org. Chem. 1984,49, 5157-5160  5157  were steam distilled to give a blue essential oil (0.33%) which was  distilled at reduced pressure (15 mmHg) to produce different  fractions of clear oil and a residue (bp 260-265 "C). This residue  (120 mL) was mixed with 300 g of silica gel 60 packed into a  cylindrical decantation funnel and eluted with 1.5 L of hexane.  The eluent was combined into 12 fractions based on TLC com-  parison. The column was then washed with EtOAc/MeOH (5%)  to yield a brown, viscous oil. Fractions 1-4 (60 g) yielded a mixture  of terpenes which was analyzed by the method of Craveiro et a L 3 9 1 4   The following terpenes were identified: a- and 0-pinene,  camphene, myrcene, limonene, y-terpinene, camphor, terpinen-  4-01, copaene, p-elemene, a-gurjunene, cyperene, P-caryophyllene,  thujopsene, trans-0-farnesene, y- and 6-cadinene, y-muurolene,  and palustrol.  Fractions 5-9 (2.5 g) yielded a dark blue oil that was rechro-  matographed on a column of silica gel G (25 g) using hexane as  eluent and nitrogen pressure to produce a convenient flow rate.  Guayazulene (50 mg) and 240 mg of pure marmelerin (l), as a  clear, colorless oil were obtained. An additional 140 mg of 1 were  also obtained from the less polar fraction of the neutral part of  the hexane extract of roots by elution with hexane of a similar  type of silica gel column.

Two Steroidal Alkaloids from a Marine Sponge, Plakina sp.  Richard M. Rosser and D. John Faulkner*  Scripps Institution of Oceanography (A-012F), La Jolla, California 92093  Received June 18, 1984  The antimicrobial metabolites of Plakina sp., a marine sponge that overgrows coral heads, are the steroidal  alkaloids dakinamine A (1) and dakinamine B (2). The structures were elucidated bv intermetation of sDectral  data andby comparison'of the -13C NMR data' with  Steroidal alkaloids are well-known metabolites of certain  terrestrial plants,l but they have not been reported pre-  viously from marine organisms. During a search for an-  tibiotics from marine invertebrates, we encountered a  sponge of the genus Plakina whose crude extracts showed  antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and  Candida albicans. Bioassay-directed fractionation of the  crude extract led to the isolation of two steroidal alkaloids,  plakinamine A (1) and plakinamine B (2) (Chart I). The  structures of the two steroidal alkaloids were elucidated  by interpretation of spectral data and comparison with  model compounds synthesized from ergosterol.  The sponge, Plakina sp., was collected in shallow waters  (-5 m) at Mant Island, Ponape, where it was observed to  overgrow and kill corals. A methanolic extract of the  freeze-dried sponge was found to possess antimicrobial  activity. Solvent partition was followed by chromatogra-  phy on Sephadex LH-20 (methanol) and Sephadex G-15  (water) to obtain an active fraction containing one major  (1) The steroidal alkaloids are regularly reviewed in "The Alkaloids",  Specialist Periodical Reports, Royal Society of Chemistry, London, Vols.  1-13, 1971-1983.  0022-326318411949-5157$01.50/0  those of model compounds syhthesiied from ergisterol.  and one minor component. The minor metabolite, plak-  inamine B (2, 0.1% dry weight), was obtained as a hy-  drochloride salt by fractional crystallization from methanol.  The major metabolite, plakinamine A (1,0.3% dry weight),  was separated from the residue by taking advantage of its  solubility in aqueous acid.  The steroidal nature of plakinamine A (1) was suggested  by the molecular formula, C29H46N2,  and by lH NMR  signals at 6 0.59 (s, 3 H) and 0.77 (s, 3 H)  and two 13C NMR  signals at 6 12.0 (9) that could be assigned to the C-18 and  C-19 methyl groups of a steroid. A striking feature of the  13C NMR spectrum was the presence of five signals at 6  >loo; the signals at 6 117.7 (d) and 139.2 (5) were in good  agreement with literature values for C-7 and C-8 of a A'  sterol2 while the signals at 6 173.2 (s), 137.1 (s), and 129.0  (s) could be assigned to a fully substituted double bond  and an imine group. The ultraviolet chromophore at 246  nm (e 7100) implied the presence of an a$-unsaturated  imine. A major fragmentation in the mass spectrum gave  peaks at m/z 123.1052 (C8HI3N, base peak), 299.2645  (C21H33N), and 300.2721 (C21H34N) that could be explained  (2) Blunt, J. W.; Stothers, J. B. Org.
