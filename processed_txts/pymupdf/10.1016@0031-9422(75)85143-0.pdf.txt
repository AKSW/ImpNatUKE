Myristicaceae;  2R.4H-dihydroxy-lo-piperon~leicosant)ic  acid ;t-lactone;  Juruenolide  The chemical  investigation  of the trunk wood of  a specimen  of Iryanthem  juruemis  Warb.  (Myristi-  caceae),  revealed  the presence  of sitosterol,  sitos-  tenone,  (+)-2’-hydroxy-7-methoxy-4’S’-methy-  lenedioxyflavan  [l]  and  a lactone,  C,,H,,O,,  designated  juruenolide.  The PMR  spectra  of the  compound  and of its acetate allowed  expansion  of  the formula  to la. This contains  a piperonylethyl  unit (z 3,3- 3.5. 3ArH;  4.16, 0zCH2  ; 7.53, r, J 7.5  Hz. ArCI&CH2),  a methylene  chain (z X.3- 8.8. 15  CH2). whose signal covers an additional  one H sig-  nal. and  a hydroxy-y-lactone  unit  (la  \I,,,~~ 1745  cm _ ’ ; lb vmaX 1770, 1730 cm- 1 ). The allocation  of  the hydroxyl  to C-2 and of the methylene  chain  to  C-4 of this lactone was based on the analysis  of the  signals  associated  with  its 2 oxymethine  and  2  methylene  protons.  The latter can only be situated  on C-3. Double  irradiation  experiments  revealed  one of them (T 8.7) to be coupled  to H-4 (T 552)  and the other one (z 7.44) to H-2 (t 5.881.

Coupling  and absence  of coupling  was  seen as evidence,  respectively,  for its ci.\-relation  to  H-4 and tru/zs-relation  to H-2. An identical  conclu-  sion about  the relative  stereochemistry  ofjurucno-  lide was reached  upon  observing  the coupling  of  the relatively  deprotected  (r 7,441, and hence ~IILI,S;-  equatorial.

Phytochemical  Reports  591  The biogenetic origin of juruenolide  (la) could  involve condensation  of a C, ,-fatty acid precursor  (2) with an activated cinnamic acid (3) via an inter-  mediate such as 4. The additional oxygenation  of  2 has been postulated  previously  to explain the  biosynthesis of the avocatins and the rubrenolides  [I], constituents of the Lauraceae, a family which  is morphologically  closely related with the Myris-  ticaceae.
