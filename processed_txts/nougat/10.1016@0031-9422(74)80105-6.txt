Abstract
Two novel peltogynoids, 7-(O)-methylpeltogynol and 4-(O)-methyl-4,5'-(O),0-methylidenemopanol were isolated respectively from the trunk wood of Peltogyne paniculata Benth. and P. confertiflora Benth. The latter species, as well as P.__catingae Ducke, also contain the common peltogynoids peltogynol and mopanol.
Peltogyne, 7-(O)-methylpeltogynol, 4-(O)-methyl-4,5'-(O),0-methylidenemopanol, fraxetin.
A recent investigation of Goniorrhadnis marginata Taub. (Leguminosae-Caesalpinioideae) revealed the existence in its heartwood of peltogynoid flavonones and chalcones.1,2 The genus was, consequently, considered to have evolved into Peltogyne, the known species of which contain mainly peltogynoid flavonols.2 Since Goniorrhadnis is monotypic, the only way of placing this hypothesis on firmer ground and, eventually, to use it as basis of a phyletic classification of related genera, requires the analysis of additional Peltogyne species.
A search for peltogynoids in the bark of Peltogyne confertiflora Benth. (from Espirito Santo State), P.__catingae Ducke and P.__paniculata Benth. (both from Amazonas State) was unsuccessful. Only a glycoside of fraxetin (7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin) was located in P.__confertiflora. The heartwoods, however, of P.__catingae and P.__confertiflora were found to contain peltogynol (1a) and mopanol (2a), typical constituents of Peltogyne and related genera. From the C6H6 extracts of P.__paniculata and P.__confertiflora two additional phenols, respectively C17H16O6 and C18H16O6, were isolated. Their UV spectra were very similar to those of peltogynol and mopanol, so they were considered to be closely related peltogynoids. Comparisons of the PMR spectra in the acetate series not only confirmed this (see chemical shifts of aliphatic protons with lit.3 data), but also indicated identical relative configurations at the chiral centres 2, 3 and 4 (cf. (J)2,3 and (J)3,4). Attribution of the substitution pattern of peltogynol to C17H16O6 and of mopanol to C18H16O6 was based on the analysis of the aromatic spectral regions.

The peltogynol derivative harbours a catechol system (UV shift by H3BO3 + NaOAc) and an aliphatic hydroxyl ((\nu_{\max }^{\text{KBr}}) of acetate 1730 cm-1). Its methoxyl ((\tau 6\cdot 27), s) can thus occupy only position 7, as in 1c, a proposition which is consistent with the MS of the triacetate 1d which contains evidence for an aliphatic acetoxyl [(M-AcOH)-382] and a methoxylated A-ring (retro-Diels-Alder fragments m/e 152, 153).
In agreement with this both peltogynol (1a) and the new (1c), yield tri-O-methylpeltogynol (1g) upon methylation either with Me2SO4-K2CO3 in boiling Me2CO or with CH2N2 in ether at -10deg. The CH2N2-methylation of peltogynol at -10deg is a stepwise reaction and, using appropriate reaction times, can be used to produce the natural compound 1c (48 hr), a separable mixture of 7-O-methyl- (1c), 7,3'-di-O-methyl-(1e) and 7,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ethers (1g) (96 hr), or mainly 7,3',4'-tri-O-methylpeltogynol (250 hr). Two additional compounds, probably insertion products,4 were also detected in trace amounts in these reaction mixtures. The substitution pattern of the novel 7,3'-di-O-methylpeltogynol (1e) was identified through PMR spectral comparison (CDCl3) of two pairs of compounds: its monomethyl ether (1g) and its diacetate (1f) vs 7-O-methylpeltogynol triacetate (1d) and peltogynol tetraacetate (1b).3 The 3'-positions in the first pair are substituted by methoxyls and in the second pair by acetoxyls. In consequence, H-2' of 1g and 1f resonates at higher field (resp. (\tau 2\cdot 82) and (2\cdot 90)) than H-2' of 1d and 1b (resp. (\tau 2\cdot 49) and (2\cdot 53)).

The methylenedioxy group (t 406, s) of the mopanol derivative C18H16O6 can, of course, occupy only the 4',5'-positions. Three pieces of evidence show that the methoxyl (t 6:38, s) is at C-4:(1). The H-4 chemical shifts of the acetate (2e) and of tri-O-acetylmopanol (2b) are comparable (t 5:35 and 5:33), suffering the expected large downfield shift (D -1:59 ppm) if the hydroxyl at C-4 appears in acetylated form, as in 2c (2). The MS of the derivative (Scheme 1) conforms to the pattern observed for other flavanols of this series,2 with the exception of the [M-H2O]+: peak which is replaced by a strong [M-MeOH]+: peak (3). While tri-O-methylmopanol (2f) and tri-O-methylpeltogynol (Ig) readily give tri-O-methylmopanone and tri-O-methylpeltogynone with the Jones reagent, the novel phenol is quite stable under oxidizing conditions. Thus, the lone phenolic hydroxyl can only be situated at C-7, as in 2d.

Selective methylation of peltogynol (1a). An Et2O soln of 1a was treated with CH2N2-Et2O (-10', 48 hr). The reaction product was separated by TLC into two cmpds, identified, by direct comparison, with starting material and natural 1c. Upon extending the time interval to 96 hr, tri-O-methylpeltogynol was present in the reaction product. After 250 hr 1c had disappeared. The reaction product, in CHCl3, was extracted with 5", 1a9. NaHCO3. The evaporated CHCl3 soln gave 1g, identified by direct comparison with the Me2SO4-methylation product of peltogynol. Acidification of the aq. soln gave 1c.
