Abstract
The trunk wood of Iryanthera polynerura Ducke (Myrsticaceae) contains pinocembrin,1-(2',4'-dihydro-xyphenyl)-3-(3'',4''-methylenedioxyphenyl)-propane,1-(2',4'-dihydroxy-3'-methylphenyl)-3-(2''-methoxy-4'',5''-methylenedioxyphenyl)-propane and 4,2',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxydihydrochalcone.
INTRODUCTION
The nomadic and very primitive Maku Indians of the Apaporis basin (Amazonia) employ a plaster made of the crushed leaves of Iryanthera polynerura Ducke (Myrsticaceae) for treating seriously infected wounds and cuts [3]. This ethnopharmacological observation stimulated interest in the chemistry of the tree, and a study on the composition of its trunk wood was undertaken. The results are reported in the present paper.
RESULTS
Fractionation of a benzene extract of the trunk wood afforded, besides sitosterol and pinocembrin, the 1,3-diarylpropane 1a, previously obtained from I. coriacea Ducke [4], two novel compounds, the additional diary-propane 1c and the dihydrochalcone 2a, and a small quantity of a mixture containing two chalconestentitively formulated 3a and 3b.
The basic structure of the diarylpropane, C15H10-Me(OH)2OMe.O2CH2, was indicated by 1H and 13C NMR spectral evidence which pointed to a CH2.CH2. CH2 chain flanked by two aryl groups. One must bear 2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxy substitutions. The base peak in the MS shows the correct mass for a methoxyphenylenedioxytropylim ion; the 1H NMR spectrum includes two singlets (6 3.34 and 3.42). The other aryl group bears 2,4-dihydroxy-3-methyl substitution. The 1H NMR spectrum includes two doublets (6.36 and 6.72, (J) = 8 Hz); oxidation of the compound does not lead to ortho or para-quinones; a 13C NMR quartet at high field (6 8.9)is compatible only with a methyl between two vicinal substituents [5]. The 13C NMR assignments for this 1,3-diarylpropane (2c) are compatible with the analogous data for 1a [4] and virolane (1b) (see Experimental), previously obtained from Virola multimeria Ducke [6].
The basic structure of the dihydrochalcone, C15H10-(OH)3OMe, was indicated by 1H and 13C NMR spectral evidence which pointed to a CH2.CH2 group flanked by benzoyl and aryl substituents. The benzoyl group must be 2,4-dihydroxyidated: the molecule has chelated and acidic hydroxyls evidenced by IR and UV (AlCl4 and NaOAc shifts) spectra; acetylation produces NMR shifts of the aromatic C signals which are closely comparable with the values observed for 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone (see Experimental). The aryl group must bear 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy substitution: the two oxy-functions are located at C-3 and C-4 (H-2, H-5 and H-6 give a NMR multiplet at 6.7-6.9); acetylation produces paramagnetic shifts
Page 2
(+5.1 to +7.6 ppm) of the C-1, C-3 and C-5 signals, and a small diamagnetic shift (-2.1 ppm) of the C-4 signal, leaving the C-2 and C-6 signals practically unaffected. The MS of this dihydrochalcone (2a) is accordingly very simple, since both the dihydroxbgenzoyl ion and the hydroxypropylium ion have m/e 137.
The constituents of a mixture obtained in minute amount were tentatively characterized as chalcones 3a and 3b by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Not only the molecular peaks 286 (55 %) and 300 (45 %) of the MS, but also the fragment peaks due to dihydroxybenzoyl (m/e 137 (100 %)), hydroxy-methoxystyryl (_m/e 150 (80 %)) and dimethoxystyryl (_m/_e 164 (50 %)) ions, were consistent with this hypothesis.
Discussion
The biosynthesis of cinnamylphenols in Leguminosae was postulated to involve the cinnamylation of triacetate moieties [7]. The fact that both the Leguminosae and the Myristicaceae are isoflavonoid accumulators invites the hypothesis that, as a further common biochemical feature, cinnamylation also occurs in both families, the 1,3-diarylpropanes of Myristicaceae being simply hydrogenation products of intermediate cinnamylphenols. It has, nevertheless, been suggested recently that the co-occurrence of 1,3-diarylpropanes with 1,3-diarylpropan-2-ols and flavans points to their biosynthetic derivation from chalcones [8], a postulate which allows now additional support by the isolation of a flavanone and, most importantly, by the co-occurrence of chalcone-dihydrochalcone-1,3-diarylpropane with identical oxygenation pattern in Iryanthera polyneura.
Experimental
Isolation of the constituents. Trunk wood of Iryanthera polyneura was collected near Manaus, Amazonas State, and identified by the botanist Dr. William A. Rodrigues. A ({\text{C}}{6}{\text{H}}{6}) extract (4 %, 200 g) was chromatographed on a Si gel column. Petrol, ({\text{C}}{6}{\text{H}}{6})-CHCl3 and MeOH eluted, in order, aliphatic (100 g), aromatic (40 mg) and aliphatic (50 g) fractions. The aromatic fraction (25 g) was rechromatographed on a Si gel column. The following solvents eluted, in order, the indicated compounds ({\text{C}}{6}{\text{H}}{6}): 1c (150 mg) and pinocembrin (120 mg), ({\text{C}}{6}{\text{H}}{6})-CHCl3 8:2: sitosterol (500 mg). ({\text{C}}{6}{\text{H}}{6})-CHCl3 1:1:1a (1 g), a mixture of 3a and 3b (8 mg after purification by aq. ({\text{N}}{2}{\text{C}}{3})) and 2a (160 mg).
