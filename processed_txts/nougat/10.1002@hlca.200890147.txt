Abstract
Phytochemical investigation from the stems of Alibertia edulis led to the isolation and identification of a new iridoid 6_b_-hydroxy-7-epigardoside methyl ester (1) and a new saponin 3_b_-O_-[a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 - 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranosyl]-28-O-b-d-glucopyranoside pomolate (2), along with three known compounds, shanzhiside methyl ester (3), ixoside (4), and 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl 1-O-b_-d-apifofuranosyl-(1 - 6)-O-b-d-glucopyranoside (5). The structures of 1 and 2 were established on the basis of their spectroscopic data. Iridoid 1 and saponin 2 exhibited moderate inhibitory activities against Candida albicans and C. krusei in a dilution assay.
Introduction
- Albertia edulis (Rich.) A. Rich. ex DC, commonly known as'marmelada-bola', is widely spread in the Brazilian 'Cerrado'. The Alibertia genus is known for the occurrence of iridoids, triterpenoids and phenolic derivatives [2-6]. Recent phytochemical investigations of stems of A. macrophylla led to the isolation of a diterpene, 2(b),3(a),16_a_-trihydroxy ent-kaurane [5]. Previous studies of the leaves of A. edulis resulted in the isolation of ten triterpenes [7]. In our continuing chemical and biological investigations of the Brazilian Rubiaceae plant species, we report the isolation and structure elucidation of a new iridoid, 6_b_-hydroxy-7-epigardoside methyl ester (1), and a new saponin 3_b_-O_-[a-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 - 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranosideyl-(1 - 2)-O-b-d-glucopyranoside pomolate (2), from A. edulis stems together with known iridoids: shanzhiside methyl ester (3) and ixoside (4), and phenolic derivative 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl 1-O-b_-d-apifuranosyl-(1 - 6)-O-b-d-glucopyranoside (5). We also report strong antifungal activity against pathogenic Candida-species yeast and Cryptococcus neoformans of the AcOEt extract of this species and, the moderate antifungal activity of compounds 1 and 2.

Results and Discussion. - The EtOH extract prepared from dried and powdered stems of A. edulis was submitted to partition in hexane, AcOEt, and BuOH. The preliminary biological screening indicated that the AcOEt extract showed antifungal activity (cf. Table 4). Fractionation and purification over silica RP-18 led to the isolation of compounds 1 - 5. The known compounds 3 - 5 were identified by comparing their spectroscopic data to those reported in literature [8-10].
Compound 1 was obtained as a white amorphous powder. The HR-ESI-MS of 1 showed a peak at m/z 403.1289 ([M - H]-), determining the molecular formula as being C17H24O11, and a peak at m/z 241.0738 ([M - H - 162]-), corresponding to the loss of a hexose moiety. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopic data were consistent with a b-glucopyranosyl unit and an iridoid aglycone. The 1H-NMR spectrum showed signals at d(H) 7.34 (d, (J) = 1.0, H - C(3)) and 5.61 (d, (J) = 2.0, H - C(1)) corresponding to an iridoid dihydropyran ring. The signal at d(H) 3.64 (s, 3 H) corresponded to a MeO group, and the signal at d(H) 5.21 (d, (J) = 2.5, 2 H) corresponded to an exocyclic =CH2 group. An anomeric H-atom signal at d(H) 4.41 (d, (J) = 8.5) confirmed the presence of a sugar residue with b-configuration. The 13C-NMR spectrum of 1 showed 17 signals. The C-atom signals at d(C) 35.5 (C), 41.8 (C), 95.0 (CH), 107.9 (C) and 152.2 (CH) were attributed to C-atoms C(5), C(9), C(1), C(4), and C(3), respectively of the dihydropyran ring of the iridoid aglycone. The remaining C-atoms signals, d(C) 73.7 (CH) and 73.5 (CH) were assigned to C(6) and C(7), respectively, and the signals at d(C) 110.0 (CH2(10)) and 150.4 (C(8)) were attributed to an exo-methylene function present in the structure. The _g_HMBC spectrum confirmed the assignment of C(6) and
Page 3
C(7) due to the ({}^{3})J-correlation observed between H(-)C(10) ((\delta)(H) 5.21) and C(7) ((\delta)(C) 73.5). The attachment of the (\beta)-d-glucopyranosyl moiety in 1 was established as in C(1) position in the aglycone, on the basis of the cross-peak correlations, in g_HMBC, between H(-)C(1') ((\delta)(H) 4.41) and C(1) ((\delta)(C) 95.0) (_Table 1).
The (\alpha)-orientation of H(-)C(1) and (\beta)-orientation of H(-)C(5) and H(-)C(9) is in accordance with the biosynthetic origin of the iridoids [11]. The coupling constant between H(-)C(5) and H(-)C(6) ((J) < 1.0 Hz), together with the upfield shift of C(1) ((\delta)(C) 95.0), and the calculation of the shift difference between C(3) and C(4) ((\Delta\delta) = 44.3) indicated that the orientation of the OH group at C(6) was (\beta)[12]. The appearance of H(-)C(6) as a broad singlet ((\delta)(H) 4.08) provided a small coupling constant between H(-)C(6) and H(-)C(7) ((J) < 1.0 Hz), corresponding to a dihedral angle close to 90({}^{\circ}), necessitating a trans-relationship between these H-atoms, which suggested the (\alpha)-orientation of the OH group at C(7) [13]. This configuration was confirmed on basis of NOESY interactions between H(-)C(5) ((\delta)(H) 2.81) and H(-)C(9) ((\delta)(H) 3.12 - 3.15, (\beta)-oriented), and no interactions between H(-)C(6) or H(-)C(7). Thus, the structure of compound 1 was elucidated as 6(\beta)-hydroxy-7-epigardoside methyl ester.
Compound 2 was obtained as a brown amorphous powder. The HR-ESI-MS of 2 showed a peak at (m/z) 1127.5641 (([M+{\rm Na}]^{+})), corresponding to the molecular formula C({}{54})H({}{88})O({}_{23}). The ({}^{1})H-NMR spectrum showed signals of seven Me groups at (\delta)(H) 0.81, 0.90, 0.99, 1.14, 1.23, 1.36 ((s), each 3 H), and 0.96 ((d,J) = 6.7, 3 H), and an olefinic H-atom at (\delta)(H) 5.33 (br. (s)). The ({}^{13})C-NMR data confirmed the presence of seven Me C-atom signals at (\delta)(C) 15.8, 16.4, 16.7, 17.5, 24.6, 27.0, and 28.6, and a pair of olefinic C-atoms at (\delta)(C) 129.6 and 139.5, suggesting that the aglycone possesses an urs-12-ene skeleton. In the _g_HSQC spectrum, the long-range correlations observed for Me groups at (\delta)(H) 1.23
Page 4
(s, Me(29)) and 0.96 (d, (J) = 6.7, Me(30)) with a quaternary C-atom at d(C) 73.5, together with the multiplicity of H - C(18) at d(H) 2.55 (s), observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum, were consistent with the aglycone pomolic acid (Table 2) [14].
The presence of four sugar moieties was established from the signals of four anomeric H-atoms at d(H) 4.44 (d, (J) = 7.7), 4.91 (d, (J) = 7.6), 5.22 (br. s), and 5.36 (d, (J) = 8.1), attached to the C-atoms at d(C) 105.5, 101.8, 101.9, and 95.6, respectively, in the _g_HSQC spectrum. The C-atom signals observed at d(C) 92.1 (C(3)) and 178.5 (C(28)) in the aglycone are consistent with a bidesmoside saponin moiety. Glycosylation of the alcoholic function at C(3) and esterification of the C(28)OOH group were indicated by the downfield shift (+13.9 ppm) and upfield shift (-2.1 ppm) observed, respectively, for the resonance of these C-atoms in 2, relative to the corresponding signals in pomolic acid [14].
To confirm our assumption regarding the glycosidic composition of this compound, an ESI-IT-MS({}^{n}) experiment was performed. In the ESI-IT-MS({}^{n}) spectrum, the peak at 
Page 5
(m/z) 1103 was assigned to a deprotonated molecule (([M-{\rm H}]^{-})) of compound 2. An adduct at (m/z) 1139 was observed, and it was tentatively assigned to ([M-{\rm H}+2) H2O]-, which could result from the use of H2O to dissolve the sample [15]. The second order fragmentation of the adduct (m/z) 1139 led to a base peak at (m/z) 941 (([M-162-{\rm H}]^{-})), indicating the loss of a hexose moiety. The MS3 fragmentation from this ion ((m/z) 941) gave a product ion at (m/z) 795 (([M-162-146-{\rm H}]^{-})), corresponding to the loss of a deoxyhexose moiety. MS4 fragmentation from the ion (m/z) 795 yielded a peak at (m/z) 633 (([M-(2\times 162)-146-{\rm H}]^{-})), due to the loss of a second hexose moiety, and the MS5 fragmentation of this precursor ion produced a product ion at (m/z) 471 (([M-(3\times 162)-146-{\rm H}]^{-})), corresponding to the loss of a third hexose moiety and is in agreement with the molecular weight of the aglycone pomolic acid.
The structures of the sugar moieties were deduced by 1D-TOCSY and 2D-NMR experiments (Table 3). The 1D-TOCSY method [16] allowed the subsectrum of a single monosaccharide unit to be extracted from the crowded overlapped region. Selected 1D-TOCSY data obtained by irradiation of each anomeric H-atom signal yielded the subsectrum of each sugar residue. Thus, the shifts of the sugar resonances were attributable to an (\alpha)-L-rhamnopyranosyl ((\delta)(H) 5.22 (H(-)C(1({}{\rm Rha}))) and three (\beta)-d-glucopyranosyl ((\delta)(H) 4.44 (H(-)C(1({}{\rm GlcI}))), (\delta)(H) 4.91 (H(-)C(1({}{\rm GlcII})))), and (\delta)(H) 5.36 (H(-)C(1({}{\rm GlcII})))) units. The (\beta)-orientation of all three anomeric centers of the glucopyranosyl moieties was supported by the relatively large coupling constant values observed for the H(-)C(1({}{\rm GlcI})) ((d), (J) = 7.7), H(-)C(1({}{\rm GlcII})) ((d), (J) = 7.6), and H(-)C(1({}{\rm GlcIII})) ((d), (J) = 8.1). And the (\alpha)-orientation of the anomeric H-atom of the rhamnopyranosyl moiety was based on the multiplicity of the H(-)C(1({}{\rm Rha})) signal (br. (s)). The absolute configuration of the sugar residues has been tentatively determined by biogenetic considerations.
The positions of the sugar moieties were unambiguously defined by the g_HMBC experiment. A cross-peak due to long-range correlations between H(-)C(1({}{\rm GlcI})) ((\delta)(H) 4.44) and C(3) ((\delta)(C) 92.1) of the aglycone indicated that this sugar unit was linked at C(3) of the aglycone. Yet, a long-range connectivity between H(-)C(1({}{\rm GlcIII})) ((\delta)(H) 5.36) and C(28) ((\delta)(C) 178.5) indicated this sugar to be involved in an ester linkage with the C(28)OOH group. Similarly, cross-peaks were observed between H(-)C(1({}{\rm GlcII})) ((\delta)(H) 4.91) and C(2({}{\rm GlcI})) ((\delta)(C) 78.1), and between H(-)C(1({}{\rm Rha})) ((\delta)(H) 5.22) and C(2({}_{\rm GlcI})) ((\delta)(C) 79.4). On the basis of these findings, compound 2 was established to be 3(\beta)-(O)-[(\alpha)-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 (\to) 2)-(O)-(\beta)-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 (\to) 2)-(O)-(\beta)-d-glucopyranosyl]-28-(O)-(\beta)-d-glucopyranoside pomolate.
All isolated compounds were evaluated with respect to antifungal activity (Table 4), and all showed moderate antifungal activity against Candida albicans and C. krusei in a dilution assay [17]. On the other hand, none of the compounds showed inhibitory effects against Candida parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans within the concentration range tested (250.0 - 0.4 mg/ml).
The stronger activity of the AcOEt extract compared to the isolated compounds may be due to the occurrence of tannins that were detected by FeCl3 and gelatin/NaCl tests [18]. Toxicity of tannins towards microorganisms is well documented [19].
This is the first report of the isolation of a saponin from the Alibertia genus. Among the isolated compounds, only 3 had already been reported in this genus [5].

Plant Material. Alibertia edulis (Rich.) A. Rich. ex DC was collected in the surrounding of Apore - GO, Brazil, in July 2004 by Dr. C. C. da Silva and identified by Dr. I. Cordeiro. A voucher specimen (SP 370.913) was deposited at the Herbarium of Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo - SP, Brazil.
Extraction and Isolation. The dried and powdered stems (600.0 g) of A. edulis were extracted with EtOH (2 l, r.t., 3 d each time) to give a crude material (43.2 g), which was solubilized with MeOH/H2O (80 : 20, v/v) and partitioned between hexane, AcOEt, and BuOH (3 x 800 ml each one). These extracts were examined for the occurrence of tannins using FeCl3 and gelatin/NaCl tests, and evaluated for their antifungal activity. After evaporation, a part of the active AcOEt extract (0.50 g) was subjected to CC (RP18; gradient of MeOH/H2O 05 : 95 to 100 : 0, v/v). A total of nine fractions were collected and combined into seven pools (1 - 7) on the basis of similar TLC profiles. Fr. 3 (MeOH/H2O 20 : 80, v/v; 84.4 mg) was submitted to a prep.

Antifungal Assay. Microorganisms Used, and Growth Conditions. The test organisms included Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019), and Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012). The microorganisms were originally obtained from the 
Page 8
Myology Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Analysis at Sao Paulo State University (UNESP). The yeasts were grown and maintained on Sabouraud-dextrose agar for 24 h at r.t.
Antimicrobial Susceptibility TestingThe antifungal activity tests were performed using the broth microdilution method as described in the M27-A2 document of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) with modifications. The medium used was RPMI 1640, with l-glutamine buffered to pH 7.0 with 0.165m morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), supplemented with 2% glucose. The test samples were dissolved in DMSO. The cell suspension was prepared in 0.85% saline soln. with an optical density equivalent to McFarland 0.5 and diluted to 1:100 in RPMI for the final concentration to be (1\cdot 10^{5}) to (5\cdot 10^{5}) CFU/ml. This suspension was inoculated onto a microdilution plate previously prepared with the test samples diluted to concentrations from 250 mg/ml to 0.4 mg/ml. The plates were incubated under agitation at 37({}^{\circ}) for 24 h for the Candida species, and 48 h for Cryptococcus neoformans. Fungal growth was evaluated visually and spectrophotometrically. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which the optical density (OD) was reduced to 90% of the OD of the growth control well. Amphotericin B (3 mg/ml) was used as positive control and DMSO as a negative control. MIC values were determined from three independent experiments.
