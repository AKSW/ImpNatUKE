Abstract
Fourteen Brosimum species (Moraceae) contain either pyranocounarins or furocoumarins, besides (\mathcal{O})-prenyltrosiparin which gives rise to brosiprenin by a Claisen type rearrangement.
Brosimum species have so far been examined photochemically: B. gaudichaudli Trecul whose roots were reported to contain psoralen (Ia)({}^{2}) and bergapten (Ib),({}^{2,3}) and B. rubescens Taubert whose trunk wood contains xanthyletin (IIa), luvangetin (IIb), 7-demethylsuberosin (IIIa), brosiparin (IIIb) and brosiprenin (IIIc).({}^{4}) It was considered that({}^{\bullet})the biosynthesis of IIIc might involve a Claisen type rearrangement, in spite of the fact that (\mathcal{O})-prenyltrosiparin (IIId) had not been detected in the extract of B. rubescens.({}^{4}) The hypothesis, however, seemed so attractive that a search for the putative precursor IIId was undertaken in wood samples of 13 Amazonian Brosimum species. As far as TLC comparisons of extracts obtained from preserved voucher specimens merit confidence, the analysis of the results (Table 1) leads to the following comments.

exceptional amounts of prosiparin (IIIb) and prosiprenin (IIIc), and is ubiquitous in the furocoumarin section where its transformation into prosiparin (IIIb) and prosiprenin (IIIc) seems to be blocked. The biosynthetic association of IIIb and IIIc with O-prenylbrosiparin is thus a reasonable postulate. Indeed, both in nature and in the laboratory through pyrolysis of O-prenylbrosiparin (IIId),4 brosiparin (IIIb) and prosiprenin (IIIc) are formed in substantially equal amounts.
Visualization of spots Nos. 1 ((R_{f}) 024): blue fluorescence in UV, 2 ((R_{f}) 030): blue fl. in UV, 3 ((R_{f}) 042): green fl. in UV, 4 ((R_{f}) 048): brown colour with I2-vapour, 5 ((R_{f}) 049): green fl. in UV, 6 ((R_{f}) 050): blue fl. in UV, 7 ((R_{f}) 058): green fl. in UV, 8 ((R_{f}) 090): brown col. with I2-vapour. Spots Nos. 4, 5 and 6 were formed by mixtures of two compounds each. The approximate relative proportion of the constituents were determined for spot No. 4 (IIIb-IIIc, 11) with all samples using CHCl3 for their separation by TLC (the (R_{f}) value for IIIc is slightly higher than for IIIb); and for spots Nos. 5 (Ia-Ib, 81) and 6 (IIa-IIb, 20*1) only for (B). _gaudichaudii_3 and for (B). _rubescensa_4 through their isolation by column chromatography.

We were not able to locate a wood sample of (B). oleanum Kruk. Results on all other recognized Amazonian Brosimum species, however, are listed in Table 1. This records identical chromatograms for 5 pairs of extracts, a fact which suggests that a revision of the genus, already announced by Berg,5 is necessary.
