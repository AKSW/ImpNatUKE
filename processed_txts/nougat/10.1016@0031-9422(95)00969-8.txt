Monica T. Pupo, Paulo C. Vieira, Joao B. Fernandes, M. Fatima Das G. F. Da Silva
Abstract
The hexane extract of leaves of Trichilia claussenii yielded the new triterpenoid 24-methylene-26-hydroxycycloartan-3-one, 24-methylencycloartanol fatty acids derivatives, caryophyllene epoxide, a mixture of (\omega)-phenyl alkanoic and alkenoic acids, plastocromenol, (\alpha)-tocopherol, squalene, and a mixture of sitosterol and stigmasterol as free alcohols and esterified by fatty acids. The methanol extract afforded (N)-methyl-proline, 4-hydroxy-(N)-methylproline, (\omega)-phenyl alkanoic acids and a mixture of (\beta)-(O)-D-glucopyranosides of sitosterol and stigmasterol.
Introduction
Plants of the Meliaceae family have been used to control insect pests. The C-seco-imonoids have been shown to have good antifeedant activities. Azadirachtin, belonging to this group, is the most potent antifeedant [1]. These limonoids appear to be restricted to Melia and Azadirachta species, but heudebolin, a typical member of the group, was found in the park of Trichilia headelotti[2]. However, it has to be said that there is the possibility that extracts were confused during processing [2]. Clearly, much more detailed phytochemical investigations of Trichilia species will be essential. Thus, our interest in antifeedant compounds and particularly our taxonomic interest in the Meliaceae stimulated an investigation of other Brazilian plants of the Trichilia genus [3]. In this paper we report a phytochemical study on the leaves of T. claussenii DC., which grows in Sao Paulo State, Brazil.
Results and discussion
The leaves of T. claussenii were percolated with hexane, methylene chloride and methanol, respectively. The hexane extract after chromatography gave some terpenoids and (\omega)-phenyl alkanoic acids. Compound 1 appeared to be a cycloartane triterpenoid. Its IR spectrum showed absorption due to a ketonic carbonyl (1695 cm({}^{-1})) and a hydroxyl (3557 cm({}^{-1})). In the mass spectrum the parent ion observed, (m/z) 424, does not represent the molecular ion which is expected to be (m/z) 454. This means that a McLafferty type rearrangement occurred in the side chain with the loss of a fragment (m/z) 30. Its 1H NMR spectrum showed a shielded AB system ((\delta) 0.55 and 0.76, both (d), (J) = 4.4 Hz) arising from two cyclopropane protons; a doublet of doublets of doublets ((\delta) 2.29, (J) = 2.8, 4.4 and 14.0 Hz) for H-2(\omega); a triplet of doublets ((\delta) 2.68, (J) = 6.4, 13.6 and 13.6 Hz) for H-2(\beta); a septet ((\delta) 2.34, (J) = 6.8 Hz) for H-25; two superimposed doublet of doublets ((\delta) 3.49, J = 7.2 and 10.8 Hz; (\delta) 3.51, (J) = 6.4 and 10.6 Hz) for H-26; a broad singlet ((\delta) 4.79) and a broad doublet ((\delta) 4.86), both attributed to H-31 in the side chain. Based on the 'H-'H COSY spectrum it was also possible to assign the doublets ((\delta) 0.88, J = 6.0 Hz) to Me-21 and ((\delta) 1.02, (d), (J) = 6.8 Hz) to Me-27. This spectrum also showed correlation between H-26 and H-25, H-2(\beta) and H-2(\alpha) besides H-19a with H-19b. Compound 1 was acetylated, yielding the corresponding monoacetate (1a) whose 1H-'H COSY spectrum permitted the assignment of all the chemical shifts for the protons in the side chain. The attribution of chemical shifts for the carbons in the side chain of 1a was achieved by comparison with a model compound from the literature [4]. It seems that this is the first time that compound 1 has been described in the literature.
Compound 2 was also identified as a cycloartane derivative, with a fatty acid esterifying the alcohol at C-3. After hydrolysis of 2 under basic conditions, an alcohol 2a and a mixture of acids were obtained. The acids, after esterification with diazomethane and GC-mass spectral analysis, were identified as a mixture of methyl esters of fatty acids ranging from C-14 to C-26.

However, palmitic acid was identified as the major compound in this mixture. Compound 2a was shown to be 24-methylenecycloartan-3_b_-ol on the basis of its 1H NMR spectrum, which revealed two broad singlets (b 4.72 and 4.66; 2H-31); a doublet of doublets (b 3.28, (J) = 11.0 and 4.0 Hz, H-3); a heptet (b 2.24; (J) = 6.8 Hz; H-25); two doublets (b 0.55 and 0.33, 2H-19). Me-26 and Me-27 appeared as two doublets (b 1.03 and 1.02, (J) = 6.8 Hz) and Me-21 as a doublet (b 0.9, (J) = 6.0 Hz). Compound 2 had already been described and its spectral data match with those described in the literature [5].
The o-phenyl alkanoic acids (3) were identified in mixture through GC-mass spectral analysis and NMR after esterification with diazomethane. The 1H NMR spectrum showed signals of an aromatic ring (b 7.14-7.28); a broad triplet (b 5.34, (J) = 5.2 Hz), due to olefinic protons of the fatty acids with a double bond in the side chain; two triplets (b 2.59, (J) = 7.6 Hz, and (b) 2.29, (J) = 7.6 Hz) attributable to the benzyl and a-carbonyl protons respectively; a singlet (b 3.65 CO2Me), and a series of signals (b 1.0-2.0) for the methylene protons in the side chain. The 13C NMR of 3 confirmed the presence of an ester carbonyl as well as an aromatic ring and a double bond in the side chain. Analysis of the methyl esters of 3 by GC-mass spectrometry allowed us to identify and establish the ratios of each acid in the mixture as: a-phenyl decanoic (3a, 1.12%), o-phenyl undecanoic (3b, 2.45%), o-phenyl dodecanoic (3c, 36.03%), o-phenyl tridecanoic (3d, 39.95%), o-phenyl tetradecanoic (3e, 3.49%) and o-phenyl pentadecanoic (3f, 3.04%). The corresponding alkenoic acids containing 14 (3g, 3.30%) and 15 (3h, 6.15%) carbon atoms were also identified, though the position of the double bond was not established.
N-Methylproline and 4-hydroxy-N-methylproline were identified mainly on the basis of their 1H and 13C NMR spectra through comparison with the literature [6]. Both compounds were methylated with diazomethane to yield the corresponding N-dimethyl derivatives. Caryophyllene epoxide was also isolated [7].
The o-phenyl alkanoic acids can be biosynthesized
Page 3
through direct condensation of C8-C3 units with polyketide chains of different lengths. Grandinolides and other related compounds were known until recently to occur only in the Myristicaceae and Lauraceae families [8]. However, the grandinolide (4) was isolated from T. schomburgkii [9]. It has been proposed that the biosynthesis of the lactone compounds requires condensation of either a cinnamoyl or benzoyl moiety with a polyketide chain, and subsequent condensation with pyruvic acid [8]. Therefore, the isolation of 3 seems to be good evidence for this biosynthetic proposal. As far as we know this is the first report of o-phenyl alkanoic acids from plants. However, o-cyclodextrinyl-acyl and o-cycloheptyl fatty acids have been isolated from the lipids of the thermoacidophile Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius and A. cycloheptanycus [10]. The biosynthesis proposed for these compounds is based exclusively on the polyketide pathway.
EXPERIMENTAL

Isolation of constituents. Leaves of T. claussenii were collected in Rio Claro, SP, Brazil, and a voucher is deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Biociencias, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil. The leaves were dried, powdered and extracted with hexane, CH2Cl2 and MeOH. The hexane extract (28.7 g) was submitted to vacuum chromatography over silica gel using hexane, CH2Cl2, EtOAc and MeOH. The hexane ft. was chromatographed over silica gel using hexane-EtOAc (19:1), yielding cyanophyllene epoxide (14.9 mg). Chromatography of the CH2Cl2 fr. over silica gel using hexane-EtOAc (99:1) followed by prep. TLC (hexane-EtOAc, 9:1), yielded plastocromenol (30.0 mg) and a mixt. of terpenoid fatty acid derivatives. This mixt., after hydrolysis with alcoholic KOH and flash chromatography using hexane-EtOAc (9:1), afforded 24-methyl-enecycloartanol (2b) (10.0 mg), and a mixt. of sitosterol and stigmasterol. The fatty acids obtained from hydrolysis were esterified with CH2N2 and analysed by GC-MS. The EtOAc fr. was flash chromatographed over silica gel using hexane-EtOAc (9:1) followed by chromatography over florisil using hexane-EtOAc (4:1), yielding 24-methylene-26-hydroxycycloartan-3-one (1) (51.0 mg). Compound 1 was acetylated with acetic anhydride and pyridine to yield the monoacetate (1a). Chromatography of the last fr. of the EtOAc fr., firstly, over silica gel using hexane-EtOAc (4:1) and then over silica gel (flash) using hexane-Me2CO (99:1), yielded a mixt. of o-phenyl alkanoic acida acids (3) (80.0 mg), which was esterified with CH2N2 and analysed by GC-MS. From the CH2Cl2 extract using a similar procedure as above it was possible to isolate 1. The MeOH extract (19.9 g) was suspended in MeOH-H2O (1:3) and partitioned with CH2Cl2-EtOAc-n-BuOH. The CH2Cl2 fr. was coned and then partitioned with hexane-MeOH. The MeOH fr. was chromatographed on a DCCC column (CHCl3-MeOH-H2O), 5:5:3, ascending method). This led to the isolation of a mixt. of sitosterol and stigmasterol glycosides. The last fr. eluted afforded, after flash chromatography over silica gel using Me2CO-H2O (4:1), the amino acids N-methylproline (66.4 mg) and 4-hydroxy-N-methylproline (120.3 mg).
