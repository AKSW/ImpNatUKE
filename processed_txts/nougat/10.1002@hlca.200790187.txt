Introduction
Plants of the Alibertia genus are known to be a rich source of pentacyclic triterpenes [1-3]. Moreover, Alibertia belongs to the Ixoroideae subfamily in Rubiaceae, these being known for the occurrence of iridoids as main secondary metabolites [4]. Previous investigation of the leaves of A. macrophylla resulted in the isolation of non-glycosidic iridoids 1_b_- and 1_a_-hydroxydihydrocoronin aglycones, and the caffeic acid esters 2-phenylethyl caffeoate and 2-methyl-4-hydroxybutyl caffeoate [5].
This paper reports the occurrence of a new ent-kaurane diterpene (1) from A. macrophylla stems in addition to seven triterpenes 2 -8, four glucoside iridoids 9 - 12, three phenolic acids 13 -15, and two steroids 16 and 17. It is the first report of a diterpene from any Alibertia species, but ent-kauranes were previously isolated from Chiococca alba[6] and Tricalysia dubia[7] species of the family Rubiaceae.
Results and Discussion

Dried and powdered stems of Alibertia macrophylla were successively extracted with hexane, AcOEt and EtOH. The hexane extract was submitted to chromatography (column and preparative TLC) to afford lupenone (2), germanicone (3), a-amirenone (4), b-amirenone (5), lupeol (6), and oleanolic (7) and unsolic (8) acids. The AcOEt was fractionated by using a combined chromatographic column on silica gel and RP18, preparative TLC and preparative RP-HPLC to afford 6_a_- (9) and 6_b_-hydroxygeniposide (10), gardenoside (11), shanziside methyl ester (12), and protocatechuic (13), vanilic (14), and caffeic (15) acids, sitosterol (16) stigmasterol (17), and the new ent-kaurane-2(b),3(a),16_a_-triol (1).

Compounds 2 -17 were identified by comparing their 1H- and 13C-NMR data with those previously published [1][8-13].
Compound 1 was isolated as a yellow amorphous powder. The HR-ESI-MS of 1 exhibited its [M + Na]+ peak at m/z 345.2574 (calc. 345.2502), consistent with the

molecular formula C20H34O3. The IR spectrum of 1 revealed OH absorptions (3373 cm-1). The 1D and 2D NMR data (Table) revealed the presence of four Me groups ((\delta)(H) 0.69/(\delta)(C) 16.8, (\delta)(H) 0.90/(\delta)(C) 28.9, (\delta)(H) 1.00/(\delta)(C) 18.7, and (\delta)(H) 1.22/(\delta)(C) 24.3), two oxygenated CH groups ((\delta)(H) 3.45/(\delta)(C) 67.2 and (\delta)(H) 2.72/(\delta)(C) 82.3), and one oxygenated quaternary C-atom ((\delta)(C) 76.7). The ({}^{13})C-NMR spectrum also showed the presence of seven CH2 and three more CH groups, and three additional quaternary C-atoms in the molecule. Based on these data, 1 was assumed to be a trihydroxy-kaurane diterpene. On the basis of its negative specific rotation value ([(\alpha)]({}{7}^{27}) = (-)1.36), it is suggested that 1 belongs to the _ent-kaurane series, similarly to the ent-kaurane series. The

other analogous diterpenes [14][15]. The assignments of C(2) and C(3) were confirmed by the cross-peak correlations in the gHMQC spectrum of H(-)C(2) ((\delta) 3.45) and H(-)C(3) ((\delta) 2.72) with the ({}^{13})C signals at (\delta) 67.2 and (\delta) 82.3, respectively, as well as the long-range connectivities shown by the gHMBC spectrum between the signals ascribed to H(-)C(18) ((\delta) 0.90) and (\delta) 82.3, and between H(-)C(19) ((\delta) 0.69) and (\delta) 82.3. The Me(20) group and H(-)C(5) are (\alpha)- and (\beta)-oriented, respectively, on biogenetic grounds [16]. The configuration at C(16) was determined as ((R)), the OH group at which has an equatorial orientation ((\alpha)) and the Me(17) group has an axial orientation ((\beta)). In this case, a chemical shift at C(16) (((R))-configuration) appears at (\delta)(C) 76 - 79, and if C(16) has the configuration ((S)), the chemical shift would be (\delta)(C) 81 - 82. NOESY Interactions observed between H(-)C(5) ((\delta)(H) 0.76) and H(-)C(3) ((\delta)(H) 2.72), and also between H(-)C(5) ((\delta)(H) 0.76) and H(-)C(9) ((\delta)(H) 0.89 - 0.95) indicated the axial orientations ((\beta)) of H(-)C(5), H(-)C(3), and H(-)C(9) (Fig.). The configuration at C(2) was determined from the multiplicity and coupling constant observed for H(-)C(2) and H(-)C(3) from the 1D TOCSY spectrum, and from interactions found for

H - C(3) in NOESY spectrum. From the NOESY spectrum, H - C(3) was defined as being in an axial position (b), and its coupling constant of 9.5 Hz indicated that H - C(2) is also in an axial position but with an a-orientation. Compound 1 was, therefore, identified as ent-kaurane-2b,3(a),16_a_-triol.
Thus, this is the first report of this ent-kaurane in literature, and it is the first report of the isolation of a diterpene from the Alibertia genus in Rubiaceae. The occurrence of triterpenes 2 - 8, iridoids 9 - 12, and phenolic acids 13 - 15 in Alibertia is in agreement with chemosystematic correlations and botanical positioning of this genus in the subfamily Ixoroideae [17].
