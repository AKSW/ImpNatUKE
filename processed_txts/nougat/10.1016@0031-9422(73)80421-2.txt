Abstract
Virola species; Myristicaceae; chemotaxonomy; diarylpropanoids; alkaloids.
Virola [1-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-propane] and virolanol [2-hydroxy-1-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-propane], two diarylpropanoids recently isolated from the wood of Virola multimervia Ducke1 (Myristicaceae, INPA 2855/21157, Ducke Reserve Manaus), were found to occur additionally in the wood of V. venosa (Benth.) Warb. (INPA 1947/13996, Ducke Reserve, Manaus), V. divergens Ducke (INPA 2818/14787, Ducke Reserve, Manaus), V. melinoni (Benoist) A.C.Sm. (INPA 1315/10356), Navio Mt., Amapa), V. paonis (A.DC.) A.C.Sm. (INPA 599/5160, Ducke Reserve, Manaus) and V. surinamensis (Roland) Warb. (INPA 632/5593, Benjamin Constant, Amazonas); and to be absent from V. calophylla Spr. ex Warb. (INPA 2036/14207, Ducke Reserve, Manaus), V. elongata (Benth.) Warb. (Codajas, Amazonas), V. rufula Warb. (INPA 2001/14013, Ducke Reserve, Manaus) and V. multicostata Ducke (IPEAN 31005/--, Madeira river, Para). Among the group of species which contain diarylpropanoids, V. multinervia and V. venosa were previously examined phytochemically, and it was shown that their bark, root and leaves are almost devoid of alkaloids.2 In contrast, most of the species of the second group are renowned hallucinogenic plants, due to the presence of tryptamine derivatives2 in V. theiodora (Spr. ex Bh.) Warb., by some considered to be synonymous with V. rufula,3,4_V. rufula_ and V. calophylla; and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-b-carboline derivatives in V. theiodora and V. rufula. V. cuspidata (Benth.) Warb. considered to be synonymous with _V. elongata_4,5 contains 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroharman derivatives.6
