Abstract
The methanol extract of stems of Trichilia claussenii yielded three new steroids: 2a,3a-dihydroxy-androstan-16-one 2(b),19-hemiketal, 2a,3b-dihydroxypregnantan-16-one 2(b),19-hemiketal, 2(b),3b-dihydroxypregnantan-16-one. Two known steroids 2(b),3(b),4_b_-trihydroxypregnantan-16-one, 2a,3a,4b-trihydroxypregnantan-16-one and a mixture of sitosterol and stigmasterol b-_O-D-glucopyranoside were also isolated. The structures of the isolated compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. (\copyright) Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved
INTRODUCTION
The Meliaceae is known to be a rich source of limonoids, which possess interesting biological activities against insects such as antifeeding, deterrent and inhibitors of ecdyasis [1]. As part of our interest in the chemistry of the family Meliaceae, we have recently reported the isolation of cycloartane triterpenoids, carcyophyllene epoxide and a mixture of o-phenyl alkanoic and alkenoic acids from the leaves of Trichilia claussenii DC. collected in Brazil [2]. In continuation of the study of this species, we have investigated the stems extracts of T. claussenii. We have not found limonoids in this plant, but here we report the isolation and identification of steroids from stems of T. claussenii.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The methanol extract of the stems of Trichilia claussenii was submitted to solvent partition followed by several column chromatographies. This procedure led to the isolation of a series of steroids which were identified as following.
The DCIMS of 1 showed the [M + H] peak m/z 321 and the 13C NMR spectrum showed 19 carbon signals. The multiplicities of the carbons determined by DEPT 135 led to the attribution of: 4 C, 5 CH, 9 CH2 and 1 CH3, allowing us to propose the molecular formula (C_{16}H_{2}O_{4}) for compound 1, an androstane steroid. Among the quaternary carbons one was attributed to a hemiketal (d 107.8), one CH carbonic (d 73.2), one CH2 carbonic (d 66.1), one carbonyl (d 217.8) and only one methyl carbon (d 17.8). The presence of only one methyl group led us to propose that the second one for androstane steroids was replaced by a hydroxymethylene group which is part of the cyclic hemiketal moiety (d 4.10, 3.89, both (d), (J) = 8.0 Hz). The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed another AB coupling system for 2H-1 (d 2.30, 2.40, both (d), (J) = 11.2 Hz), which led us to propose the position of the hemiketal ring between C-2 and C-19. Other possibilities of ring closure of the hemiketal were ruled out mainly through analysis of the NMR data. Analysis of HMBC, HMQC and NOEDIF of 1, together with the 1H-1H COSY of its acetate 1a confirmed the positioning of the hemiketal ring. In the 1H-1H COSY a "H" coupling was observed between H-3 (d 5.41, ddd, (J) = 1.7, 2.7, 3.3 Hz) and H-1b (d 2.50, dd, (J) = 1.7, 11.5 Hz), indicating an a-configuration for the hydroxyl at C-3. In the HMBC experiment the following were the most important correlations observed: C-2/H-3, C-3/H-1b, C-5/H-1b, C-5/H-1a and C-3/H-5, other correlations are described in Table 3. NOEDIF was also used to confirm the structure for compound I: when H-19a was irradiated an NOE was observed with H-1b, H-11b and H-8. Irradiation of H-19b caused a NOE for H-4b, H-6b and II-8, other NOEs are described in Table 4.
All the information above confirmed the structure of 1 with this new arrangement containing the hemiketal between C-2 and C-19.

Compound 2 was also found to be a steroid very closely related to 1. The m/z 349 [M + H]- peak observed for 2 in the DCIMS requires two more carbon atoms in relation to 1, and this was confirmed by the 13C NMR spectrum which showed 21 signals. The combination of the data above with the 1H NMR spectrum showing a methyl signal (d 1.04, (t), (J) = 7.2 Hz) led to the molecular formula C21H2O4 for this pregnane steroid. As observed for compound 1, compound 2 also displays a hemiketal ring between C-2 and C-19. This observation was deduced on the basis of spectral analysis 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HMBC, HMQC and NOEDIF (Tables 1-4). For compound 2 the coupling constants obtained for H-3 (d 4.15, dd, (J) = 6.0, 10.4) allowed us to propose a b-configuration for the hydroxyl group at C-3. Other differences observed in the 1H NMR spectra of compounds 1 and 2 refer to the chemical shifts for H-1a and H-1b which are very close for compound 1 (D  d 0.10) and more distinct for 2 (D  d 1.17), this difference might be due to the influence of pyridine and its different association to the hydroxyl groups. To check and confirm this possibility 1H NMR spectra for both compounds were run in methanol-_d_d, and both H-1a and H-1b were taken in the same experiment. The 1H
Page 3
were shown to be more shielded in comparison with the chemical shifts observed in pyridine-d__s. When 2 was submitted to acetylation with acetic anhydride in pyridine and catalytic amounts of DMAP, two diacetates were obtained. One referring to the acetylation of the alcohol and hemiketal 2a, and the second 2b corresponding to the diacetate which originated from the opening of the hemiketal.
Compounds 3 and 4 were isolated from T. schomburgkii[3, 4] for the first time. All 13C NMR spectra obtained for compounds 3 and 4 are in agreement with those reported in the literature (Table 1). However, in the 1H NMR spectra for compounds 3 and 4, it was not possible to observe the multiplicities for the carbonicit protons (H-2, H-3 and H-4), in spite of the fact that they displayed the same chemical shifts, when the spectra were run in the same solvent. However, the compounds were obtained as triacetate derivatives 3a and 4a,where the multiplicities of H-2, II-3 and H-4 were the same as observed for the natural products described in the literature. Compound 3a showed in the 1H NMR spectrum a W-coupling between H-2 and H-4, as described for the natural product 3 isolated from T. schomburgkii[3]. In the HIMBC experiments due to the very close chemical shifts observed for C-2 and C-3 it was not possible to assign unequivocally each correlation. The following correlations for the carbonicit protons were observed for 3: C-10/H-2, C-10/H-4,C-2 or C-3/H-2, C-2 or C-3/H-4, C-2 or C-3/H-3 and C-4/H-4. For compound 4 the correlations observed for the carbonicit protons were: C-1/H-3, C-10/H-4, C-2/H-4, C-3/H-2, C-3/H-3 and C-4/H-4. In the literature [3] the long-range 1H-13C correlations observed for a monoacetate of 3 are limited to those involving methyl hydrogens. Compounds 3 and 4 showed different melting points and [a]D from those described in the literature. However, the duplication of the Me-18 signals observed in the 1H NMR for compounds 2 and 4 suggests the epimerization of C-17 when the NMR spectra were run in pyridine.
The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra for compound 5 were very similar to those for 3 and 4. The only difference observed was due to the presence of only two hydroxyl groups attached to the ring A. The positioning of the hydroxyls and their stereochemistry were determined through analysis of 1H NMR and 13C NMR of 5 and its diacetatc 5a. The signals (d 4.04, (m), and (d) 3.65 ddd, (J) = 4.0, 4.8, 11.2 Hz) displayed in 1H NMR of 5 led us to propose a cis-relationship between H-2 and H-3, where H-2 is equatorial and H-3 is axial. This was confirmed by the 1H-1H COSY spectrum of 5a which showed that the acetylcarbonic protons are coupling to each other, and with two other different protons. Therefore, the hydroxyls are vicinals and located at C-2 and C-3. The comparison of the chemical shifts and multiplicities of H-2 in 5,
Page 4
with the data of 3 and 4, allowed us to propose the configuration for H-2 equatorially oriented, and H-3 axially. Therefore, both hydroxyls have the (\beta)-configuration. The possibility of different stereochemistry for both hydroxyls was ruled out through comparison of the ({}^{13})C NMR with models from the literature [5].
The androstane (1) and pregnane (2) 2B,19-hemiketal represent a novel group of steroids from plants [6]. The closest analogues of this nucleus would appear to be the pregnane-10,2-carbolactones isolated from the sponge species Strongylophora sp. [7]. Pregnane derivatives have been isolated from the Meliaceae (Melia azedarach var. japonica[8], Melia toosendon[9, 10], Turrea villosa[11] and Trichilia schomburgki[3, 4]), Simaroubaceae (Allanthus grands[12]) and from Burseraceae (Compinibora mukul[13]). Thus, compounds 1 and 2 show a significant enlargement of the patterns of pregnanes production previously noted in the Rutales, and a significant chemotaxonomic evidence in favour of the link between these three families.
