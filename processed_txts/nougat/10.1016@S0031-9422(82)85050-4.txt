Abstract
The trunk wood of an Amazonian Aniba (Lauraceae) species contains, besides dillapiol and the benzodiazepane-type neolignan eusiderin, four bicyclo(3.2.1)octainol neoplasms. These comprise representatives of the cancelling-type: the known thermodynamicellin-A and the novel compounds characterized as (1R, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7R)-1-allyl-4-hydroxy-3, 5-dimethoxy-7-methyl-6-(3'-methoxy-4', 5'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-8-oxo-bicyclo(3.2.1)octane; (1R, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7R)-1-allyl-4-hydroxy-3, 5-dimethoxy-7-methyl-6-(3', 4', 5'-trifluoromethyl-6-(3'-methoxy-4', 5'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-8-oxo-bicyclo(3.2.1)octane and (1R, 4R, 5R, 6S, 7R, 8S)-1-allyl-4, 8-dihydroxy-5-methoxy-7-methyl-6-(3'-methoxy-4', 5'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-3-oxbicyclo(3.2.1)octane.
Introduction
The trunk wood of a lauraceous tree was collected at Ducke Forest Reserve, Manaus. According to the botanist William A. Rodrigues, the specimen, voucher Herbarium INPA, Manaus, no. 42183, belongs to an unclassified Aniba species. The benzene extract of trunk wood yielded the simple allylbenzene diligul (1), the benzodiazepane-type neolignan eusiderin (2) [2] and four cancellin-type neolignan: methoxycancellin-A (3a) and the novel compounds 4a, 4b and 5a.
For reasons stated in a previous paper in this series [3], nomenclature and numbering of neolignan s follow the rules outlined in a recent review [2].
Results and discussion
Spectral analysis ('H NMR, IR, UV and MS) showed 3a to be a methoxy-derivative of 3b (canellin-A) [4]. The compound had already been isolated previously from Aniba ferrea. Its description, however, lacked definition of the chirality at C-5' [5]. The following evidence elucidates this point and indicates 3a and canellin-A (3b) to possess identical absolute configurations. Acetylation of 3a at room temperature led to the monoacetate 3c. The steric

hindrance of the hydroxyl at C-2' is best explained by its cis-relation with the aryl group, precisely as in the case of canellin-A [2]. The aryl being thus exo-oriented, the benzylic proton (H-7) and the methyl (Me-8) must be endo-oriented. Since the signals of both undergo significant paramagnetic shifts (D  respectively 0.44 and 0.09) upon acetylation of OH-4', this hydroxyl must be equally endo-oriented. In consequence H-4' can only be axial. Being represented by a doublet of (J) = 6.5 Hz it is probably vicinal to another axial proton (H-5') and OMe-5' should be equatorial. Indeed, as would be expected for the OH-4'/H-5' cis-relation, acetylation of OH-4' produces a significant paramagnetic shift (D 0.28) of the H-5' signal. With respect to its relative configuration methoxycanellin-A (3a) is thus identical with canellin-A (3b) [4]. Both compounds also share the absolute configuration since their ORD curves are comparable.
Spectral comparison ('H NMR including consideration of all relevant decouplings at 270 MHz, IR, UV and MS) indicated 4a to differ from 3a solely by the presence of an oxo-group (instead of a hydroxyl) on the five-membered ring (IR n_max 1757 cm-1) and of an exo-hydroxyl (instead of an endo-oriented one) at C-4'. Indeed H-8 and the aromatic protons resonated at higher field in 4a (_t respectively ca 8.2 and 3.7), where they are shielded by the C-2' carbonyl, than in 3a (t respectively ca 7.6 and 3.4). Furthermore H-4' showed two small couplings (J = 2 and < 0.5 Hz), due to equatorial-axial and equatorial-equatorial (W) relationships, respectively, with H-5' and one H-6', in 4a; against one relatively large coupling (J = 6.5 Hz), due to the axial-axial relationship with H-5', in 3a. As was expected, in contrast to the situation prevailing in 3a (OMe-3', + 6.80), in 4a OH-4' on one hand does not affect paramagnetically the signals of H-7, Me-8 and H-5' upon acetylation, and on the other hand affects sterically the now cis-related OMe-3' forcing it towards the shielding region of the aromatic ring (OMe-3', + 7.18) (Table 1).
Compounds 4a and 4b differ only with respect to the substituents of the aromatic ring: the methylenedioxy group of 4a is replaced by two methoxyls in 4b (Table 1).
The constitution of 5a was assigned on the basis of spectral comparisons with 5b, a known canellin-type neolignan [6]. The spectral differences can be rationalized by analogy with the pair 4a/3a, i.e. again OH-4' occupies either an exo- (in 5a, OMe-3', + 7.17) or an endo- (in 5b, OMe-3', + 6.67) position (Table 1). With respect to its relative configuration 5a is thus identical to 5c, a neolignan of known absolute configuration [7]. The ORD curves of both compounds being similar, 5a and 5c also share the absolute configuration shown in the formulae.
EXPERIMENTAL
Isolation of constituents. Trunk wood of an Aniba species (voucher Herbarium INPA, no. 42183) was reduced to powder (2 kg) and percolated with C4H6. Evaporation of solvent yielded an oily residue (6 g). This was chromatographed on a dry column (250 g Si gel deactivated by 10% H2O, Et2O). Eluates of ten equal portions of the extruded material were treated as follows. Eluate 1 (1 g) was separated by TLC (Si gel, C4H6) into fatty material (0.7 g) and 1 (0.3 g). Eluates 2 (1.2 g) and 3 (0.2 g), purified by repeated Si gel TLC (CHCl1, and CHCl2-EtO, 49:1, respectively), yielded 2 (0.6 g) and 3a (50 mg), respectively. Eluate 4 (1.1 g) yielded, by re-crystallizations from MeOH, sitosterol (0.7 g) and by Si gel TLC (C4H6-Me2CO, 4:1) of the mother liquor, sitosterol (50 mg) and 3a (0.1 g). Eluates 5 (0.3 g) and 6 (0.5 g), purified by repeated Si gel TLC (C6H6-Me2CO, 4:1 and C6, respectively), yielded 4a (0.1 g) and 4b (15 mg), respectively. Eluate 7 (0.5 g), by Si gel TLC (CHCl7-EtOH, 9:1), was separated into 5a (20 mg) and polar material. Eluates 8-10 were complex mixtures of polar compounds.
Identification of dilapid (1) [4] and eusielin (2) [8] relied on direct comparison with authentic samples.
