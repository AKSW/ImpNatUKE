Abstract
A set of five fungal species, Botrytis cinerea, Trichoderma viride and Eutypa lata, and the endophytic fungi Colletotrichum crassipes_ and Xylaria sp., was used in screening for microbial biocatalysts to detect monooxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities (for the stereoselective reduction of carbonyl compounds). 4-Ethylcyclohexanone and acetophenone were biotransformed by the fungal set. The main reaction pathways involved reduction and hydroxylation at several positions including tertiary carbons. B. cinerea was very effective in the bioreduction of both substrates leading to the chiral alcohol (5)-1-phenylethanol in up to 90x enantiomeric excess, and the cis-trans ratio for 4-ethylcyclohexanol was 0:100. trans-4-Ethyl-1-(15-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanol, obtained from biotransformation by means of an acyloin-type reaction, is reported here for the first time. The absolute configurations of the compounds trans-4-ethyl-1-(15-hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanol and 4-(15- and 4-(1R-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanone were determined by NMR analysis of the corresponding Mosher's esters.
Introduction
Interest in integrating traditional organic chemistry and biocatalysis has increased dramatically over the past decade.1 Biocatalytic reactions that employ either enzymes or whole cells are well suited for green chemistry because mild conditions are applied in these reactions by lowering the energy requirements; fewer by-products are formed as they are highly chemo-, regio- and stereoselective, and multi-step chemical syntheses can be achieved in just a few steps via biocatalysis.2 As a result, biocatalytic processes are often cheaper and more direct than their chemical counterparts.3
The use of microorganisms is advantageous because of the growth and easy formation of the multienzymatic system.4 One crucial aspect to be considered for a successful microbial biotransformation is the selection of the natural source to be studied. In this work, whole cells from three filamentous fungi and two endo-phytic fungi were tested as biocatalysts. Endophytic fungi are an unexplored or at least under-explored source for microbial biotransformations.5
Therefore, as a part of our research program focusing on the study of the biocatalytic potential of filamentous fungi, we herein report the biotransformation of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1 and acetophenone 2, two well-known pro-chiral ketones, by the filamentous fungi Botrytis cinerea, Trichoderma viride and Eutypa lata, and the endophytic microorganisms Colletotrichum crassipes and Xylaria sp., in order to detect monooxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities.6,7
Results and discussion
The selected set of five fungal species mentioned above was used in the screening of microbial biocatalysts to detect monooxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities. The reduction of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1 to 4-ethylcyclohexanol 1a was used as the first reaction in the screening.
Biotransformation of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1
4-Ethylcyclohexanone 1 was subjected to the action of whole cells of five filamentous fungi, B. cinerea, E. lata, T. viride, C. crassipes and Xylaria sp. to verify the biocatalytic potential of these fungi in the biotransformation of ketones. The results of the biotransformations are presented in Tables 1 (static cultures) and 2 (shaken cultures) in terms of isolated yields and the predominant configurations of the products obtained. Shaken cultures were included in order to observe differences resulting from the degree of oxidation.

Following a period of incubation for each fungus, several bio-transformation products 1a-1e were detected. Product structure assignment was done by NMR analysis as described in Section 4.
4-Ethylcyclohexanone 1 was reduced to the corresponding cis- and trans-alcohol8 (Scheme 1). As shown in Tables 1 and 2, B. cinea rea and C. crassipes gave the trans-4-ethylcyclohexanol trans-1a with a cis-trans ratio of 0:100, and E. lata with a cis-trans ratio of 3:97 and a yield of ~47%. cis-alcohol 1a was produced by T. viride with a cis-trans ratio of 65:35. Most of the biotransformations occurred with low conversion because several products were formed.
In addition to the bioreduction of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1, B. cinea and C. crassipes produced 4-(1-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanol 1b.9 B. cinea

The formation of 1c can be explained assuming the formation of a C-C bond by means of an enzyme-type pyruvate decarboxylase leading to a chiral a-hydroxy ketone. The two-carbon unit originating from the decarboxylation of pyruvate is transferred to the ketone substrate. Presumably, an alcohol dehydrogenase present in the whole cell stereoselectively reduces the ketone of the acyloin and an erythro diol is formed instead. This is the first time that an acyloin-type enzymatic reaction with a ketone as substrate is reported. We propose the mechanism showed in Scheme 2.
Another interesting transformation of 1 was oxidation at tertiary carbon C-4 by the endophytic fungus Xylaria sp. which is unusual for fungal biotransformations. 4-Ethyl-4-hydroxycyclohexanone 1d had been previously prepared [13] but it is reported here for the first time as a biotransformation product.
The biotransformation of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1 by the endophytic fungi Xylaria sp. and C. crassipes also produced another compound, 1c, whose 13C NMR spectrum was consistent with the molecular formula C8H14O2, exhibiting signals for one methyl, four methylene, two methylene and one quaternary carbon. The 'H NMR spectrum was close to that of 4-ethylcyclohexanone 1, but the presence of a signal at 70.7 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum (C-7) and two signals at 3.73 ppm (q, 1H) and 1.25 ppm (d, 3H) in the 'H NMR spectrum suggest that this compound was hydroxylated at C-7. The stereochemistry of this product was confirmed by means of the corresponding Mosher esters. [11] According to this method, we analysed the 'H NMR spectra of the MPA esters of compound 1e resulting from the biotransformation by Xylaria sp. on surface cultures at 10 days. The positive value of D_d_d_d_d_d for H-8 (+0.15) and the negative value of

3 Conclusions
In summary, the studies described above demonstrate the bio-catalytic potential of the filamentous fungi B. cinerea, T. viride, E. lacta, C. crassipes and Xylaria sp. in obtaining biotransformation compounds with high enantiomeric purity from prochiral ketones. The main reaction paths involved reduction and hydroxylations at several positions including tertiary carbons. The latter case is not very typical in fungal biotransformations. Thus, 4-ethyl-4-hydroxycyclohexanone 1d is obtained by the endophytic fungus Xylaria sp.
4-Ethylcyclohexanone 1 was reduced to the corresponding cis and trans-alcohols by all the fungi with medium to high enantiomeric purity, except by Xylaria sp. B. cinerea was very effective in the bioreduction of both substrates leading to the chiral alcohol (S)-1-phenyl-ethanol (S)-2a with up to 90% enantiomeric excess and the ratio of cis- and trans-4-ethylcyclohexanol 1a was shown to be 0:100.
Moreover, the absolute configurations of the compounds trans-4-ethyl-1-(1S-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanol 1c and 4-(1R-hydroxyethyl)cyclohexanone 1e were determined by NMR analysis of the corresponding Mosher's esters. The first one, 1c, reported here for the first time, was obtained through biotransformation by T. viride and E. lacta by means of an atypical acyloin-type reaction.
The high yields observed for Europa and its ability to carry out an unreported acyloin-type reaction seem to indicate that this fungus could be a potential biocatalyst.
4 Experimental
General experimental procedures
Optical rotations were determined using a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. IR spectra were recorded on a Mattson Genesis spectrophotometer, series FTIR. 1H and 13C NMR measurements were obtained on Varian Gemini 300 and Varian Unity 400 NMR spectrometers with SiMe4 as the internal reference. Mass spectra were recorded on a GC-MS Thermoquest spectrometer (model: Voyager) and a VG Autospec-Q spectrometer. HPLC was performed with a Hitachi/Merck L-6270 apparatus equipped with a UV-vis detector (L 6200) and a differential refractometer detector (RI-71). TLC was performed on Merck Kiesegel 60 F254, 0.2 mm thick. Silica gel (Merck) was used for column chromatography. Purification by means of HPLC was accomplished with a silica gel column (Hilbar 60, 7 m, 1 cm wide, 25 cm long). Chemicals were products of Fluka or Aldrich. All solvents used were freshly distilled.
Microorganism cultures
The B. cinerea culture employed in this work, B. cinerea (UCA 992), was obtained from grapes from the Domecq vineyard, Jerez de la Frontera, Cadiz, Spain. This culture of B. cinerea is deposited in the Universidad de Cadiz, Facultad de Ciencias, Mycological Herbarium Collection (UCA). The E. lacta and T. viride cultures used were obtained from the 'Coleccion Espanola de Cultivos Tipo' (CECT), Facultad de Biologia, Universidad de Valencia, Spain, where cultures of these strains are deposited. C. crassipes and Xylaria sp. were isolated as endophytes from the plant Casera sylvestris (Flacourtiaceae) from Cerrado do Estado de Sao Paulo (Brazil),17 These strains are deposited in the Herbario do Instituto de Botancia de Sao Paulo (Brazil).
Determination of enantiomeric purity
The enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric excesses of 1b were determined by chiral GC analyses on a Cyclosil-B, 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm column using a Perkin-Elmer, Clarus 400 gas chromatograph; split at 50 mL/min, flow rate 1.1 mL/min, hydrogen as a gas carrier; trans-(major)-1bfa = 4.76 min, trans-(minor)-1bfa = 5.87 min; cis-(minor)-1bfa = 4.54 min, cis-(major)-1bfa = 4.75 min.
The enantiomeric purity of 2a and 2b was determined by means of HPLC analyses on a chiral column (Chiralcel OD, Daicel, Japan): 254 nm, 0.8 mL/min, hexane/isopropanol (9:1); (R)-2afa = 7.4 min, (S)-2afa = 8.6 min, (R)-2bfa = 20.6 min, (S)-2bfa = 22.0 min. The absolute configurations were attributed by comparison with those from the literature.15,16
General procedure for biotransformation
Fungi were grown at 25 degC on a Czapeck-Dox medium (B. cinerea UCA 992) or on a PDB medium (T. viride, E. lacta, C. crassipes and Xylaria sp.) (150 mL per bottle and 200 mL per flask). The shaken cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker at 140 rpm. The substrates were dissolved in ethanol and then distributed over Roux bottles or flasks (150 ppm per flask) and the fermentation continued for a further period, after which the mycelium was filtered and then washed with brine and ethyl acetate. The broth was extracted three times with ethyl acetate and the extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was then evaporated and the residue was chromatographed first on a silica gel column and then with HPLC with an increasing gradient of ethyl acetate to petroleum ether.
