tion of linear growth differed more among test species than did overall fresh weight. Even the most sensitive assay, root extension in lettuce required a splitin concentration of 03 mM. Levels of this magnitude are not indicative of a particularly potent regulator. However, the reported sisoltin contents of 013-122% (fr. wt) [1,2] corresponds to ca 4-37 mmol/kg of tissues hence fall easily within the range of inhibitory concentrations.
The concept of psisoltin as part of a regulatory system is reinforced by the demonstration that its inhibitory effects are reversed by glutathione, other thio-compounds and gibberellin A3 (Table 2). Glutathione, thiourea and thioproline at 1 mM restore nearly full germination to seeds near the ID50 level in 5 mM psisoltin. Hydroxyproline, lacking the reducing group, is inactive, but gibberellin A3 is ca 10-100-fold more active than the thiols. These responses underscore the coumarin-like character of psisoltin [4-6] as well as its potential role in growth regulation.
EXPERIMENTAL
Test materials used in the survey included seeds of turnip, Brassica rapa CV Purple Top White Globe; lettuce, Lactuca serine cv Iceberg; and onion, Allum cepa CV Yellow Globe. Seed and seedling tests were carried out in petri dishes on moist filter paper at 24deg under 500 lx daylight fluorescent light. Germination data are based upon 4-5 replicates each with 75-125 seeds. Growth measurements were based upon triplicates of 35-50 seedlings each. ID50 values (concentrations required for 50% inhibition) were obtained by graphical interpolation. Psioltin was provided by Professor G. H. N. Towers, University of British Columbia.

due to o-quinonemethic ions characterize 1,3-diarylpropanes with o-hydroxyl [1,3]. In the present case such a peak would appear at m/e 136. Its absence locates the methoxyl at the o-position. Since thus the OH in the ring under scrutiny must occupy the p-position, a positive Gibbs test of the compound locates the OH of the other ring at the m-position, as in 1a. This is the isomer of the Gibbs test negative metabolite 1b of Iryanthera coriacea Ducke for which very similar 1HMR and MS were reported [3].

INTRODUCTION
Since their discovery by Lester [1] and Morton [2], ubiquiones have received much attention from many workers in various fields of research. In the case of cultured plant cells, Threfall and Goodwin [3] reported the occurrence of ubiquinone-10 in Paul's earlier rose while Thomas and Stobart examined the time-course of ubiquinone and a-tocopherol formation in Kalanchee crenata callus [4].
According to our investigations [5], tobacco cells in suspension culture appear to contain much more ubiquinone-10 than the parent plants and so might be a suitable source for the large scale production of this compound. In order to obtain basic information on the synthesis of ubiquinone-10 by cultured plant cells, some observations on the variation in the ubiquinone content during the growth of the cultured cells have been made and are detailed in this paper.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The time-course of ubiquinone formation during cell growth was examined using three kinds of cultured cells, which have a high growth rate in suspension culture (Fig 1.) The clone BY-2 reached a maximum dry weight 6 days after inoculation, while their ubiquinone content decreased during the early period of the logarithmic phase of growth and then increased reaching the highest level (360 (\mu)g per g-dry weight) on the 10th day (Fig. 1). Changes in the ubiquinone content of Xanthi cells were
